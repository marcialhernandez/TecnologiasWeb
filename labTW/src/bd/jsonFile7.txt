The setting seemed so eerie that I figured there was no way that they could screw it up. I was wrong. I tried so desperately to like this movie when I saw it, but I just couldn't. The plot is absolutely terrible, as with a equally bad script. They try to overshadow this with some stunning visual effects from Industrial Lights and Magic (which were stunning), but it can't make up for something that isn't there. The performances by the leading actress (the one that plays the great-granddaughter of the original mansion's owner) and the lot are really bad, although I am going to put most of the blame here on a bad script. Most... Also, the ending to this movie seemed so off. Did anyone else get this feeling? At a few points it almost feels like they cut a few scenes out that caused it to be as disjunct as it was. It left me wondering why I had just wasted my time and money seeing it in the first place. There are many many other horror/suspense movies that beat this one. I suggest you go elsewhere if you haven't seen this movie but are considering to buy it. 1 star for the special effects.",

    "review/text": "I haven't read Shirley Jackson's novel, but I've seen the old movie and this one. Compared to the 1963-movie, this one is quite different, at least the story. But I like it. I like the characters, they're quite similar to those in the original movie. The insecure, nervous Nell (Lili Taylor), self confident Luke (Owen Wilson) and Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The actors are good (I forgot to mention Liam Neeson as Dr Marrow), also the supporting actors, for example Marian Seldes as the creepy Mrs. Dudley.The special effects are impressing and the music is also very good. One thing that feels unnecessary is that the filmmakers seem to have tried to give the movie a creepy, 'haunting', feeling too early, even in the end of the first scene, in Nell's bedroom.I like this movie and I think it's quite underrated. It has a number of good scenes. The scene with the photo album with the pictures of Hugh and Carolyn Crain is a favorite... It's nice to see a good new haunted house movie.",

Knowing Shirley Jacksons brilliant novel and knowing the also brilliant movie by Robert Wise from 1963 I was kind of sceptic when I heard that &quot;Mr. No-Content&quot; Jan DeBont would direct a remake of that movie. And believe me, I was not disappointed. They simplified the story (mabye Hollywood thinks that we, the audience, are too stupid for a psychological ghost story). They erased every psychological aspect from the story, which is quite an achievement when you do a movie based on a book that was all about psychology. They miscast all the actors. Especially Liam Neeson was not worth his money - stoically saying his lines like a zombie. They threw in completely useless and childish looking special effects. They built a house which wouldn't have been built the way it is shown in the movie back in the victorian times. They basically did everything wrong in this movie. When will Hollywood producers learn that real thrills come from the things you DON'T see (like shown in Robert Wise's brilliant adaption of the book) and not from throwing in hundreds of special effects?Well, this absolutely horrible movie shows us two things: 1) ...that everybody should stay away from this movie 2) ...that cameramen should not be allowed to become directors.",

Plus, the ending was absolutely terrible and stupid. The main character in the story was such a bizzare character you really couldn't relate to her at all. The other characters were pretty weird too, but they were just funny. The special effects were OK, but it really annoyed me that those stupid statues kept coming to life to make the movie go on and on. There were so many many comedy aspects of this movie that it was hard to tell sometimes whether it was a comedy or a horror movie(such as the fact that all the characters had problems that were very obvious). I don't know about the old version of this movie, but the new one really sucks.",

But if there were a couple of glitches than it would be with the person that they got to play Eleanore in the movie since they got the other three characters spot on, but with Nell it became a total pain after a while especially when they thought that she was losing it. I have to say that the special FX were really good as well and you can almost see for yourself where the trouble is going to lead after she figures out what happened in the house and her connection to it. As if that's not enough,the characters are also dealing with their own fears like claustraphobia and acraphobia and to top it off it also pulls out some poultergeist encounters what with the moving statues, and objects, strange noises, temperature changes and being pulled into things. My personal favorite was the conversation in the music room and the way Neesons'character gave the history of the house followed by the jolt of nerves from the fireplace when the something in it exploded and he finished telling the story. So it gives off an eerie feel to it to the point where you're sitting on the edge of your seat. For any who have seen the first movie and poultergeist this gives off a bit of both and still has a bit of humor in it. After seeing this as an adult, I say give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.",

Like HOHH, it is a remake of the original of the same name. The original Haunting was quite good for it's day. But let's be honest...it's not it's day anymore.But what annoyed ME most about this movie was Lillie Taylor's character. I just didn't like how she whispered every word and was a bit of a weirdo. The ending's a little corny but some decent frights throughout make up for that.The sound design in the cinema was incredible. It was very scary and you really did feel like there were ghosts behind you and from every other direction. Most impressive indeed.HOHH tried to be quick and frenetic. In doing so it lost character and dialogue. But The Haunting takes a little bit of time to build and in some places is almost a psychological horror. For these ambitions alone, it is better than House on Haunted Hill.",

    "review/text": "I was excited about seeing this movie. I really was. It started out like the book, kind of, but of course, like so many movies today, the special effects took over and then we went on the most boring roller coster ride that was ever created. Suddenly, the house wasn't just evil, it had to be the actual evil man who inhabited it. Yeah, that wasn't in the book. Then it tried to regain our sympathy after it tortured us with stupid special effects by implying that the evil main character was really into killing his child laborers. Sorry, no sympathy here. And then, just for fun, some guy gets his head chopped off for no real reason, a picture comes to life, a door comes to life, a statue comes to life, Elenor goes crazy -- all not scary -- and then these little kid statues say, &quot;Help me! Help me!&quot; Then somehow, someone becomes the great grand-daughter of the evil guy and she proceeds to not get out of the way when he slams into her, causing severe internal bleeding. Finally, the movie ends and the two people who didn't die WALK out of the main gates, seeming to forget that they had driven there. Anyone who let this movie fool them into believing that it was good has never read the book and is probably way too into special effects for their own good. Even the actors couldn't save this. Stick with the book. For being written in the &quot;olden days&quot; it still has more horror than this movie could ever produce.",

The all-star cast is completely wasted, except for Lili Taylor, who practically does a one-woman show - co-starring more with the house and special effects than with her flesh-and-blood co-stars - though that is through no fault of her own. The script is shallow and trite, and doesn't allow any of the other characters to be more than the most meagre set-dressing. The story is childishly simplistic, and the almost non-stop computer-generated rollercoaster \"horror\" ride that comprises the last half hour wouldn't scare Scooby Doo in Disneyland. The concluding line - \"It's all about the family!\" - is genuinely one of the worst unintended howlers in cinema history.Even without Shirley Jackson's novel or the original 1963 Robert Wise classic to compare it to, this version of The Haunting is just embarrassing. Save your money, and read Jackson's novel or watch Wise's film, instead.",

The lack of subtly is the undoing of this film. The only thing that the film gets right is in the area of casting with Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson nicely capturing what makes their characters tick.Sometimes what we don't see is much scary than what we DO see.The DVD looks fine--the transfer is a bit dated though and would benefit from a sharper, high def transfer. The featurette on the making of the film gives us a good idea as to what the director, cast and writer wanted to achieve but it fails to provide us much information as to WHY they did't achieve it although I suspect it is because de Bont had no understanding of what made Robert Wise's film work so well--the creepy psychological tension.Perhaps modern film fans will scoff at the original which hints at Theo being a lesbian and the fact that Nell is as haunted as the house itself witout any overwhelming \"horrific\" gore but there's something to be said for creating a mood vs. showing us every single bit of gore or CGI as most modern horror flicks do.",

The film moves slow in the beginning, and it starts to pick the pace soon after, and later has it's intense ending. The film is OK in some ways, but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win, but it still isn't horrible. I liked the house and the setting, though. That was cool.

Stop comparing to the book and the masterwork 1963 adaption and look at this film. Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and the guy that played Luke all bring in wonderful performances, even if they lack the character developement that shined in the original movie. The Hill House set creates a substantial amount of suspense and fear, and the script is great, even if it has almost nothing to do with its source material. This is a very suspensful, fluid horror movie that is never boring, always exciting, and moderately scary. The standout is Lili Taylor, who brings a lot to Eleanor and the hysteria that she endures as Hill House tries to claim her. Mrs. Dudley the housekeeper sets the mood nicely, and the computer generated ending is actually not as stupid as the one in the HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL remake, which I heartily recommend. So don't compare this film to other movies, and enjoy a wonderful treatment of a horror movie from Hollywood. Great score by legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith.",

    "review/text": "I LOVE this movie!! I saw it in the theater at least three times and now own it on DVD. It may not have the pure psychological chills of the original B&W; version, but it is plenty scary--far scarier than, say, the pathetic joke that was \"The Blair Witch Project\", which was released at the same time.If you like a bunch of gratuitous gore, look elsewhere. This movie has real class, and an excellent cast. Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes brief performances set up the piece perfectly. One of my favorite early scenes is where Eleanor (Lili Taylor) echoes Mrs. Dudley's warnings about no one coming near the house after dark (when Mrs. Dudley is creepily explaining the situation to Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones).The other characters are excellent as well: Liam Neeson plays the jaded and ethically challenged Dr. David Marrow to a T. His blase' and unbelieving attitude towards the terror the others feel early on makes it that much more terrifying--and satisfying--when the house reaches out to get him. You know it's going to happen, and when it does I, at least, felt like: \"it's about time he got a taste of his own medicine!\"Theo's free spirit is a perfect conterpoint to Eleanor's repressed and sheltered character. In the early scenes where the two are exploring the amazing house it is clear that this is the most fun Eleanor has had in decades. Owen Wilson comes across with a gentle cockiness--a sweet, humorous young man who tries to show bravado in the face of the growing terror--sort of an \"I'll protect you, little lady (even though I'm as scared as you are)\" attitude.Most critics would say the true star of the movie is the house itself--and the special effects that make it move and attack. Indeed, the set is incredible, the effects are fantastic, but the movie would be nothing without the varied personalities of the actors.Perhaps the most chilling scene is Eleanor's vision in the mirrored carousel room, when Eleanor's mirror doublegives her an absolutely creepy smile.For all of the effort the others go to to protect Eleanor, it is she who proves to be the strongest and the bravest--a nice twist when the hero's of most movies are men.All in all, a terrific \"Class A\" movie that can be watched again and again and never get any less spooky.",

    "review/text": "As a former newspaper film reviewer I'm amazed that so many professional critics have panned this film with such relentless severity. Sure enough, `The Haunting' is not masterpiece but it's no failure either. The film is spooky and hectic, creepy and fun; the way Hollywood ghost films should be.Many critics seem to point to the original `The Haunting' and compare its perceived merits to this opus. I saw the earlier version at a spooky midnight premier back in the Sixties and disliked its monochrome dreariness, its overwrought central performance by Julie Harris and the cerebral intensity of Robert Wise's plodding direction. The novel was brilliant; that film was inept. Forget comparisons. Book and film can never match each other when it comes to tingling the spine. The closest success has been `The Innocence' based on Henry James's `The Turn of the Screw.' But that had a Dalton Trumbo screenplay and Jack Clayton behind the camera so that's another story.Back to the present. `The Haunting' has great production values. Hill House is `played' by Harlaxton Manor in Lincolnshire, England and the magnificent interiors where shot on a California sound stage on some of the finest sets I've viewed. They have to be seen to be believed. `The Haunting' is not immersed in special effects but when they come they are very acceptable and quite scary at times. No chill down the spine scary but rather head under a cushion thrills. And the sound effects are superb. Listen and thrill.The acting? Good, bad, indifferent and silly. I'll let you decide who merits those adjectives. The screenplay is effective but perhaps it's best to put aside Shirley Jackson's rending of the yarn as this film unfolds. It's takes a few too many wrong turns and ends up with a plot twist that's downright foolish. Never mind. The trip that far made me forgive all that hysterical nonsense at the end.`The Haunting' is directed with assurance by Jan De Bont who did `Twister' and `The Chase.' A man who knows about fun movies. And, unlike so many contemporary Hollywood movies, this one benefits by being silly. And noisy and fun. It's lovely to look at and delightful to know. You'll watch `The Haunting' more than once.The DVD had language choices and a bonus feature with one of the stars - Catherine Zeta Jones - talking about goolies and ghosties and the making the film. It's all very interesting.I highly recommend `The Haunting' and if I was back in the review business I'd give it an unhesitating four out of five stars. Just to annoy the other buttock clenched critics who condemned it. It actually deserves three. `The Haunting' is great fun.",

There are also sound effects in this version AND now we get to see the spirits of the children and the evil Hugh Crane. CGI makes this possible as we see ghostly children outlined in curtains, weird morphed reflections, and a Hill House that literally comes alive and undergoes threatening distortions.I've watched this film several times since it arrived and have not been bored by it. Liam Nielsen portrays the deceptive scientist well and Catherine Zeta Jones is perfect in the part originally played by Claire Bloom.If you like spook house films, you will not be disappointed by this effort.",

    "review/text": "A group of people are invited to spend a night in a very imposing castle as part of a group experiment not knowing that the real purpose is far more sinister. Apparently, the house has summoned one of the female guests because she is somehow linked to the house's evil history and she must protect the child ghosts inhabiting the premises from the evil poltergeist who abused them in life and continues to do so in the after life.If you're heavily impressed by expensive CGI effects, \"The Haunting\" may be the movie for you. If you're wanting a good old fashioned ghost story with thrills, chills and logic you may want to stay away from this over-worked mess of a horror tale. I had approached \"The Haunting\" with high expectations. After all, it was billed as a chilling excursion into the unknown and several articles published before the film's release boasted about the elabortate special effects.I would like to first state that I personally think CGI effects are over-rated and over-used. This is specially true in horror movies. I have yet to see a CGI infested horror film that has been able to convince me that what I am seeing on screen is real. It all looks \"cartoon-ish\" and despite the expensive digital images displayed, it looks one dimensional and flat. It may be impressive as a video game but as a horror film it's unconvincing. Many of today's younger audience who have grown up with today's more elaborate and technical FX may not agree with my assessment but I know that many others do. Many of the scenes that were intended to produce chills ending up inspiring laughter instead. There is nothing ghostly about this film. Ghosts are suppose to move objects, break a few windows and say \"BOO!\" on occasion. All these ghosts do is possess statues. And what's with the purple hands poking out of the ceiling?Another aspect of the film that I find grating is the lousy script. I usually don't watch horror movies for Oscar calibre script-writing but since \"The Haunting\" takes itself seriously I have to judge it accordingly. The main character is constantly running around the house yelling \"I won't let you harm a child\"...\"The children need me\" ..yada yada yada. What harm can possibly be done to these kids? They're all dead! Why do they need protecting?The main reason I find this film so irritating is because it could have been so much better. It had all the potential. It had an impressive cast (Laim Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson), a great budget, a great musical score by Jerry Goldsmith and the location is splendid. The castle has got to be the most elaborate setting ever for a ghost story. But none were utilized to their full potential. The reason this film escapes the dreaded 1 star rating is because despite the film's cheesiness it still entertains.This banal CGI spectacle is recommended to undiscriminating horror fans under the age of 12. All others, you might want to think twice or look elsewhere. Aside from a few laughs, you will find nothing more than a mindless hodge-podge of computer trickery. The original film, \"Poltergeist\", \"The Shining\" and \"The Changeling\" are far better. You might want to give those films a try before you commit 90 minutes of your life to this.",

    "review/text": "The new version of &quot;The Haunting&quot; is an overblown hodgepodge which doesn't do justice to the original novel. It's obvious the makers of this film went for the sensationalism route via the use of technology: the special effects were mostly unneccesary, and, for the most part badly conceived; (the set was too brighty ornate to be creepy!) The acting in this movie is mostly embarassingly bad (the ludicrous script was partly to blame)-but Liam Neeson seemed to be really completely lost. Catherine Zeta-Jones was good as the beautiful Theo, but Lilli's interpretation of Eleanor was tiresome and inane. Jackson's story, &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; is known by thousands as a psychological study of loneliness and madness; it ain't about using millions of dollars worth of &quot;special effects&quot; to bring the masses in, so the movie will reap finacial rewards from the producer's personal gain. Phoney and contrived, with banal elements which weren't in the book, this film is an insult to fans of the genre, and I just hope Shirley Jackson isn't rolling in her grave!",

    "review/text": "Fans of Shirley Jackson's classic novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; will remember that the story had a genuine frisson quality to it, as did the 1963 film starring Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. Those of you who are expecting an improvement in either are going to be sorely disappointed (as I was) in this laughable re-make. The gargantuan set was overly done and the producers obviously wasted an AWESOME amount of money on mostly meaningless special effects which, I suspect were meant to give the picture &quot;shock value&quot; Liam Neeson gives a lifeless and uninspired performance and Luke Sanderson is ridiculousy portrayed by Owen Wilson. I like Lilli Taylor and think she's a decent actress, but her playing of Eleanor was not effective, the fault of which lies mainly in the stupidly written script which makes the audience laugh in all the wrong places. There was no &quot;Great-Grandmother&quot; in the original story at all and this makes the film ludicrous as does the insinuation that Hugh Crain is beezlebub himself-he was responsible in the torturing souls of God knows HOW many children?-Implausible and utterly unconvincing, this movie is a sad ,sorry filmization of a potentially terrifying story (it could have been more truly chilling on a quarter of the budget!) Grotesquely overblown, poorly acted and written, the movie leaves ASOLUTELY NOTHING to the imagination which any ten-year old knows is where real creepiness begins. Catherine Zeta-Jones's beauty was the BEST thing in the whole show. Shirley Jackson's masterpiece deserves better, more THOUGHT OUT treatment than this hodgepodge;it would help to follow the original story-these new Hollywoodisms STINK! .",

    "review/text": "I'm not really going to compare this to the older version-doing that just makes comparisons, and that makes for a less enjoyable viewing experience if you have pre-envisioned ideas. See this on its own merits. You'll be happier, trust me.The story is about Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson), a scientist who wishes to conduct a psychological experiment about fear, so he lures three subjects to an old house with the pretense of staging a sleeping-disorder experiment. This is a fairly hollow excuse to have the house be haunted, but it is an excuse, and it does work, so who cares?As far as acting goes, Neeson is in the 'good' range. He's not great, but he does pull off his role fairly well. He has to be fairly sympathetic and genial, which he pulls off very well. He also needs to be sinister enough to confuse the audience. This is where Neeson stumbles a little bit. Now, the three 'subjects' are played by Lilli Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson. Taylor does a respectable and competent job fleshing out her sensitive, put-upon character Eleanor. At times she seems silly, but usually manages to pull off her character's melodrama. Zeta-Jones is equally capable as the openly bi-sexual, extroverted Theo. She manages to pull her character off slightly better than Taylor at points. The real stand-out is Owen Wilson, as the cynical joker Luke. His role is a supporting one, but he does a great job.The special effects are very good: they are a bit overblown later on, but the subtle effects are very amazing as we see the many manifestations of the villainous ghost of the owner of Hill House. The sets are a show-stopper. They are very beautiful and exquisite: a high point.The Haunting is an awesome movie. Rent or buy it tonight!",

    "review/summary": "horrendous remake",
    "review/text": "Recently, Entertainment Weekly published a list of the &quot;25 Scariest Movies of All Time&quot;, compiled by the employees of the magazine. Clustered atop the list were the usual horror film suspects, fine films all: &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Halloween&quot;. Perhaps predictably, absent from the Top 25 were the horror films of yesteryear, particularly four films from what I consider to be the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of horror. For in an amazing four year span, 1960-1963, a quartet of films, each released in a different year, emerged to lift the genre to heights it has not been able to reach again. In 1960 came the great British sci-fi thriller, &quot;Village of the Damned&quot;; in 1961, there was Jack Clayton's brilliant ghost story, &quot;The Innocents&quot;; then, in 1962 came the piece de resistance, what, for me, is the greatest horror film of all time, Herk Harvey's low budget masterpiece of eeriness, &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;; finally, in 1963, Robert Wise directed the classic haunted house spectacular, &quot;The Haunting&quot;, based on Shirley Jackson's novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;. Each of these films share, in addition to their effective use of black-and-white photography and haunting musical scores, an appreciation of the power of suggestion, their realization that true terror lies in the imagination and that a creepy mood counts for more than inane gruesomeness and heavy handed special effects that just end up detracting from the horror. (I would include &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; on my list except that it was released in 1968).Now, with the new version of &quot;The Haunting&quot;, each of these films has been subjected to the indignity of a modern day remake. Jan De Bont's version is a travesty on so many levels that it's hard to know where to begin, but each of its many failures stems from a basic problem of modern commercial moviemaking: wretched excess. The first element that makes it inferior to the original is one that probably can't be avoided in this day and age; the simple fact that black-and-white is far more effective a medium in establishing the kind of eerie atmosphere necessary for this type of tale. In color, the picture is simply too clean and bright and one loses the sense of danger hidden in the shadowy corridors and corners of the house. And the house itself creates a problem. For although the art direction is a true miracle of design and decor, it actually detracts from the suspenseful ambience the film so desperately wants to achieve. Even Hill House has to be realized on a scale of some believability. In the original film, the rooms looked as if someone might one day have actually lived in them. Here, the setting is so preposterously ornate that the house looks more like a museum or grand fun house than a center of ghostly activity.The film fails far more dismally on the level of its screenplay. In the original story and film, the parallels between past and present that connected Eleanor, the protagonist, to Hill House were worked out with such a fine logic that they helped hold the plot together. For instance, an earlier inhabitant of the house was a bed-ridden invalid who had to be looked after just as Eleanor had looked after her ailing mother. Also, the car crash that kills Eleanor in the original is presage by a carriage accident which kills one of the earlier inhabitants and which begins the curse that befalls this house that, as the originals claim, was &quot;born bad&quot;. In the remake, the house has no logical reason for choosing Eleanor so the plotting degenerates into arbitrary silliness. Indeed, part of the fun of the original was the atmosphere of anticipation that came from knowing this house had a reputation for evil and the slowly dawning realization that it was searching for a new victim. In the new film, this is never established and, in fact, the characters aren't gathered to hunt for ghosts at all, but have been lulled there by a researcher, ostensibly to help them cope with their insomnia, but actually to function as guinea pigs in a study of the effects of fear on the personality. Yet, this is inexplicable because the doctor has nothing to do with the ghostly phenomena and, in fact, doesn't believe in its existence, so, by what method was this fear to be manifested? This is typical of the illogic that permeates the film. And, surprisingly, in these more permissive times, all the sexual tension between the doctor and Eleanor is completely eliminated from this version.The ultimate indignity comes in the film's appalling final half hour when any attempt to replicate the subtlety of the original film is abandoned in favor of overblown special effects and lines like &quot;Hugh Crane, I'm not afraid of you!&quot;. By this time, the audience has erupted into bursts of incredulous laughter and Hollywood has succeeded in trashing yet another of its classic films.",

I guess it's not appropriate for an adult to admit being frightened or even entertained by a haunted house flick, but in my opinion this is the most beautiful and stylized piece of filmmaking since Dario Argento's \"Suspiria\".The characters are fun and the performances solid. Catherine Zeta-Jones is stunning, Lili Taylor is sweet as honey and Owen Wilson is fabulous as always. But it's obvious that there is one character in this show that is more important than the others. A character that literally, both physically and mentally, overshadows the rest of the cast. That character is Hill House - the most elaborate scary place ever filmed, a gigantic haunted house with one hell of a personality.There is a dreamlike atmosphere in this film unlike all others, and I must say that I like it. Similarities to \"Poltergeist\" abound, and there are some clumsy script passages here and there, but on the whole it delivers the promised goodies. \"The Haunting\" keeps well within the boundaries of its PG-13 Rating. Absolutely no nudity, swearing or graphic violence is seen or heard anywhere, but it doesn't diminish the film in any way. This is striking stuff even without it, and the film strictly follows the rules of the genre, with thunder and lightning, squeaking doors, paintings that come alive and spooky caretakers.The picture quality is high with only some grain and digital artifacts. Most impressing on the technical side is the sound, with awesome bass and bottom to it, destined to wreck more than a few loudspeakers in the DVD-community. The Bonus Material section of this disc contains a Behind-the-Scenes Feature, two theatrical trailers, Production Notes and Biographies.I recommend this DVD for all you esthetics out there. Those of you who are looking for a strong and believable story, on the other hand, may want to pass here.I'm sure glad I didn't...",

This movie version of Jackson's brilliant novel &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; is infinitely inferior to the 1963 version starring Julie Harris. Overblown and badly acted, this movie has one ludicrous script and the set, which is meant to be impressive, misses the intentions of the original story. Liam Neeson is totally out of his realm in this hodgepodge - Lilli Taylor would have made a great Eleanor if it weren't for the banalities of the script and the ludicrous additions to the story: the children, her Great-Grandmother, making eccentric Hugh Crain into Lucifer personified, etc. The original novel has a lot to recommend it and these fabricated aspects definitely are not among them. Catherine Zeta-Jones makes a visually arresting Theo,and she's really the only character in the film which comes alive and rings true. Owen Wilson's interpretation of Luke Sanderson comes off as just plain stupid and Neeson seems completely lost. Shirley Jackson fans around the world are sorely dissappointed in the misinterpretation of her work and this film which is basically a waste of money, talent and the viewers time!",

I got past the flaws in the movie, and picked out the parts I liked which do outweigh the parts I didn't.I usually like the more suspenseful horror films where you're left guessing is this a supernatural act or someONE's doing? This movie started off that way, but quickly went into the CGI stuff which took the guess work out it. But if you accept the ghost plot the movie can be enjoyable. The graphics are pretty good, and you can actually feel for the lead character, Nell. The rest of 'em.....eh.The best part of all is the eeriness and beauty of the house, which I guess could be considered the lead character, it's worth checking out the film just to see the house! One thing I did notice though is that after a couple of viewings even though the house on the outside seems to go on forever, you get familiar with the sets for the inside of the house and notice the movie takes place in only about 6 different rooms that they just keep showing over and over again. Wish we could have seen more!Anyway, if you have a bit of extra cash to burn check this out, and remember second time might the charm!",

    "review/text": "I went into this movie expecting to see an screen adaptation of Shirley Jackson's &quot;The Haunting of Hill House.&quot; However, aside from the names of most of the characters being the same (Why the gratuitous name change from Dr. Montague to Dr. Marrow? Too many syllables?), the movie has little in common with the novel. None of the relationships between the characters are the same, and Luke is no longer the heir to Hill House, but just another guy who can't sleep well. The novel had a dreamlike quality to it; there was delicacy and subtlety. There was also a sense of closeness among the four characters, setting up base in the parlor of the huge Hill House, that was lost in the film.There is a saying that you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. In the novel, the house seduces Eleanor, and one of the more memorable scenes is her elated dance through the house, having been accepted by it, merged with it, able to hear and sense the happenings in most every room. That was far more creepy and eerie than the usual &quot;house bullies occupants&quot; device used here.I guess I'm rambling a bit. The point is: it is the screenwriter's job, when adapting a novel, to externalize interior action so that we can see it. I think that Mr. Self did a good job of this with the initial scene with Nell and her sister. But there is a responsibility to retain the spirit of the original story, even if scenes must be added or removed. &quot;The Haunting&quot; fails on that count. Framing the visit to the house as a deception on the part of the doctor eliminates the closeness that the characters have to each other in the novel. The other, more significant, deviations from the original plot serve to make the story more conventional and destroy the unanswered questions and unexplored locations (e.g., top of the library tower) that make the novel so effective.On the positive side, the set design and special effects are great, the actors do a good job of working with what was given to them, and the DVD quality is very good. The DVD contains a behind-the-scenes feature that is interesting, though it makes me feel bad that so many people put in so much hard work making a visually exciting movie based on a weak script that has no respect for the source material.As other reviewers have said, this movie would have been much better off if it had not been conceived and advertised as &quot;The Haunting of Hill House.&quot; That creates expectations that the movie just doesn't live up to (and the faithful screen adaptation that was done in the 60's doesn't help here).In summary, worth seeing at least once for the special effects and, if you've read the book, as an example of how far a supposed adaptation can deviate from its source material.",

I realize many young people are awed by the special effects and the humongous set,and the sound and visual qualities which they see on the DVD, but this film is not faithful to the original, excellent story and it could have been MUCH better. For the most part, the script was ludicrous and the newly added elements such as Eleanor being related to Hugh Crain's wife were totally ridiculous and hardly neccesary. The original Hugh Crain was simply an eccentric, sadly embittered man, NOT a MONSTER! Catherine Zeta-Jones is a statuesque beauty and she served Theo well, but she and Eleanor didn't interact nearly enough. Lilli's personality was right for Eleanor for the most part, but it was that PUTRID script which prevented her from making Eleanor Jackson's Eleanor. Liam was all wrong as his version of Dr. Montague and Owen Wilson's interpretation of Luke was a joke (literally). Ornate and expensive though the set may have been, it did NOT capture the intended creepy atmosphere so important to the story (it was TOO much! ). I thought the idea of the guests being invited to do a survey on insomnia was clever and original however; it's what happens afterwards which misfired! If you TRULY liked this movie and you would like to see the version which was in keeping with the book, rent the 1963 version of THE HAUNTING with Julie Harris (SHE was Eleanor!)Although not a perfect movie by any means, it basically captured Jackson's subtle intentions and it lingers in the memory MUCH longer than a string of lousy special effects!

    "review/summary": "The fake detective. But THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!",
    "review/text": "This series was produced by Sheldon Reynolds and filmed in France apparently for an American TV audience of 1954-1955. \"Holmes\" is portrayed by Ronald Howard (son of Leslie Howard), completely out of character from the more classical renditions, decidedly not intellectually convincing. Howard Marion Crawford portrays Watson who, in one of the few negative pluses in this series, is not the boob depicted by Nigel Bruce and drives most of these episodes. Lestrade is somewhat credibly portrayed by Archie Duncan.The complete Sherlock Holmes repertoire has almost 60 episodes, 38 or so filmed with Jeremy Brett, still leaving a substantial number unfilmed. Don't look to this series to fill any gaps. This reviewer has nothing against faked (not Doyle-created) Sherlock Holmes plots if the story is good. In this case, there are 20 episodes (of an original 39 in this series) which the cover blurb assures us are \"loyal to the great Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories.\" Well, if you think these are Doyle-created or inspired or \"loyal\" episodes, on even a remotely intellectual par with the original works or some of the TV adaptations of the last 20 or so years, there's a bridge here this reviewer would like to sell you. Only one of these, \"Red-headed League\" is Doyle's, the basic plot intact except for deficiencies discussed below. The other 19 are stereotyped caricatures having no relationship whatever to any of Doyle's original stories.What comes to mind as one watches these episodes is crude burlesque. There is no regard for real mystery or quality content. Everything is mock thrills and cheap \"entertainment.\" The \"acting\" is one-dimensional and grotesquely over-done (and one step removed from evil villains twirling their mustaches and going \"heh-heh\"). Typically, in \"Eiffel Tower\" precious minutes disappear showing can-can girls dancing and to hell with \"plot\" or explanations. After all, THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! One stinker, \"Texas Cowgirl\", comes complete with stereotyped \"cowgirl;\" and insultingly \"inscrutable Injun chief\" complete with feather bonnet and war paint, squatting in front of a teepee in a hotel room, not \"savvying\" English, smoking peace pipe and saying \"HOW\".Just as one begins to feel one of these charades is maybe of better quality than the rest, Reynolds & Co. uncork a buffoonish ending with the characters hamming it up foolishly with lots of heartwarming feel-good corn, playing to a dumbed-down audience with limited attention-span. But you know what American commercial TV does to just about anything and there's no exception here: a classic example of what still drives such television even today.By today's standards, the DVD picture and sound are crude. There are occasional lapses, likely by chance, into sporadic good footage from the morass of bad material. Overall these 50-year-old materials show no evidence of re-mastering or cleanup. The black and white image can be very dark in low light scenes when definition is almost totally lost! There are frequent speckles, splotches, jumps, light-level fluctuations, flickers, some hairs or fibers on the lens, something briefly hanging down in front of the camera at one point, and the like. Sound quavers and varies in loudness. The only saving grace (some might say that's no plus) is volume of material for the price (20 episodes at 25 minutes per for a total of 500 minutes). Arthur Conan Doyle certainly had nothing to do with this.",

She shows how yoga is about more than just flexibility -- it's about really making the most of each moment and living your dreams. And YFS II really helps you do that.At about 45 minutes, the program can be done at one time, or I prefer to do the three main sections at different times. The first part, \"Spinal warm-up\" is great to do in the morning to get energized. Then the \"vinyasa flow\" is more rigorous and helps build coordination and quick reflexes. That aspect has really helped my surfing. Then the \"balance and relaxation\" is good for the evenings. Peggy's relaxation sequences are so good -- soothing and just the right blend of imagery and visualization.The music is just perfect -- not the usual bland stuff of most yoga videos, but really engaging and uplifting. And the settings are gorgeous and the surfing is so inspiring.I have never seen an exercise video made with such high quality. Every detail is in place.

This portion moves fast, barely a full breathe per pose except for the first time a new pose is done but only tiny bit longer. This is almost power yoga speed. Mountain & standing fwd bend is practically non-existant when they are suppose to be done. Added poses are chair, crescent, lunge, warrior 1, warrior 2, triangle, side angle, half moon, side plank/star. Non-vinysa is hero's & standing fwd bend to relax & stretch.Balance & Relaxation: 11 minHere there are no more sun salutations, but mountain in between. Tree, swaying palm (same pose & slight bend to torso), flying warrior/warrior 3, crow, reclined knees to chest, modifed boat, boat, bridge, knees to chest, reclined leg split, single leg to chest, reclined spinal twist, reclined butterfly, savasana (both lying down & sitting indian style 3 min)Bonus: Increasing lung capacity: 11 minBreath of fire - sitting up indian style for over a min w/hand mudra & reclined with knees to chest & head lifted toward knees for over another minute or legs & head barely raised off the ground for advanced to strengthen core muscles.Ujjayi breathing/Darth Vadar breath - slow breathing to the count of 4 w/hand mudrasBreath Retention - lengthen inhale/exhale from count of 4 for each, to count of 10 eachThe music was either too low to hear or else you'd suddenly hear a looped fast Spanish guitar playing which wasn't relaxing. The poses are nice as always, her voice seems nice enough, she uses good cues, though this is not good for a first or 2nd yoga dvd because of the speed & no time for proper teaching. She rarely tells you when to breath in or out. She uses both anatomical terms & spiritual yoga terms such as where to have your intention to get the most of your energy. The pace was just too fast for me & I didn't feel a mind/body connection.Previews: totalvid com shows the ending of the warm up when she holds poses for a while & youtube com shows the beginning/middle of the warm-up.",

Even for non-surfers this is a great practice to connection with the earth, ocean, and air. I am not a burn and sweat \"Power Yoga\" lover, but I liked this practice, as it was not too fast.Peggy starts out with a spinal warm-up rather than \"powering\" right into the vinyasa flow. The vinyasa flow is very presented beautifully and with just enough instruction. With each cycle she add on one additional pose. The only thing I would like different is that she doesn't give enough time between each cycle at mountain pose to make the mind/body connection.My favorite part of the practice is the balancing session. She includes a nice challenging balance flow. Then a final relaxation with stretches and twists ends the practice. She walks you through a visualization of sitting on the beach that is beautifully presented and energizing.As a bonus you get an Increase Lung Capacity practice that includes mudras/meditation and is explained clearly and pleasantly. She includes some Kundalini Yoga in this DVD with Breath of Fire and other breathing exercises and practice.I have the Director's Cut DVD, which costs a little more. I'm not sure the difference between this 2002 release verses the 2004 release. Mine includes some blooper clips, which are fun, fun, fun. Also, this yoga practice doesn't end dramatically with advertising or load obnoxious music like many DVDs; it ends with beautiful music where you can continue your mediation.",

I've improved my strength and endurance, and Peggy's instruction makes it easy for me to stay inspired and encouraged. The balance poses are hard but I can see my improvement bit by bit. The music (like the first DVD)is really beautiful and adds to the overall experience. Best of all is Peggy's teaching which is clear and \"normal\" -- not too much talking but enough to keep you motivated.

I surf, swim and work out 4 times a week and consider myself in good condition. I can't really say this video has improved my surfing or flexibility, however, it is fun, the music works well with it is well organized. I just think some of the vinyasa flow poses should be held just a little bit longer. With the four count inhale, exhale breathing, this cannot be maintained with the quickly changing poses. Overall I still enjoy doing the video a couple times a week. I am going to try and compliment this video with a hatha style yoga for more extended poses and stretching.

I don't think you burn a ton of calories, but you do stretch a lot which is very helpful if you have backpain. I use the DVD's as a supplement to working out if I do not have time or feel like adding something extra to the day's workout plan. It only takes about 45 minutes, of which 25 is more workout based and the rest is stretching.

    "review/text": "The Sinful Dwarf is an exploitation/horror film from 1973. The fact is, if you're looking for a masterpiece of cinema...You're looking in the wrong place. The review on the cover says it all; \"The mother of all dwarfsploitation films! Over the top with nudity, sex, and disturbing images. It just doesn't get any sleazier, folks.\" This is a perfect example of truth in advertising, because The Sinful Dwarf is a sleazy movie-going experience...But if you don't mind the experience of watching a film about a psychotic dwarf and his even crazier mother, then you could do worse than this.Torben Bille plays the dwarf, Olaf who assists his mother Lila Lashe with running their rooming house. In the opening scene, we see Olaf lead a girl to the attic of this house before knocking her unconscious. The room in the attic holds several girls, all naked and addicted to heroin, who Lila sells as sex slaves to various people. A young writer named Peter moves into a room with his beautiful wife Mary (Anna Sparrow), who grows suspicious about what exactly is going on in the attic.But, enough about the plot...This film is 90 minutes long and as can be expected from an exploitation film, it has prolonged, gratuitous sex scenes and lots of nudity. As I said, there are girls locked in the attic that are naked. There's no shortage of anything sexual here.I'm no aficionado on exploitation films, but I didn't expect much from this film. I watched it more out of morbid curiosity than anything else. The fact is The Sinful Dwarf is a fascinating little exercise in the exploitation genre. It's campy, a little bit creepy, and entertaining in its own strange way. This is a film that not only has two antagonist's, one a dwarf and another a deranged woman prone to prolonged dancing sequences...But, there's an overweight heroin dealer who sports an afro and goes by the name Santa Claus. It doesn't stop there; there's a scene where a girl is whipped where we never see the whip making contact with skin and after cutting back to the girl we see poorly applied red makeup to her body. The film's score sounds like a mix between horror film and porn music. The sets and overall look of the film had the potential to be creepy, but everything else is pure camp...And that's fine.As for Olaf, he bares a passing resemblance to Jack Black and he is creepy, just never in a scary way. And there's plenty of him here to satisfy those `dwarfsploitation' fans. If you don't like The Sinful Dwarf, I doubt you knew what you were getting into beforehand. If you're curious about this movie, I recommend it...If it looks like something you'd enjoy, you likely will. It's an amusing, campy exploitation flick that is surprisingly better than you'd expect.GRADE: B",

    "review/text": "From grindhouse and sleaze-meister Harry Novak, and out of the deepest recesses of the 70's came - \"Dvrgen\" (\"The Sinful Dwarf\") AKA \"Das Haus der verlorenen M&auml;dchen\" 1973, and directed by Vidal Raski. Three minutes into the film, we knew this was going to be one sick ride! 'Olaf' (Torben Bille) had a penchant for young innocent girls (who were also naive enough to fall for the charms of a devilish looking dwarf with wind up toys!), as he lured them to follow him home to become unwitting sex slaves! Oh, and his pleasant mother 'Lila' (Clara Keller) actually encouraged this behaviour since it brought in additional income. When a young unsuspecting couple 'Mary' and 'Peter' (Anne Sparrow and Tony Eades) suddenly showed up looking for a room to let, Olaf obligingly agreed (when a dwarf jumps on the bed in the room you're looking to rent and says in a Danish accent..\"you see...it is a nice soft bed\" and lets off a sinister cackle. Maybe it's not a good idea and politely you would say thanks, but no thanks!!) and took them upstairs. Did I mention that mother 'Lila' (not to be confused with 'Lola'), appeared to be a washed-up cabaret performer (she definitely did not play the 'Blue Angel') and had an inclination to dress up and sing after her drinking sessions! This flick is pretty sick and sleazy, but believe it or not it's done in such a campy and looney way that you will actually find yourself laughing along with cuddly Olaf and his dear mother!!! I won't give anymore away. This is the triple xxx version (the film elements do not match, but they do not appear to be inserts), so there was more than just poor naked gals! The actress that played Mary (Anne Sparrow) was actually pretty good, and she definitely had a lovely figure! But its really 'Olaf' and 'Lila' that stole the show here, we even got a quick glimpse at 'Lila's' disfigured body (just kidding, actually the old dame was in pretty good shape. I would have wanted to see more of her with singing of course!!) she did have a scar along her left cheek (on her face, do pay attention)! This was an American-Danish co-production, and as I've written so many times before, only in the 70's could they have gotten away with a barbaric and sadistic piece of work like this one ( but of course plenty of enthusiasts like myself already knew that) it's pretty bad. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars, the pacing was slow and unfortunately the production-values here were very low ($10,000.00 more from uncle Harry, could have raised the bar!) not the best lighting or camera work. The DVD picture quality by 'Private Screenings X' was pretty good, but could have been better! English (no subtitles) NTSC, NR 96 mins.Love and Peace,Carlos Romero",

A sort of modern take on Greek tragedy. The film also features Verdi's \"Force of Destiny\" as its theme tune.As with \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" by Rappeneau, the director here had a great story and great cast (Yves Montand shining through). One uncharitably wonders what little he had to do in terms of creativity in such an ideal situation for any director to be in.All in all, this is a great piece of French film making. Highly recommended to anybody who loves good film, but especially for those whose idea of France does not go beyond Paris city boundary or \"Freedom Fries\". You will have some idea about the French farmers by the end of this film.By way of postscript, I believe this was Beart's film debut and she is unbelievably beautiful in this, which somewhat disturbs the film as a whole.

    "review/text": "MANON OF THE SPRING completes the story that began in JEAN DE FLORETTE. It is not a sequel; it is the second half of a single tale. Although the first film can be watched independently of the first, neither really stands completely on its own.The second film takes place several years after the first, and centers on two of the characters from the first film--Le Papet played by Yves Montand and Ugolin played by Daniel Auteuil--as well as a young girl who is now living on the land upon which Jean de Florette lived in the first. The girl named Manon and played by the exquisitely beautiful Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, turns out to be the daughter of Jean de Florette. Ugolin, observing her, falls hopelessly in love with us, yearning for her in a manner so desperate and passionate that you sense immediately the impossibility of its being fulfilled. The film deals with her resolve to wreck her revenge on those responsible for the death of her father.What she doesn't realize is the possibility of an even more potent revenge that lies beyond her control, but which arises near the end of the film. The two films are great without the last half hour of the film, but it is the last half hour that makes the two-film sequence a truly magnificent masterpiece. We find near the end revelations that make the story that the two films tell almost impossibly tragic. I can say no more than this without giving away key elements of the plot.The two films are both quite superb in the picture they paint of rural France. The idyllic beauty of the countryside belies the hidden blackness in the hearts of many of the characters. Yves Montand's character, especially, displays the karma attaching to a petty, mean-spirited viciousness. If the first film belonged to G&eacute;rard Depardieu, the second one, and as it were retrospectively both films, to Yves Montand. Although Montand made a few more films before his death, this was far and away the greatest thing he did in his last years, and in a way stands as the last great achievement in a grand career. I'm not certain he was ever better than in the last half hour of this great film.I cannot urge strongly enough for anyone who loves movies to see these two films. Even those who do not normally enjoy foreign films with love these. The story told is too grand, and the performances too stellar, not to adore them.",

Like a greek tragedy, the events slowly but surely unfold, and even the characters who we have come to despise become tragic and sympathetic by the film's conclusion. Rarely can there be found a film of this dramatic power. Easily one of the best French films of the 1980's!",

Yet the movie works on many levels: on one, it is like a complex detective story, with tiny clues sprinkled throughout gradually coming together at an overwhelming ending. On one level, it is a comedy, poking fun at pompous scientists and ignorant folk. On another, it explores unrequited love, a topic the movies usually avoid. On another it about the lush scenery and quaint village life in France. Yves Montand is a brilliant actor. He packs so much depth into every second he is on screen. He feels like a real person. It is a movie about faces, memorable, complex, elderly, even ugly faces.This movie is the very opposite of fluff.",

    "review/text": "This film finishes the story that was begun in \"Jean de Florette.\" Ten years ago, Cesar (Yves Montand) and his nephew Ugolin plugged up the spring on Jean's farm, causing him to lose his crops and die in a tragic accident. They then bought his land, reopened the spring, and became successful flower growers.Manon was just a child when her father died, and is now a beautiful young woman, living alone in the hills with her goats. Ugolin falls hopelessly in love with Manon on first sight, and Cesar, desperate for his family name to go on, encourages his nephew to court her. She, however, despises them both after learning they inadvertently caused her father's death. She takes her revenge, Ugolin takes a pitiful step, and, too late, Cesar learns a heartbreaking secret.This very moving story has been compared to a Greek tragedy; it shows the pain of unrequited love, the power of vengeance, and the irony of fate. Yves Montand is wonderful as the greedy, clever, and lonely Cesar. I recommend seeing \"Jean de Florette\" first, and then you can enjoy the story's surprising and touching resolution.Kona",

Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, \"accidental\" murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime. My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision. Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.",

Humanity at its very worst is blatantly reinforced with seemingly no devil to pay for even the most dire of moral transgressions.Part two, however, sees the most evil of deeds repaid in spades. No film encompasses the play of emotions as do these two films.

    "review/text": "Manon, the daughter of Jean de Florette returns to Provence and lives in a small cottage on the property of her father. In the previous film, her father had died trying to make the farm work but discovered without a source of water, it was impossible. The farmhouse and certain lands were sold at decreased value to the neighbor Cesar Soubeyran. He finds a mysterious supply source for water which had eluded her father.Soubeyran's nephew, Ugolin Gallette secretly falls in love with Manon as she wanders the hillsides Provence tending her flock of goats. Manon however pays little attention to him while she keeps a keen distant eye on a newcomer, the teacher in the town who walks among the hills, examines the soil and takes a high interest in local developments. A mysterious chemistry develops between them. Meanwhile Ugolin becomes uncharacteristically ill and after being prodded he confesses to being in love. Cesar gives him advice on how to impress his heart's desire but Ugolin botches the attempts.After Manon tries to save a goat which falls from the hillside to the rocks below, she discovers a cave and cavern, which are the original source of the spring. She develops suspicions about the cause of her father's death. She deliberately stops up the water supply which eventually affects the whole town. At a townhall meeting set up specifically to meet the farmers' need for water, a government official manages to add further insult to injury. The official produces survey records which indicate there is no spring on the land. Meanwhile, the local priest was apprised of the true cause of Jean de Florette's death. In his sermon the priest admonishes the community that G-d may be punishing them for their sins. Accusations fly of who and what caused the spring to dry up. Religious devotees partake in a ceremony after which the water supply is restored. In effect, a miracle has occurred! Cesar Soubeyran suffers a sad, unexpected devastating blow associated with his nephew. During a visit to the cemetery, Cesar reminisces about his past with a blind woman sitting next to him on a bench. She supplies him with crucial details which become the final nail in his emotional coffin. The details become an unanticiapted revenge, one from beyond the grave. This film is deeply satisfying in its portrayal of local culture, greed, outstanding characters and the ultimate surprise ending. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",

    "review/text": "Please see this film in conjunction with Jean de Florette, which pictures the tragedy of Manon's father unjustly stripped of his inherited farm by a covetous poor farmer who wishes to take it and grow chrysanthemums upon it, and so stops up the hidden spring with a rock.The nude scene mentions comes after this vile character steals the land for nothing when it is abandoned due to driness, when he releases the spring, and Manon, now grown sneaks back onto her former family property to bathe in the previously unknown spring. THen the vile character covets her as well.This story of the first film, Jean de Florette, runs as inevitable Grecian tragedy building on the prideful ignorance of Jean, the main character. He does not know of the spring which was blocked and concealed by the neighbor who desires not only his land to grow chrysthanthemums upon, but one day when she blooms, his daughter Manon. With the conspiracy of friends, this covetous neighbor blocks the spring which would bring life and fertility to the farm. Jean tries everything including tragically dynamite to bring the waters to flow with abundant life.When all is too late we discover unknown family ties which would have made Jean not a rejected outsider intruding upon and rejected by this enclosed and impoverished mountain farming community but embraced as a lost son. The inevitable development and tragedy of these two films together is as stately as as horrifying as a trilogy of ancient Greek plays, as profound and as universal. Watch them carefully and rivers of understanding will wash you with renewed humanity.",

    "review/text": "Manon des Sources (1986) is the screen rendition of Part 2 of Marcel Pagnol's exquisite novel, L'eau des Collines (1963). It is the continuation of the story of Jean de Florette, concerning two competing projects, one carried-out by the city-dweller Jean Cadoret, and the other by the peasant Ugolin, set in the rustic and picturesque environment of Provence in the 1920sManon des Sources owes its success to Pagnol's particularly intelligent scenario. Taken verbatim from his novel of the same name, it was flawlessly adapted by Claude Berry and Gerard Brach, whose work consisted mainly in translating into images this impeccable scenario.As stated in my review of Jean de Florette, a good story must have a plot, a compelling conflict, and characters that we care about who change as a result of their experiences. This particular story qualifies unquestionably as a good one, on all these points.In Manon des Sources, the second chapter of his novel, Marcel Pagnol uses the same approach in his story that he did in Jean de Florette, posing questions and providing answers in a more or less convoluted, drawn-out way, the better to keep the viewer's suspense high.The first and most important question in this chapter concerns the soothing of our bad conscience following the less than satisfying conclusion of the preceding film. We feel perturbed for having resigned ourselves to accepting the outcome, the success of Ugolin's project, which we never totally rejected, at the expense of Jean's project, which we by now wish had succeeded. How will Pagnol liberate us from this disturbing feeling? We already know that he is not interested in introducing a Deus ex machina to discharge our anxiety. He will again proceed objectively, relying on the psychology of the different characters involved.The second question concerns the two new characters appearing on the scene: a grown- up Manon and Bernard Olivier, the school teacher. We hope that they will be the ones to provide us with a more satisfying resolution to the first chapter. But what is done is done, and the only liberation from our sense of guilt must be a plain, straightforward type of revenge on Ugolin and C&eacute;sar for their crime. Will it be sweet and innocent Manon, or will Bernard offer a solution?When the perfidy of Cesar and Ugolin is finally exposed, our conscience is partially appeased by Ugolin's suicide. But Cesar's retribution will be more terrible yet, in what is one of the most dramatic endings of any film I have ever seen. Eventually, it is not certain that we applaud this ending either, as no matter how devious Ugolin and Cesar were, we cannot totally erase the positive feelings they and their project inspired in us at the beginning of the first film.For the interpretation of the three leading roles, film director Claude Berry chose three exceptional actors, each with a unique personality and film presence. In the role of Cesar we could not have imagined anyone other than Yves Montand, native of Marseille, a fabulous actor with more than sixty films on his resume, cabaret singer, and at one time candidate for France's presidency. This aging character of Cesar, cantankerous at times, a happy strapping fellow at other times, a sensitive and vulnerable human being, is Montand himself, and vice-versa. Gerard Depardieu is outstanding in his role of Jean, being both somewhat arrogant and, at the same time, poetic. As for Daniel Auteuil's performance, his attainment of the well-deserved Cesar for best actor in 1987 for these two films, says it all. Finally, Emmanuelle Beart, who also won a Cesar for best supporting actress in 1987, fills the role of Manon with grace.There are two additional brilliant \"actors\" in the films. First, there is the picturesque and harsh landscape of Provence. From the first minute of Jean de Florette until the end of Manon des Sources, we are seduced by the gorgeous images of the Provence countryside, and certainly by the love the director shows for Pagnol's work and the atmosphere it evokes. The second \"actor\" is the village itself, as portrayed through the different village characters, shown as little vignettes scattered throughout the films. All these characters bring much authenticity to the story.The themes of this film are the same as those for Jean de Florette: city versus the country, modern versus traditional, good versus bad, and memory versus oblivion.Pagnol's message is humanistic in so far as, without ridicule or Manichaeism, he presents the motivations and different points of view of each of his characters.On the same humanistic level, the story demonstrates that not withstanding apparent differences, such as social, regional or physical, all people are alike and deserve to be treated humanely. However, in that respect, Pagnol's philosophy is a little naive. The reconciliation of the villagers with their past wrongdoing toward Jean Cadoret, symbolized by the marriage of Manon, occurs only when they understand that Jean was actually \"one of them.\" So the community of humans beyond differences that Pagnol proposes as an ideal only exists here because Jean \"belonged\" to the village. As such, according to Pagnol, the village life is idyllic, but for the eventual presence of harmful individuals such as Ugolin and Cesar.In spite of Pagnol's naive idealism, the films still succeed, because we are ultimately able to tie up all the loose ends, and to reconcile the warring factions through family and blood ties that transcend any geography.",

    "review/text": "Released within a year of each other, \"Jean de Florette\" and \"Manon des Sources\" (aka \"Manon of the Spring\") are often viewed and reviewed separately, but the truth is that they're integral parts of a single story which needs to be seen in sequence for its full impact to be revealed.Set in the 1920's, both explore the stark realities of the tough existence and myopic intrigue that was an integral part of life in the Luberon's stunningly pretty countryside & villages before the march of time transformed them into \"must see\" tourist destinations. Beautifully filmed and meticulously crafted, their brilliantly effective evocation of the realities of this now lost and very different world elevates each into the category of truly outstanding cinema - visual feasts that re-create what life was really like, good and bad, in what we now see as an \"idyllic\" time.And, as entertainment? Well, \"Jean de Florette\" wins in terms of having the stronger and most obvious \"plot\", enhanced by Gerard Depardieu's tremendous performance as a man seeking to realise his vision in the face of insurmountable odds. But that is, as \"Manon des Sources\" reveals, only half the story, for beneath the tragedy of \"Jean de Florette\" is a much more tragic sequence of events. Slower, more reflective and, in the end, deeply moving, \"Manon des Sources\" is not simply a \"follow-up\" but the key to understanding the full story on offer.Individually each \"works\" and, as such, stands in its own right as an excellent film, but it is only when seen together that their true power is revealed. You really do need to see both...",

    "review/text": "This film is the continuation of Jean De Florette and deals with the grown daughter's(Emmanuelle Beart) revenge on the unsuspecting farmers who deceived her father. This continuation develops the original plot further. The deceitful farmers played by Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil soon realize that they've deceived themselves as much as the innocent Jean de Florette. The theme is a complex study of human nature and is somewhat akin to Caine's dilemma, 'Am I not my brother's keeper?'The cinematography and script are excellent but I was rather disappointed in Emmanuelle Beart's performance. She's the weakest actor in this film and, because she's unfortunately also the central character, her inept skills have a significant impact on the film altogether. Her acting is forced and the emotions she attempts to express don't leave a very strong impression. Other than that, the story is great with an impeccable supporting cast.",

    "review/text": "I love this film. Emmanuelle Beart made her debut in this film and she is breathtakingly beautiful. Her husband Daniel Auteuil also starred in the film. I don't know if they met on the set or not but it was certainly made at the beginning of their careers in film.The story of Manon (Beart) continues in this film. In JEAN DE FLORETTE she was a little girl, who accompanied her parents to Provence where her father took up the cultivation of Carnations on the old family farm. Uncle (Yves Montand) and cousin (Daniel Auteuil) next door objected as there was only enough water to supply one farm. The result was a water war.In MANON, the young Manon has grown into a young woman. She lives a relatively wild life on the old homestead, raising goats who follow her everywhere like children. Cousin (Auteuil) realizes one day that he is in love with her. But a dark secret hangs over his head and if Manon knew the secret she might hate him (has to do with water).The rest of the plot consists of the resolution of problems, tensions, difficulties set up in JEAN DE FLORETTE. I can't imagine anyone buying one film and not the other. I am buying both DVDs. They are a set. The cinematography is wonderful, the actors are superb. If you love Provence you will want to own these DVDs so you can watch them on those cold rainy days when you aren't in France.",

(In the Inferno, those who suffer, suffer in accordance with the &quot;sins&quot; that brought them to hell. For instance, Count Ugolino's story of his starvation and the starvation of his children at the hands of Ruggieri. Ugolino gnaws perpetually on the nape of Ruggieri's neck: Ruggieri starved Ugolino and his sons so he is eaten by Ugolino eternally.)The author, Marcel Pognol, grew up in Provence where the story is set and has essentially created a classic greek tragedy in Catholic Provence. It is a beautiful, haunting story. You will watch it numerous time. One of the best films ever made. The two part series may be better than Babette's Feast.",

    "review/text": "\"Manon of the Spring,\" (1986), a French drama, is a sequel of sorts, and a tale of revenge. It's also a mouth-watering, award-winning color film, set apparently, in the early 20th century, in Provence, in the gorgeous, fertile south of France. With its prequel,Jean De Florette, -- well, actually, it's not so much a prequel and sequel, it's more just a direct continuation of the story -- it tells a bittersweet tale of life among the peasantry of the time. It is based on a novel, with which I am not familiar, by Marcel Pagnol, with whose work, I regret, I am also not familiar, tho I believe he was a screenwriter of note; was adapted for the screen and directed by Claude Berri.You can watch \"Manon\" without seeing \"Jean de Florette\" first, but I don't know why you'd want to. At any rate, the movie picks up the story of the locally-prominent Soubeyran family, who have been scheming for their own advancement, with little consideration for others. Cesar Soubeyran, known as \"Le Papet\" locally, is the wealthy, almost last survivor of a dynasty of hard-working, successful peasants, and treated with great respect in his village. As played by the magnetic, older Yves Montand, (The Wages Of Fear - (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray];Diabolique (The Criterion Collection) Spine #35)), he is as hard a man as his long life has made him. Then, his possibly not all there nephew Ugolin, played by Daniel Auteil, always so successful at playing not particularly bright characters (The Closet) had come home from his stint in the army. The older man is anxious to see his nephew married, with children, settled locally, and making a living before his illnesses end his life. Accordingly, Cesar has his eye on a plot of land that adjoins his holdings, and several healthy looking girls in the village.But the land the Soubeyran family covets had been inherited by an outsider, a tax collector civil servant; a luckless hunchback played by the magnificent Gerard Depardieu, (Green Card),who had come to the village bearing some regulation outsiders' French name, a wife and young daughter. However, if Jean had been called by the name he should have been in the village, had they known who he really was, he would have been known locally as Jean de Florette, the title character of the first installment. At any rate, the Soubeyrans, Cesar and Ugolin, pretended to befriend and help the naive and generous hunchback, who was inexperienced in farming, but had many ambitious plans, some entirely unsuited for the location. Nevertheless, the Soubeyrons secretly worked against the would-be farmer, most importantly by depriving him of water.Greedy, cruel behavior to be sure, with tragic consequences. We begin \"Manon\" with a glimpse of the title character, the daughter of Jean de Florette., in the person of the beautiful Emmanuelle Beart (Nathalie). After the death of her father, which she believes was caused by the Soubeyrans, she has grown up largely on her own, as her mother has had to seek work elsewhere. Manon is rather an uneducated wild child as a result: she has kept herself alive by being a shepherdess, and hunting small birds for sale. She decides to take revenge against the village that allowed the Soubeyrans to behave as they did, and deprives the village of its water, causing great chaos and consternation. Ugolin is greatly in love with her, but she, of course, will have nothing to do with him: she rather fancies the handsome young local schoolteacher, who is, however, miles above her in the village's social order.The film is moving, powered by the work of its stars, as these characters work out their destinies, and reach a somewhat surprising conclusion: not the one for which Cesar had hoped, but one he can appreciate. \"Manon\" may be thought to have dated a bit, to be a bit too reliant on coincidence. Still, it seems to me grounded in reality. We watch the first telephones and automobiles creep into town, the appearance of new styles of dress. And I believe that French peasants, any peasants really, have historically wanted only certain things: land, with water on it; real gold, not paper scrip, and the success and survival of their families. A memorable piece of film-making that deals with great issues and essential truths in its way, and an enjoyable one, too.",

    "review/text": "Passion should be felt, revenge observed with detached honesty, as within this exceptional film (directed by Claude Berri). Watched Manon of the Spring (Manon des sources) while reading Ovid's Art of Love (Ars Amatoria). My first question was: Are the director and screenwriter treating the themes of love (turned to hate), passion (turned to vengeance), and intimacy (turned to venom) with artistically-inclined disregard (aplenty) or with delicacy (afresh)? These are not themes to be trifled with; some regard for virtue must be maintained for the woman when men have plotted with cunning against her beloved father. Now we come to the major themes at work within this story (based on the novel L'eau des Collines by Marcel Pagnol).Poetic justice must prevail or the intricately-layered crescendo of the storyline will falter and burn without attaining its proper denouement. One asks: Does the heroine (Manon, played exquisitely by Emmanuelle Beart) deserve a romantic treatment as a tragic heroine, who falls from grace and redeems herself in time? or Do we observe a deliberate re-fashioning of the traditional feminine model of virtue, where the woman goes astray because men have driven her to act with subtle resolve. In either case, Manon would be a tragic figure, who deserves our sympathy even as we empathize with her character throughout her deadly planning. Innocence was lost, then regained through poetic justice; that would be the premise.We come again to the stream of vengeance, where some women (perhaps without knowing it) become deadly over time, poco a poco. The tension wire, now real within the plotline, stretches into the heart of the film. We observe Manon's deliberate seduction of her neighbor (the focus of her revenge); she is the shepherd, he is the wolf. Her innocence draws us further into the act (itself); her nudity draws her victim to his eventual death. Through demure seduction, the noose is pulled tighter. Manon's hate, a deep well overflowing with years of plotting, reminds us that once her trap is set, there is no turning back; she has sealed one man's destiny to equal the score. The full cunning (dramatic irony) of our heroine is not exposed until the truth about her father is revealed to Ugolin (played brilliantly by Daniel Auteuil). His suicide completes her act of retribution. Her pregnancy redeems her spirit, like a fresh mountain spring. The stream has now changed from vengeance to the life within her womb. Manon can now grow into maturity; her heart has been set free of malice and hate.",

Both movies should be seen back-to-back to make this story complete and comprehensible. Actually, this really could be called \"Jean de Florette: Part Two.\"\"Manon Of The Spring\" features Emmanuelle Beart, who has to have one of the prettiest faces ever put on film. She plays the now-grown-up woman who gets revenge on the men who ruined her father when she was a little girl.As in the first film, this has interesting characters. The cinematography isn't quite as striking as \"Florette,\" but still decent. There are some neat twists at the end of the story, tying all of it together. The 113-minute film starts slowly for the first third but then picks up nicely to become a memorable story.Remember, you shouldn't watch this film without seeing the other one first.",

    "review/text": "Now a young beauty, Manon sets her self into a quest for revenge against those ones that killed his beloved and charming father, Jean Cadoret. Alone and proud, Manon is a shepherdess running free in the countryside, surviving and avoiding anyone and everyone that dismissed her father for no other sin than just being a foreigner. And so, in one hot summer day, Ugolin falls in love at first sight with the naked beauty of Manon. Chance will turn into the girl's path, to reveal the truth about his father's death, she vows anger and silence into her intentions, and again, chance will provide Manon with the exact and necessary means to revenge her unbearable loss. The whole town will be set into despair, and Papet and Ugolin will find each other in the terrible and cruel ways of the destiny they themselves forge, Cesar will face the dead of his name, and Ugolin, the sadness of a love not meant to be, at the end, they will beg for a miracle, and Manon will find true love inside her quest. Arise.Claude Berri re-prices the landscapes, atmospheres and people from Marcel Pagnol's regarded novel (The Water of the Hill), into a sequel very much worthy of it's predecessor (Jean De Florette), an achievement in it's own right. Bravo.Captivating and honest, Manon of the Spring is pure and true simple revenge, a classical tale of redemption through vengeance, compelling the simplicity and much worth braveness of one single and justified deed, from there to peace of mind. This time Claude Berri paints with the same brush, different emotions in the same protagonist, the slow breaking point of not knowing what else can you do to save yourself, down on your knees, she will only give pardon because of his love, indeed, destiny has the last laugh.Again, the cast enters a passionate and intricate work. Ives Montand, portraits Papet with the same accurate eye, only this time, sadness and sorrow are added to the spectrum, and Papet is revealed in his human ways. The amazing Daniel Auteuil gives despair and tragic sense to Ugolin, the result stands in a emotive evolution of the character. Now, we get to see the little girl that was Manon in Jean De Florette, grown up to be breathtaking beauty, French actress Emmanuelle Beart, portraits the young shepherdess with dedicated understanding of such a bucolic soul, a keen and grooving performance, like a wood nymph (her nude dance scene is an absolute delicatessen), the supporting cast stands firm. The comparison with Jean De Florette hurts a little in Manon's script and in some parts of the direction. The screenplay is actually a fine piece of work, but there are some scenes where the development of important events are carried with some easiness along with a pace that doesn't quite fits the rhythm of the story. This little problem could have been emended in the DVD edition with extra footage, but it seems Claude Berri is quite happy with the original Cut, anyway Manon of the Spring succeeds by an exquisite continuation of a simple but humanly complex story, resulting into a piece of inner strength. Jean Claude-Petit limited himself to re-arrange the same music motifs that appeared in Jean De Florette, nothing more or new.This DVD version has the same audio and visual transferring of Jean De Florette (Widescreen Letterbox Edition 2:35.1, with Dolby Digital 2.0) , a good edition of its feature, again, a new and improved version can do more justice to this beautiful film, but the DVD is good enough to see it without any real problems.So, this is the final chapter of The Water of the Hill story, a portrayal of intolerance and love is what the whole story is about, and little in Cinema History, such topics had been shown with so much conviction, you recollect what you harvested in your own past, and laments have come to late to make a change.",

    "review/text": "Oh this is a beautiful film, shot in Provence, with the absolutely lovely Emmanuelle Beart playing Manon of the title role, and her husband Daniel Auteuil playing the opposing lead. Manon de Florette is the grown daughter of JEAN DE FLORETTE. To follow the storyline and understand Manon's actions, you must see part one of this two-part story.In part two, Manon has become a &quot;shepardess&quot; who lives with her goats on the hillsides in Provence. When we first see her, she garbed in a quaint shepherdess costume Marie Antoinette would have envied, and tinkling through the brushes with her herd. Auteuil, the young cousin of Jean de Florette sees her and realizes he has fallen in love with the adult Manon whom he first met in JEAN DE FLORETTE.One day, owing to someting Manon does, a handsome stranger comes to the village. Auteuil's chances with the beautiful Manon are dimmed by the arrival of this handsome young man who also falls in love with Manon. Beart is so beautiful it's hard to imagine why all the young men in the village aren't in love with her.However, other obstacles exist for Auteuil. I cannot say much more without giving away the storyline, but it has to do with an unresolved issue set up in the first part of the story told in the film JEAN DE FLORETTE. Let's just say it has to do with water, thus the title, MANON OF THE SPRING.JEAN DE FLORETTE and MANON are wonderful films, and although the latter film is the better one, you cannot understand the latter without the former.Storyline aside, if you love Provence, then these films will appeal to you. It is hard not to feel the sunlight on your cheeks and smell the wild Thyme, Fennel, Rosmary and other herbs growing on the hillsides where Manon and her goats wander.",

Like a Greek tragedy, everything falls into place, everything is accounted for as fate conspires with character to bring about retribution for those who did wrong. We feel sad and sorry for Papet and Ugolin, whose weaknesses and \"crimes\" are so like our own.Daniel Auteuil, who plays Ugolin, is a actor with great range and sensitivity. He is unforgettable here as a not-too-bright peasant who suffers an excruciating and hopeless case of unrequited love. And Yves Montand, who plays his uncle is flawless, like an Olivier, as he experiences a very cruel turn of fate. Emmanuelle B&eacute;art, who plays Manon, is very beautiful, but she is also strange enough to be believable in an unlikely role as a solitary shepherdess of the hills of Provence.Claude Berri's direction is so perfectly paced, so full of attention to detail and so unobtrusive and natural that the film just seems to happen without effort. Nothing fancy, just show what needs to be seen, no more. Use no more words than necessary, but all that are necessary. It's almost like magic, how easy it looks. The scene near the end when the blind woman reveals the cruel turn of fate to Papet is exquisite in its simplicity and its effectiveness.In a sense this movie is a throw back an earlier era in cinema when careful attention to the construction of a character-driven story was the essence of the art.",

To truly appreciate it, you must see the first part, Jean De Florette. In that movie, two greedy neighbors trick and cheat Manon's father, who is a kind and generous man, in order to gain his property, but the cost is even higher than they planned, since the deception also leads to his death. In this sequel, his now-grown daughter learns of the plot which caused the loss of her father, and takes revenge on them. Although you depise those greedy neighbors for what they did to that family, they are not portrayed completely as evildoers, rather as humans with their own flaws and failings. So when Manon's revenge results in more tragic consequences, it really makes you think about the cycle of pain and revenge that people perpetrate against one another. The greedy neighbors suffer harshly for their deeds, and although to a certain extent they deserved it, it is also very sad. There is a message here that \"what goes around, comes around\", and \"you reap what you sow\", and that those consequences happen naturally in time, and don't need human intervention to make them happen. This is a movie that will make a permanent impression.",

    "review/text": "Within my top five favourite films at this point, Manon of the Spring is a conventional, brilliantly acted story of lost romantic longing, revenge, redemption, and forgiveness.Daniel Auteuil shines as the physically unattractive Ugolin, smitten with hopeless desire for the wild shepherdess Manon (the heavenly Emmanuelle Beart), daughter of the deceased Jean (from Jean de Florette). Their interaction in this pastoral countryside is priceless, especially if you know the back story, the complicated character dynamic between Manon and Ugolin. Manon's subsequent revenge on the entire town has a tragic air to it, because though you know she's justified in her actions, the townsfolk are portrayed in such intimate detail that you will find yourself drawn to them, sympathizing. Much like the peasants of Seven Samurai, you see their folly, but feel for their distress.Director Claude Berri has the good sense to let the very intense dramatic situations in this story play out in a naturalistic, restrained manner. Instead of bursting out into the proclamatory Jacobean mode, Manon of the Spring lets the tragic moments and points of emotional outburst breathe, instead of drowning them out in tirades of sentimental outburst. The results are simply stunning.I saw this film before I saw its predecessor, Jean de Florette, and the result was a wonderfully different experience. I recommend trying it out as an experiment -- Manon of the Spring stands on its own as an autonomous piece of superb storytelling, but its reverberations change once you've seen Jean de Florette.",

The farmhouse and certain lands were sold at decreased value because of the lack of water. The neighbor Cesar Soubeyran bought the farm and unblocked the spring ...Soubeyran's nephew, Ugolin Gallette, who was part of the conspiracy to drive Jean de Florette from the land falls in love with Manon as he watchers her tend her flock of goats and while she wanders the hillsides of Provence, setting traps for birds that she sells in the market.

The teacher loses his knife which Manon finds ... they meet and she returns the knife which he insists she keep with all its fancy gadgets. A mysterious chemistry develops between them ... Meanwhile Ugolin behaves uncharacteristically claiming to be ill. His Uncle prods and eventually discovers he is in love. Ugolin finally admits with whom. Cesar gives him advice, dress like a hunter, impress Manon, talk to her nicely ... Ugolin botches it up as he stammers out his declaration of love.When a small goat drops from the hillside among the rocks below ... Manon strives to save it. She discovers a cave and cavern which is the source of the water supply for the spring. She works hard to block it up which eventually dries up the water source not only for Ugolin and his precious carnations (cash crop) but for the whole town. It causes an uproar to the point of a government official visiting who promises a large supply of bottled water to solve the needs of the people. It upsets some farmers who want more done stating the spring supply needs to be restored so they can continue to farm and save their crops. The official checks the records and proves there is no spring on the survey maps ... Meanwhile, someone may have confessed to the local priest about the unusual circumstances regarding the death of Jean de Florette associated with the blocked up spring in the past. In his sermon the priest admonishes the community that G-d may be punishing them for their sins ... One farmer accuses Cesar Soubeyran of having caused the problems claiming he saw them block up the spring and heard the discussion with his nephew. Cesar denies it and adamantly claims Jean died of an accident ... After the community prays and the devote partake in a religious ceremony, Manon unblocks the spring with the help of the school teacher. In effect, they brought about the miracle which the religious people had prayed for ... Cesar Soubeyran suffers a sad but not unexpected devasting event involving his nephew. During a visit to the cemetery, a local blind woman sits next to him on a bench and reminicses about the past, particularly his youth when he fell in love with Florette, who left the village and married a blacksmith in another town.

That the two films aren't boxed together is ridiculous, because although they stand alone, taken together they become an unforgettable film experience and a devastating masterpiece.In this film, the little daughter of Jean de Florette, who knows what was done to her father and by whom, has grown to become a stunningly beautiful young woman (Emmanuelle Beart). She is a free spirit, a shephardess, and so achingly gorgeous that one of the participants in her father's tragic downfall (Daniel Auteuil) can't help but fall hopelessly in love with her (no mystery there!). That his love is hopeless and will ruin him is just the begining of the reverberations from the sins commited in the first film that will befall the sinners in this concluding second film.The other is what happens to the character played by Yves Montand. I will not spoil it for you, but what comes back on this cruelly calculating old man is something to behold. Montand capped a wonderful career with his brilliant and nuanced portrayal of this man. The role, which spans both films, is a beautifully deep performance, and you will be surprised by your different emotions about this character. It is a full-range performance, and shouldn't be missed by anyone who loves great acting.Although each film is complete unto itself, it is together that the full artistry and power of the story is experienced. So if you get one, by all means get the other.Directed with care and photographed beautifully in the countryside of Provence, this is a visual and emotional treat. A terrific story of human passions, each is a 4 star film, together they are a 5 star masterpiece.",

These films are simply bursting at the seams with poignant lessons on humanity. One which I admire the most is the tax collector-turned farmer's (Gerard Depardieu) single-minded perseverance to realize his dream. One might argue that he selfishly ignored the well being of his wife and child in pursuing his dream. But I contend that he would not have chosen this path had he thought for one second that his family did not share the same passion. In fact, we observe nothing but unwavering love and support from his wife and child.For you travel lovers out there, is there a better way to immerse yourself in life in a quaint French village without leaving the comfort of your living room? This is one of the reasons I love well-made foreign films. They transport you ever so eloquently to another land and time.Watch these films. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.",

    "review/text": "The gorgeous Emmanuelle B&eacute;art plays Manon of the Spring in this sequel to &quot;Jean de Florette.&quot; She is Jean's daughter who comes to realize who destroyed her father by concealing the spring of water in their property. Their neighbor played by Yves Montand took the land for himself after destroying her father with the cooperation of the man who is now in love with her. Manon thus finds herself being able to avenge the wrong that these men did to her family. This is as universal a theme and plot, featuring deceit, greed, and revenge and the costs they entail, as could possibly be embraced and it is brought as flawlessly and seamlessly to the screen as its predecessor. Even if the movie weren't worth watching, and it is, Beart herself is a feast for the eyes. Both films showcase French filmmaking at its best.",

I had read that in the Korean Edition, there was a scene in the movie that was blurred, when Manon is bathing, and wondered how important that would be to the movie, or my response to the story, and IT IS NOT. The scene where Manon is bathing is like 2 seconds, or less! Now, I have seen both versions and let me tell you that in the unedited version (US Edition) you still dont see much more so why pay 70 dollars for something that is not crucial and you can barely see when you can own the Korean version DVD for half the price?...So my advise is get the Korean DVD, save your money and get yourself another movie instead!

Terrific telling of a complex story of intertwined farming families in rural France in the early part of the 20th century.The acting is mostly of the highest order. Yves Montand, one of the most suave men in history is completely believable as a rough hewn, self-centered farmer, Gerard Depardieu, also cast against type, as a gentle, educated city born man trying to make it as a farmer also is astounding. Almost as good is Daniel Auteuil as Montand's not-very-bright son.Only Emmanuelle Beart, gorgeous though she may be, doesn't quite convince me as the wild woman of the fields. Some of it is performance, some of it is how perfect she looks.The story is wonderful in a Dickensian sort of way, with clues and character elements showing up early, only to pay off three hours later. I love the first part even more, somehow it feels more truly tragic and dense, the 2nd part just a bit too neat by the end. But still a grand, intelligent, great looking entertainment.",

Manon regard&eacute; du Printemps (Manon des sources) en lisant l'Art d'Ovid d'Amour (Ars Amatoria). Ma premi&egrave;re question &eacute;tait : Le directeur et le sc&eacute;nariste traitent-ils les th&egrave;mes d'amour (a tourn&eacute; pour d&eacute;tester), la passion (a tourn&eacute; &agrave; la vengeance), et l'intimit&eacute; (a tourn&eacute; au venin) avec l'indiff&eacute;rence artistiquement-ayant tendance (en profusion) ou avec la d&eacute;licatesse (de nouveau) ? Ceux-ci ne sont pas de th&egrave;me tre badin&eacute;s avec ; quelque &eacute;gard pour la vertu doit tre maintenu pour la femme quand les hommes ont trac&eacute; avec astucieux contre son p&egrave;re bien-aim&eacute;. Maintenant nous venons aux th&egrave;mes majeurs au travail dans cette histoire (fond&eacute; sur le L'eau original de Collines par Marcel Pagnol).La justice po&eacute;tique doit pr&eacute;valoir ou le crescendo de faon complexe-dispos&eacute; en couches du sc&eacute;nario vacillera et brleront sans atteindre son d&eacute;nouement correct. L'un demande : Fait l'h&eacute;rone (Manon, jou&eacute; d'une faon exquise par Emmanuelle Beart) m&eacute;rite un traitement romantique comme une h&eacute;rone tragique, qui tombe de la grce et se rach&egrave;te dans le temps ? ou nous observons qu'un intentionnel refaonne du mod&egrave;le f&eacute;minin traditionnel de vertu, o&ugrave; la femme s'&eacute;gare parce que les hommes l'ont conduite pour agir avec la r&eacute;solution subtile. Dans ou le cas, Manon serait une figure tragique, qui m&eacute;rite notre sympathie mme comme nous nous identifions avec son caract&egrave;re &agrave; travers sa planification mortelle. L'innocence a &eacute;t&eacute; perdue, a &eacute;t&eacute; alors regagn&eacute; par la justice po&eacute;tique ; cela serait la pr&eacute;misse.Nous venons encore au ruisseau de vengeance, o&ugrave; quelques femmes (peut-tre sans le savoir) devient mortel progressivement, poco un poco. Le fil de tension, maintenant vrai dans le plotline, tend dans le coeur du film. Nous observons la s&eacute;duction intentionnelle de Manon de son voisin (le foyer de sa vengeance) ; elle est le berger, il est le loup. Son innocence nous dessine plus dans l'acte (lui-mme) ; sa nudit&eacute; dessine sa victime &agrave; sa mort finale. Par la s&eacute;duction modeste, la corde est tir&eacute;e plus tendu. La haine de Manon, un bien d&eacute;bordant profond&eacute;ment avec les ans de tracer, nous rappelle qu'une fois son pi&egrave;ge est r&eacute;gl&eacute;, il n'y a pas faire demi-tour ; elle a scell&eacute; une destin&eacute;e de l'homme pour &eacute;galer le score. Le plein astucieux (l'ironie dramatique) de notre h&eacute;rone n'est pas expos&eacute; jusqu'&agrave; ce que la v&eacute;rit&eacute; de son p&egrave;re est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;e &agrave; Ugolin (jou&eacute; brillamment par Daniel Auteuil). Son suicide compl&egrave;te son acte de chtiment. Sa grossesse rach&egrave;te son esprit, comme un printemps de montagne frais. Le ruisseau a chang&eacute; maintenant de la vengeance &agrave; la vie dans son ut&eacute;rus. Manon peut grandir maintenant dans l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance ; son coeur a &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;gl&eacute; libre de m&eacute;chancet&eacute; et de haine.",

Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) has fallen madly in love with her, but she repels him and then reveals the secret. He commits suicide. Then it's revealed, though it's no surprise, that Mannon's father was actually the son of Ugolin's uncle Le Papet (Yves Montand). We could figure this out from he beginning of JEAN DE FLORETTE.Again, though, this is a folktale expressed on film and surprises are not important, only the telling is - and that is done excellently. The portent of magic is even introduced when the town's well dries up in a drought; a \"ceremony\" is conducted and the water flows again. The characters are simple and direct and do only what they have to do to further the story. There is evil committed and evil avenged. Hans Christian Andersen or the Grimm Brothers would be proud of this movie. It's a beauty to watch. Definitely worth checking out.",

It's filmed in the Gran Teatro La Fenice, Venice, where La Traviata was premiered on March 6, 1853. (This original opera house was destroyed by fire in 1996 and rebuilt.)In this performance, Edita Gruberova is every inch...La Dame aux camelias...the Grande Dame of the Camellias. Her voice is impeccable and her portrayal of Violetta is that of a passive heroine submitting ladylike to her fate. Just when she has regained her reason to live in the arms of her beloved Alfredo, her life is snuffed out like a candle.No stranger to chronic illness myself, I prefer a more vibrant portrayal of Violetta Valery more like that of Anna Netrebko in the 2005 Salzburg Festival production on DVD. This Violetta lives unstoppably each day and defies fate to strike her down right up to her very last moments.I've always believed that Neil Shicoff was vocally destined for the role of Alfredo Germont. I've seen him portray Alfredo live with more more fire than he shows here. I was struck by how Hoffmann-like this Alfredo is, as though, Shicoff is combining La Traviata with Les Contes d'Hoffmann, in an Alfredo inebriated now just with love but love for yet another woman soon to be lost to him.In a newspaper interview with Neil Shicoff which was published in 1986, I wrote that Neil Shicoff \"has an innate sense of drama and a voice that angels might envy.\" This is very evident here.La Traviata is very dear to my heart as Giuseppe Verdi's finest opera.",

It is satisfactory and, on stage, it was probably excellent. The only thing about it that really bothered me was that Alfredo, his father, and Violetta all looked about the same age and that would not, I think, have been apparent from the audience.However, there are several versions that are considerably better. This version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera, but if you wish to see only one, let it be a different one. There are three that I think are equally good: the version with Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas, the version with Anna Moffo (though it has no subtitles), and a fairly new version with Jose Cura.",

His live music and graceful charms the public since the nineteenth century. Your BDS is recognized even by those who are not in the business. Recorded by the greatest sopranos of the last century, either in audio or video, creates a stigma in today's singers. How to write an opera that has been performed by Bidu Sayao with grace, with dramatic Callas, Tebaldi by gently and skillfully Sutherland. Workhorses of famous singers, La Traviata and intimidating defies all current singer.Edita Gruberova seems not to fear the ghosts of passado.Sua Violet turns into a woman of dubious reputation in the beginning, that is gaining maturity. The watershed in Traviata are the arias, is strano! It strano!, Ah, fors'&egrave; lui che l'anima, Follie! Follie! Delirium vano &egrave; questo e Semper Libera. Transpose those parts masterfully reveals the grandeur of a singer, on the other hand, singing badly indicates that the rest of the opera will be long and painful for the audience. Gruberova past this part with great skill, his mature voice, treble coloraturas easy and perfect fit the requirements of the score. Regular theatrical performance, but the whole work is not even cold. Can the beautiful voice overcome the lack of action thrilling spectator. Reserve the best for last, his Addio, del past is poignant, sad, nostalgic, recalling happier days with the beloved, and showing all the pain of knowing that the end is near.The recording is from 1992, so we saw the evolution of this singer. His video of Manon in 1983 with the Staatsoper until this Traviata shows that the years have been beneficial to his voice. Other singers come in vocal decline with age, it improves. The brightness is not the same youth, but the technique is superb. We have newer versions, such as Lucia di Lammermoor in Tokyo in 1996 and Beatrice di Tenda in 2001 recorded in Zurich, evidence that by this time the singer was still in excellent Czech vocal form.Alfredo Germont is the love interest with Violet. Passionate and naive will live with a loved one without worrying about costs and consequences of taking a relationship. Spoiled kid gets angry with his beloved to let him, thinking that she had returned to partying. Neil Schicoff has the task of representing this guy good life. With scenic reasonable performance and excellent voice he can do the trick. Tenor good treble, clear voice that is characterized as lyrical. We saw better sing, your Hoffman in Scala di Milano in 1998 is impeccable, unfortunately his Alfredo is not the same level.Giorgio Zancanaro is the role of Giorgio Germont. This does not accept the marriage of her son Alfredo with Violet. When static and build your character seriously hard and sensitive. Baritone voice clear and short length, struggling to reach the lower notes. Can you sing well his main aria, \"Di Provenza, il mar, but not enough to be an unforgettable presentation. Other baritones sing this role brilliantly, like Renato Bruson.The governing Carlo Rizzi follows the score with fidelity, and a correct time Italian musicality are your strengths. The orchestra of La Fenice is experienced in Verdi, with good strings and wood.The production of the dvd chose to show the opening the Venice canals leading to the La Fenice theater, ingenious solution that avoids the traditional. Always displays the maestro conducting. The economic scenarios leave the stage clean, do not fall into the trap of the extreme load hall Violet. The period costumes are consistent with the production, beautiful and representative. The leadership void and creativity shown conservative and no innovations. Highlight positive for the second scene of Act II, the chorus and ballet represented well the festive mood of the house of Flora.The sound of the dvd are in good level, but how are the analog matrix are not good enough for the recording of digital matrix. The direction of shooting misses keep the cameras almost always static, failing to show the feature of the singers in the crucial moments.The curiosity of this video is La traviata have its premiere at La Fenice, the site of recording of this DVD. Failure at the premiere and future success. Dvd recommended for those who like the traditional version of opera, without innovations, good voices and performances scenic medians.A popular &oacute;pera de Verdi volta ao seu teatro de estr&eacute;ia.La traviata &eacute; uma das mais populares &oacute;peras de Giuseppe Verdi. Sua m&uacute;sica viva e graciosa encanta o p&uacute;blico desde o s&eacute;culo XIX. Seu Brindisi &eacute; reconhecido at&eacute; por quem no &eacute; do ramo. Gravada pelos maiores sopranos do s&eacute;culo passado, seja em &aacute;udio ou em v&iacute;deo , gera um estigma nas cantoras atuais. Como gravar uma &oacute;pera que j&aacute; foi cantada por Bidu Sayo com graa, por Callas com dramaticidade, por Tebaldi com delicadeza e por Sutherland com maestria. Cavalo de batalha de cantoras c&eacute;lebres , La Traviata intimida e desafia toda cantora atual.Edita Gruberova parece no temer os fantasmas do passado.Sua Violeta se transforma em uma mulher de reputao duvidosa no in&iacute;cio, que vai ganhando maturidade. O divisor de &aacute;guas na Traviata so as &aacute;rias, &Eacute; strano! &Eacute; strano!, Ah, fors'&egrave; lui Che l'anima, Follie! Follie! Del&iacute;rio vano &egrave; questo e Sempre Libera. Transpor esses trechos com maestria revela a grandiosidade de uma cantora, por outro lado, cantar mal indica que o restante da &oacute;pera ser&aacute; longo e doloroso para a plat&eacute;ia. Gruberova passa por essa parte com maestria, sua voz madura, de agudos f&aacute;ceis e coloraturas perfeitas se adapta as exigncias da partitura. Atuao cnica regular,mas o conjunto da obra no chega a ser frio. Consegue com a bela voz suplantar a falta de atuao emocionando o espectador. Reserva o melhor para o final, seu Addio , del passado &eacute; comovente, triste, nost&aacute;lgico , recordando os dias felizes com o amado e, mostrando toda a dor de saber que o fim est&aacute; pr&oacute;ximo.A gravao &eacute; de 1992, vimos assim a evoluo dessa cantora. Sua Manon em v&iacute;deo de 1983 com a Staatsoper at&eacute; essa Traviata mostra que os anos foram ben&eacute;ficos para sua voz . Outras cantoras entram em decadncia vocal com a idade , ela aprimora . O brilho no &eacute; o mesmo da juventude, mas a t&eacute;cnica &eacute; soberba. Temos verses mais recentes, como a Lucia di Lammermoor de T&oacute;quio em 1996 ou a Beatrice di Tenda de 2001 gravada em Zurich, provas que at&eacute; essa data a cantora Tcheca continuava em excelente forma vocal.Alfredo Germont faz o par romntico com Violeta. Apaixonado e ingnuo vai morar com a amada sem se preocupar com despesas e as conseq&uuml;ncias de assumir um relacionamento. Garoto mimado se irrita com a amada por deix&aacute;-lo, pensando que ela voltara a farra. Neil Schicoff tem a incumbncia de representar esse rapaz boa vida. Com atuao cnica razo&aacute;vel e voz excelente ele consegue dar conta do recado. Tenor de bons agudos , voz clara que o caracteriza como l&iacute;rico . J&aacute; o vimos cantar melhor, seu Hoffman no Scala di Milano em 1998 &eacute; impec&aacute;vel, infelizmente seu Alfredo no se encontra no mesmo n&iacute;vel.Giorgio Zancanaro faz o personagem de Giorgio Germont. Esse no aceita a unio de seu filho Alfredo com Violeta. Sempre est&aacute;tico e s&eacute;rio constr&oacute;i seu personagem duro e sens&iacute;vel. Bar&iacute;tono de voz clara e de curta extenso, sofre para atingir as notas mais graves. Consegue cantar bem sua principal &aacute;ria, Di Provenza, il mar, mas no chega a ser uma apresentao inesquec&iacute;vel. Outros bar&iacute;tonos cantam esse papel de maneira brilhante, como Renato Bruson.A regncia de Carlo Rizzi segue a partitura com fidelidade, tempos corretos e uma musicalidade italiana so seus pontos fortes. A orquestra do La Fenice &eacute; experiente em Verdi, com boas cordas e madeiras .A produo do dvd optou por mostrar na abertura os canais de Veneza que levam ao teatro La Fenice, soluo engenhosa que foge do tradicional. Sempre se exibe o maestro regendo. Os cen&aacute;rios econmicos deixam o palco limpo, no caem no erro de carregar ao extremo o salo de Violeta . Os figurinos de &eacute;poca condizem com a produo, bonitos e representativos. A direo nula e sem criatividade se mostra conservadora e sem inovaes. Destaque positivo para a segunda cena do segundo ato, o coro e o bal&eacute; representaram bem o clima festivo da casa de Flora.A imagem e o som do dvd esto em bom n&iacute;vel, mas como so se matriz anal&oacute;gica deixam a desejar para as gravaes de matriz digital. A direo de filmagem peca em manter as cmeras quase sempre est&aacute;ticas, deixando de mostrar a feio dos cantores nos momentos cruciais.A curiosidade desse v&iacute;deo &eacute; La traviata ter sua estr&eacute;ia no La Fenice, local da gravao desse dvd. Fracasso na estr&eacute;ia e sucesso no futuro. Dvd recomendado para quem gosta de verso tradicional de &oacute;pera, sem inovaes, boas vozes e atuaes cnicas medianas.Ali Hassan Ayache",

    "review/text": "Gruberova is inspired in this traditionally staged and beautifully sung Traviata. From the very beginning you know this is going to be something very special: with Rizzi in the pit and Gruberova and Shicoff on the stage in Act 1 singing, acting and conducting are beyond praise. And from there is just gets better and better until the final tragic ending. As much as I raved over Kathleen Battle in the recently released L'elisir, and my comments there are not about to change. But I am simply left without words to describe Gruberova's performance. From piano to forte, her timber is extremely beautiful, very moving and with her acting we are watching a life story not a musical drama. Shicoff is in equal vocal estate and as always is very moving. There is no more sincere an artist than he. His Rudolfo with Cotrubas is equally compelling but that hasn't made it to DVD. That Royal Opera performance still remains languishing in the VHS vaults somewhere.. Zancanaro fills out the noble trio with splendor and vocal drama. Rizzi looks very young but his conducting is magnificent catching all the nuances and making no melody trite or inconsequential. This dvd adds to the growing list of must haves. I don't think the singers here can be overrated, especially Gruberova who is just simply stunning, beautiful, you choose the adjective. Listen, try and buy. Am I the only opera buff who thinks these recordings are worth having? Am I deluded? Nobody is reviewing these treasures. You can certainly own your opinion but let's here it. I can't be the only one impressed with these recently released opera dvds. Happy viewing and listening!",

    "review/text": "Verdi's creative genius must have been running white hot when he composed this lovely poignant masterpiece and not surprisingly it has remained one of the world's favourite operas ever since. However, it requires a sympathetic sensitive approach for any production to do its treasures full justice. This recording of a live performance, in the venue where the opera originally received its premier, certainly meets the challenge! Indeed I found the entire production quite exceptional.Central to this success is Edita Gruberov&aacute;'s outstanding performance. Whether being enchanting and beautiful at her soir&eacute;e in Act 1, or distraught and appealing in Act 2, through to the difficulties of the ending in Act 3, musically, vocally and dramatically she is absolutely superb. Her lovely bright soprano takes on wonderful subtle shades of tone and her controlled pianissimo is at times unbelievable. Hers is no mere role, she is Violetta.Her fellow principles are scarcely less admirable. Arguably Verdi gives the elder Germont some of the best arias in the opera and Giorgio Zancanaro makes the most of these. A commanding presence on stage, his powerful rich baritone provides the perfect foil for the diva, matching her for artistry and depth of feeling. Together in scene one of Act 2, they produce, what is perhaps the highlight of the opera for me. I find myself replaying it time and again, yet still finding some new subtle nuance previously overlooked.Neil Schicoff as Alfredo is also in fine voice, but vocally he may lack a little of the finesse constantly exhibited by his fellow principles. Also, to be really nit picky, I found his tendency to sweat under the lights a tad distracting. That being said, his acting is up there on the same exalted plain as the others.Conductor Carlo Rizzi draws splendid playing from the resident orchestra in nice balance with the vocal lines. He is spacious in the lyrical passages, whilst making the most of Verdi's exciting rhythms to drive the more dramatic passages.Verdi's choruses are always an integral part of his attraction and in this production they will surely not disappoint. Oh yes, and there is a little makeweight in the form of a delightful cameo ballet appearance by Gabrielle Brown in Act 2, scene 2.The atmosphere created by the Teatro la Fenice, together with the simple but well designed sets and colourful costumes are all part of the production's overall charm. As with all such recordings one catches a few extraneous sounds and audience noise, but this never becomes too intrusive; neither is the spontaneous applause after some of the major arias. Indeed one feels like joining in.I am aware that there are several versions of this opera available, but I am not in a position to make comparisons as this is the only one I have experienced. However, I feel it would take the harshest possible critic to find too much at fault with this one. Personally I am really enthusiastic about this DVD. In fact I absolutely love it and if I could award it more than five stars I would not hesitate to do so.",

    "review/text": "I don't remember being this moved by a production of La Traviata in a long time. Are you interested in FEELING the opera in addition to seeing and hearing it? Climb aboard.The three leads are in gorgeous voice, devastatingly dramatic in their respective roles. It took me a little while to warm up to Edita Gruberova's Violetta, but by opera's end I was sold. Her Addio del passato(performed uncut) ranks with the best I've heard, and her physical performance improves over the course of the opera, culminating in a flawless rendition of the character's deterioration, redemption, death, etc. Neil Shicoff might not look the part of Alfredo(he's rather bookish for the ardent loverboy), but his voice is lovely and resounding, and one gets the feeling that if the tenor were blessed with the smoldering looks of a Placido Domingo, he would be much more well known and appreciated. Giorgio Zancanaro is perfect as the elder Germont, making the character more sympathetic than(perhaps) he has a right to be. The final scene is shattering, with both men huddled together, impotently watching Violetta fade out, coming to the realization that they have just been playing roles imposed on them by the society they live in while Violetta is the only real person among them, the only character in the drama who has truly lived, and one gets the impression that these two sad and regretful men feel unworthy to be in the same room with such a soaring free spirit. It's a magnificent bit of acting on the parts of Shicoff and Zancanaro. The fact that Gruberova's Violetta doesn't bear any grudges only reinforces her superiority, and her death is exultant, both vocally and dramatically.The sets are beautiful, somewhat dark, less detailed and opulent than in some productions but no less effective. Carlo Rizzi's conducting is slower than the norm but rarely to the point of being plodding or distracting. There are a couple of cuts in the score, but unfortunately that's a common practice with Traviata unless the conductor is Solti or Levine. In this case, the excisions aren't damaging to the overall performance, just a little annoying.I own two DVDs of La Traviata, this one and the Solti/Gheorghiu production. I'm not going to pick one over the other because both are wonderful. My advice: if you can only buy one Traviata, play a game of eeny meeny miny mo, if not, grab them both.",

This is vastly better than Zeffirelli's (sp?) latest version that features a listless Violetta and a cramped staging. My only critique is that Shicoff (Alfredo) looks rather goofy and unattractive. His voice if fine - just not the kind of man women dream about ...Gruberova makes Sills and Angela G. pale by comparison. Her gowns look like something Garbo would have worn. The sets and ambience (the world's most gorgeous opera house)add a special magic to this fantasy version of one of Verdi's masterpieces.",

I have been listening to and watching performances of La Traviata for approximately 50 years. I'm used to it. But I was amazed at Mr. Shicoff's acting in Act I, and blown away in Act II, Scene 1 (when I had to ask someone to bring on the Kleenex) and, at the end of Scene 2 found myself sobbing.Mr. Shicoff is the ONLY tenor of my 50 years listening who shows any acquaintance whatsoever with the writings of Dumas Pere et Fils. He's not pretty to look at, he doesn't try to eclipse everyone within miles of his stardome - he just recreates Alfredo. And breaks one's heart, for Dumas Fils was a gentleman to his fingertips and had a heart that could break.The only critique I have of this DVD is that Mr. Shicoff's Act II Scene 1 cavatina was cut. With an actor like him, we could have used it. Savored it. If there were more tenors around like him, but there aren't and never will be, this opera could be performed as \"ALFREDO\".Mr. Shicoff is the tenor who should have shared Traviata with Mme Callas.",

Cesari plays the cuckolded Masetto with dignity.Molinari-Pradelli conducts at a proper pace. Actually, the performance sounds as clear as a CD. I didn't notice any cuts.

    "review/text": "Though there are many performances of Don Giovanni on DVD nowadays, this one stands in a league by itself. It will not be to everyone's taste; it is filmed in black and white, and has monaural sound. However, unlike most other film versions, there are no gimmicks or Eurotrash or alterations of the plot or meaning; the settings and costumes are all tasteful, realistic and in their proper period. By today's standards, some of the acting is rather foursquare (particularly by Gencer and Stich-Randall) or hammy (Bruscantini, a wonderfully comic presence in some other filmed operas) -- not that most filmed operas offer anything better. But what counts above all is the singing, and that is on an exalted plane that few other performances have equaled and virtually none surpassed. Mario Petri, little known outside of Italy, is a superlative Don -- suitably handsome, debonair, and seductive in appearance, with a handsome, mellifluous voice as smooth as silk and perfectly produced in all its registers. His finely nuanced interpretation that brings out every aspect of the protagonist's multi-faceted character -- its charm, roguishness, cruelty, and narcissism. Sesto Bruscantini was the premier basso buffo of his day, and unlike the often crude Fernando Corena he lavishes true parlando singing on his turn as a rather hapless Leporello. Luigi Alva was a first-class artist saddled with a second-class voice, but his Don Ottavio here is one of his best achievements on disc, and outshines many rivals. The little-know Renato Cesari is an excellent Masetto, who once again takes care to sing his part rather than engage in bluster, but without slighting characterization. Graziella Sciutti practically owned the role of Zerlina, and employs her bright but sweet soubrette soprano to excellent effect, supplemented by acting that is alternately perky and demure. Teresa Stich-Randall is perhaps a bit of an acquired taste; her voice was one of aristocratic pureness and total technical security, but a bit lacking in warmth and passion; while she dispatches the role of Donna Anna with a vocal accuracy seldom matched by others, her temperament was better suited to roles such as the Countess in Figaro and Eurydice in Gluck's Orfeo. Surprisingly, Leyla Gencer is less of a spitfire Donna Elvira that one would have supposed from her other assumptions of bel canto and Verdi heroines, but her singing is always most able and expressive. The only letdown vocally is the Commendatore of the totally obscure Heinz Borst; his voice is too light in timbre and rather hollow and wobbly in production. Francesco Molinari-Pradelli outscore many putatively more qualified Mozart conductors in leading a performance that is brisk, fluid, and transparent, and yet weighty at key dramatic moments when needed. Overall, one could argue that this should receive only four stars rather than five, due to some of the minor flaws and limitations mentioned here; but I give it five because of how it totally outshines the competition. This set can go alongside the classic 1954 Wilhelm Furtwaengler performance from Salzburg as a historical treasure of an immortal operatic performance.",

I'd never heard of Petri but he is certainly up to the title role; in fact the cast was excellent all around singing-wise. I actually liked Bruscantini's mugging as Leporello, it livened up a pretty static staging (Alva walks very stiffly but handles Ottavio's music perfectly, Gencer constantly puts her hand up as if to shield her eyes).

In fact, some even claim that this is the greatest opera ever composed.This great work has been widely performed and prolificly documented either in sound or in sound and visual. I personally own more than half a dozen DVDs and a dozen of sound recordings of this opera.This 1960 film conducted by Molinari-Pradelli boosts of a well-nigh perfect cast: Mario Petri's Don is in every bit as convincing as Eberhard Waechter in the Giulini recording - dark, suave, luminous and villainly all in one. Perhaps the only one to compare visually as well as vocally with Petri is Cesare Siepi. Sesto Bruscantini protrayed the most 'buffo' Leporello. His vocal as well as acting skills are both of the highest order, and really shines in this role. Of the male cast, another truly outstanding performance comes in Luigi Alva's unlovely Ottavio. Unlovely the character might be, Alva put up a truly daunting show in Ottavio's fiendishly difficult arias. Cesari's Massetto is fuly convincing, if not outright brilliant.One of the most difficult aspect in staging Don Giovanni is to line up three top sopranos. Well, here we have here, three unimpeachably capable sopranos to grace Mozart's score: Teresa Stich-Randall, the American 'Joan Sutherland', delivering a beautiful rendition of Donna Anna and putting up a truly noble front dramatically. She is flanked by Leyla Gencer, another incomparable Donna Elvira in the same ranking as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Lisa Della Casa. The Zerlina is the Giulini choice Graziella Scuitii, who at 1960 was in top charm and vocal capability. Her petty stature and silvery soprano really could not have been bettered in any choice for Zerlina.The picture and sound quality, however, are both historical, and if you are not mindful of these, this DVD really should under no circumstances by overlooked.It is simply impossible to line up such musical talents in one show these days!",

There are many times when the balance is off; and I specifically mean the singers totally drown out the magnificent orchestrations. The singers all make lovely sounds; but, that is one of the problems. They are not vocally or dramatically into their roles with one or two exceptions. The first being Mario Petri. He is always dramatically alert and acts and sings with much beauty and nuance. He is one of those GREAT DONS. Luigi Alva is also a vocal asset and presence. I even like Graziella Scuitti's Zerlina and I have often in the past found her voice too small and fluttery. She sounds, looks and acts wonderful. Leporello and Masetto are also better than just fine. Well this leaves the two ladies. Both Teresa Stich-Randall and Leyla Gencer sing beautifully; but that's just it. Neither is dramatically involved. They just sing and sing wonderfully. There is no fire or anger in their vocal makeup in these performances. \"Non Mi Dir\" is all sung in a lovely modulated tone and there is no variance of that lovely tone. I must admit I have been spoiled by two or three fantastic performances of this GREAT MOZART OPERA.One being Leontyne Price at the MET. She went through every dynamic possible and every emotion possible and unleashed gigantic waves of emotion and gorgeous sound. Then after convincing us she was almost raped she lets out a cry for vengeance for her father's murder at frightening masses of furious sound; yet still rich and focused. She then proceeded to float one beautiful lyric phrase after another for the remainder of the evening! However' before that think of Niagara Falls at full flood. I love Stich-Randall's sound but she is too monochromatic for Donna Anna. I'm a new fan of Leyla Gencer. I generally find her very dramatically involved. I find her Donna Elvira too subdued. She is just too pale a presence when compared to Elizabeth Schwarzkopf. I think I blame this all on the stage director; both, for her and Stich-Randall. The conducting is good but not of the highest inspiration. Again, SAFE! I'll watch again; but, not often.",

    "review/text": "Day of Vengeance is a nasty little film that doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not. A robbery gone bad, and betrayals born of mishap and greed, are the catalysts that set the clock ticking on this pastoral passion play.The passage of time in an idyllic agrarian valley, where harvest festivals and bosom-heavy country girls attract the usual run of B-movie troglodytes and biblical Midway struggles, is as much a character in this tone poem as are the various and tawdry characters who come and go. A general store, a motel, a bar, a storage facility, the deceptive calm of the noon sun on sleepy shade trees, lend a sense of normalcy that beckons human depravity to do its best to dig up the dirt and sow havoc.There's a morally ambiguous sheriff in town, and a couple of deputies whose genes lie somewhere on the genetic map between Tonto and Barney Fife, and a Prodigal Son with no purpose in life other than the pursuit of a storied stash of filthy lucre and a possible hook-up with a milk-fed buxom barkeep who can shoot the balls off a steer without her halter betraying a sweat.Day of Vengeance is Greek myth, a tour of the underworld in the light of day. A river runs through it, Charon collects secrets and storage, Cerberus is wandering the countryside like the rabid dog he is, Romulus and Remus do a vicious cameo, Psyche bides her time and teases Eros into motel reverie, Pan is loose on the set, Zeus and Ida Lupino are looking down from Olympus, and the ultimate conflagration is a spaghetti crescendo worthy of a Leone opera.If there's a Drive-In screen still casting images over a cracked tarmac off your dusty interstate, drop the title in the suggestion box. This movie was made for your second date.P.S. Day of Vengeance(aka Blood Loss)won Best Action Feature at the 2009 Staten Island Film Festival. The new LifeSize Entertainment DVD release includes an entertaining commentary track with the director, screenwriter, and cinematographer, and an excellent featurette on the making of the film and its effect on a small town in Mendocino County, California.",

    "review/text": "Fortunate enough to see an early screening of Day of Vengeance, my buddies and I savored it.Director Isaac Pingree offers the Town of Covelo, California as a rich, dusty, seedy backdrop -- analogous to the Wadi Rum desert in \"Lawrence of Arabia\" in that it serves as a compelling character unto itself.Against that backdrop, Pingree paints scenes like a schizophrenic cinematographic master. At times, he is Monet -- offering deliberate, subtle strokes giving a surficial impression, slowly urging the viewer to connect the dots himself and speculate about what lies beneath. Then, without warning, Pingree is Pollack -- violently splashing scenes upon the screen in what initially seems a haphazard manner, until the pace slows briefly, allowing Pingree's rich and penetrating tale and message to coalesce.Watch it. Closely. Appreciate. \"Day of Vengeance\" is what indie film should be.",

At first, Dana comes across as snobbish and stuffy but, as the show progresses, she warms up a lot. If the other seasons ever become available, I'll definitely buy them.I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys medical dramas about women's issues.",

It is a great show that portrays hope, life, relationships, and emotions in each episode. I am glad that this show is finally releasing on DVD, as we can get to watch the series from the beginning.The story mainly revolves around Dr. Lu Delgado and Dr. Dana Stowe, two women who have nothing in common with each other, except for their passions in the field of work. They work in the Rittenhouse Women's Health Clinic, where they face new challenges, and solve new problems from performing plastic surgery to treating HIV positive patients. This DVD set contains the first 22 episodes of Season 1, which are:01. Pilot02. Preexisting Conditions03. Misconceptions04. Second Look05. Performance Anxiety06. Drug Interactions07. Do No Harm08.

Wednesday Night Fever22. MortalityNot only is this show moving, but you also learn something in each episode. Developed by Whoopi Goldberg and created by Tammy Ader, `Strong Medicine' has won numerous awards. Rosa Blasi (who plays Dr. Lu Delgado) won an Imagen Award for Best Actress in a Drama series. I doubt this DVD set will contain any special features, except for the standard ones like languages, and subtitles, but nevertheless, it is worth buying this DVD just to see the episodes.Being sweet and sour at times, `Strong Medicine' is a wonderful drama that will definitely make you feel better.",

Together, they are an excellent film that I would give 4+ stars.The first film, &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; is really only half a film.This is really a &quot;two disk set&quot; and perhaps financial considerations forced the film maker to split it into two normal length films, instead of one long one.

As one New York critic put it, you get to watch Depardieu haul water in various containers for most of the movie. So, why see it or buy it? Because it is necessary to see this film to appreciate the second part of the story MANON OF THE SPRING.Jean de Florette returns to his home in Provence leaving his life in Paris behind. His wife, an opera singer (who warbles a few convincing notes from time to time) and his young daughter Manon accompany him. Manon is named for the operatic 'Manon' -- but of course. De Florette wishes to resume farming on his old family homestead -- growing carnations for the Paris flower market. His land adjoins that of his Uncle (Yves Montand) and cousin (Daniel Auteuil). But there is a problem. The water available for farming will not support the crops on both farms. So, the inevitable struggle for water begins.I believe the screenplay and direction are by Pagnol, he of MY MOTHER'S HOUSE and MY FATHER'S CASTLE fame. The photography is wonderful, and the shots of De Florette in his garden surrounded by red carnations is beautiful. I bought the DVD because I want the matched pair, and I love MANON OF THE SPRING.",

    "review/text": "After the death of a family member,Gerard Depardieu, who plays a hunchback, father, and all around good guy, moves his family out of the city and to the country. His plan is to live happily in the peacefulness of nature. Unfortunatly, his neighbors plan is to destroy that peacefulness and anything that gets in their way. Unknown to the hunchback, the land that he owns is worth much, due to a natural spring that runs through it. The spring, however, has been blocked up so the land has gone to waste. The neighbors, having found the source of the spring, and realizing the worth of the land, continually divise new methods to try and obtain it. Whether by legaly buying the property or stealing it, they will make sure that the hunchback and his family's life is miserable until they have it. Being the first movie in a two part set, I recommend buying both and watching them back 2 back as they will be most affective that way.",

Terrific telling of a complex story of intertwined farming families in rural France in the early part of the 20th century.The acting is mostly of the highest order. Yves Montand, one of the most suave men in history is completely believable as a rough hewn, self-centered farmer, Gerard Depardieu, also cast against type, as a gentle, educated city born man trying to make it as a farmer also is astounding. Almost as good is Daniel Auteuil as Montand's not-very-bright son.Only Emmanuelle Beart, gorgeous though she may be, doesn't quite convince me as the wild woman of the fields. Some of it is performance, some of it is how perfect she looks.The story is wonderful in a Dickensian sort of way, with clues and character elements showing up early, only to pay off three hours later. I love the first part even more, somehow it feels more truly tragic and dense, the 2nd part just a bit too neat by the end. But still a grand, intelligent, great looking entertainment.",

    "review/text": "\"Jean de Florette,\" (1986), a French drama, is a mouth-watering, award-winning color film, set apparently, in the early 20th century, in Provence, in the gorgeous, fertile south of France. With its sequel,Manon of the Spring(Manon Des Sources) [DVD], it tells a bittersweet tale of life among the peasantry of the time. It is based on a novel, with which I am not familiar, by Marcel Pagnol, with whose work, I regret, I am also not familiar, tho I believe he was a screenwriter of note. It was adapted for the screen and directed by Claude Berri. The original score was written, and performed by Jean-Claude Petit and his orchestra; there are musical snatches throughout of the operaVerdi: La Forza del Destinoby Guiseppi Verdi.Central to the tale are the schemings of Cesar Soubeyran, known as \"Le Papet\" locally, wealthy, almost last survivor of a dynasty of hard-working, successful peasants, and treated with great respect in the village. As played by the magnetic, older Yves Montand, (The Wages Of Fear - (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray];Diabolique (The Criterion Collection) Spine #35)), he is as hard a man as his long life has made him. Then, his possibly not all there nephew Ugolin, played by Daniel Auteil, always so successful at playing not particularly bright characters (The Closet) comes home from his stint in the army. The older man is anxious to see his nephew married, with children, settled locally, and making a living before his illnesses end his life. Accordingly, Cesar has his eye on a plot of land that adjoins his holdings, and several healthy looking girls in the village.But the land the Soubeyran family covets is sold to an outsider, a tax collector civil servant; a luckless hunchback played by the magnificent Gerard Depardieu, ( [Green Card).who comes bearing some regulation outsiders' French name, and a family to support. However, if Jean had been called by the name he should have been in the village, had they known who he really was, he would have been known locally as Jean de Florette, the title character. At any rate, the Soubeyrons, Cesar and Ugolin, pretend to befriend and help the naive and generous hunchback, who is inexperienced in farming, but has many ambitious plans, some of which are entirely unsuited for the location. Nevertheless,the Soubeyrons secretly work against the would-be farmer, most importantly by depriving him of water.Greedy, cruel behavior to be sure, with tragic consequences. The film may be thought to have dated a bit, to be a bit too reliant on coincidence. Still, it seems to me grounded in reality. We watch the first telephones and automobiles creep into town, the appearance of new styles of dress. And I believe that French peasants, any peasants really, have historically wanted only certain things: land, with water on it; real gold, not paper scrip, and the success and survival of their families. The film, which was nominated for a Golden Globe, and won several other awards, is moving, its visual leitmotif, of red carnations, will stick in the mind; and it gains immeasurable power from the outstanding performances of its three stars.",

    "review/text": "Jean de Florette is a moving and poignant story of a city tax collector who recently inherits land and a home for his wife and daughter. He loves nature, has farming knowledge, follows a plan, and exudes a desire to become successful and profitable. What he is unaware is that he is up against an evil landowner Cesar Soubeyran and his nephew, Ugolin, who with greed, scheme and plot to take the land away.The soil is rich, but the supply for water has been plugged by Soubeyran and Ugolin. As Ugolin, the middleman sets up the evil deeds, he watches with interest how de Florette's farming techniques prove successful. He provides assistance, loaning his mule and water to Florette. Impressed, Ugolin tends to show a little more heart than his uncle Soubeyran. Every step is a challenge as Florette manages his plan, addresses struggles, loses the land's water, and yet he still prays for rain. He is driven to the ultimate torment with devastating consequences.The acting by the main actors, Montand, Depardieu and Auteil brings a greater depth to the story of good versus evil. The acting by the three leads is excellent, the costumes perfected to the period, and the scenery is beautiful mountainous countryside. French actors Depardieu and Auteil have starred in comedies, AuteilThe Closetand Depardieu was lead actor in an 80s American film,Green Cardand 1998The Man in the Iron Mask.Based on a novel by Marcel Pagnol, the film was made in 1986 and takes place in France after World War in the village of Providence. The film has won numerous awards. It is followed up by the continuing saga,Manon of the Spring, where 10 years later, de Florette's beautiful daughter is the interest of the man involved in the scheme to destory her father.

    "review/text": "The acting--pick any of the three stars, Yves Montand, Gerard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil--is superb, and the supporting cast excellent. But what makes this and its sequel, Manon des Sources (1986), jewels of the French cinema is the story and the characterizations, which go hand in hand.There is genius in how naturally and almost inevitably the story unfolds. Although I haven't read the novel by Marcel Pagnol, I'm sure he's the genius. And this is not to slight Claude Berri's direction which is invisible and at the same time in total control, so that the film is simply a work of art. The characters are true to themselves, and what they do seems natural because of who they are. Jean Florette (Depardieu) fails because he puts too much faith in science, knowledge and the good will and fairness of his fellow man. (He should have listened to his suspicious wife!) Ugolin (Auteuil), whose selfishness and little guy envy lead him to do the harm that he does, is not a despicable character. We do not hate him the way Manon understandably does. He is a man of weakness who gave into greed. Papet (Montand), believes in the lineage of man, in property, money-all the standard burgher values. He is led to do his dirty deeds because of who he is.What is so, so superior in \"Florette\" compared to most movies is the lack of propaganda, the lack of adherence to some political or philosophic preconception. What shines forth is people living their lives and falling into some very human traps. I am reminded of Balzac and Guy De Maupassant in the depiction of the petit bourgeois life of the French peasantry and attendant psychology.",

    "review/text": "This is the first half of a two-part movie, the second half being MANON OF THE SPRING. One of the things I love about this movie is that you don't really realize what it is about until the very end of the second film. When you reach that point, and all secrets have been revealed, the story that the film tells is seen to be both extraordinarily beautiful and horrifically tragic.The first film is a story of pure rapacious greed that stoops to subterfuge and cruelty to obtain its desires. Yves Montand, in the last great achievement in a remarkable career, plays a grower who covets the water on an adjoining property, and with the help of his subservient relative Daniel Auteuil, they plot to frustrate the attempts of the land's new tenant, a middle-class hunchback named Jean de Florette, played by G&eacute;rard Depardieu, to work the property. Jean, who is goodhearted, generous, and kind, is a firm believer in scientific principles, and hopes to make a success by applying the most up-to-date methods in his efforts. Unbeknownst to him, the spring that was to provide him with most of his water is blocked by his neighbors, and his experiment is doomed to failure, with tragic consequences.The plot of the two films is one of the best I know of in the past several decades, but unfortunately to relate it would be unfair to those who have not seen the film. I'll content myself with saying that the film contains several major surprises, but surprises that are not there simply for the sake of shocking, but fulfill the potential of the story as a whole, and give the film a rich and deep significance.G&eacute;rard Depardieu is extraordinary as the unhappy Jean de Florette, and Yves Montand despicable as Le Papet, the neighbor. Although throughout most of his career known as a sophisticated, debonair, and charismatic leading man, in this film Montand plays completely against type. He is thoroughly convincing as a covetous, petty, and vicious rustic.This film can definitely be seen on its own, apart from MANON OF THE SPRING, but one must remember that doing so will leave many hidden aspects unexplored and resolved. Together, these two movies represent one of the great cinematic experiences of the past couple of decades.",

I loved them as a 17-year old after stumbling across a special broadcast on PBS, and I love them today as a 29-year old recapturing the magic on DVD.It doesn't get any better than this, folks. These films are simply bursting at the seams with poignant lessons on humanity. One which I admire the most is the tax collector-turned farmer's (Gerard Depardieu) single-minded perseverance to realize his dream. One might argue that he selfishly ignored the well being of his wife and child in pursuing his dream. But I contend that he would not have chosen this path had he thought for one second that his family did not share the same passion. In fact, we observe nothing but unwavering love and support from his wife and child.For you travel lovers out there, is there a better way to immerse yourself in life in a quaint French village without leaving the comfort of your living room? This is one of the reasons I love well-made foreign films. They transport you ever so eloquently to another land and time.Watch these films. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.",

The scenery is gorgeous, and the acting splendid. It is a simple tale with simple people, and you have to be willing to get comfortable and spend the time it takes to watch the whole story without getting impatient. It will be worth the wait. It is the tale of French provincial farmers, their mentality. and the intrusion of a city fellow (Depardieu) who has inherited a farm and come to join their ranks. He wants to succeed and has a wonderfully positive outlook about his prospects. They just want to drive him out and have a negative attitude. They get their come-uppance through his daughter in the second film, Manon of the Spring, and the tale comes all the way around. It is one of the top five favorite films that I have ever seen.

    "review/text": "Claude Berri's \"Jean de Florette\" is a simple but sobering film depicting the evils of human nature. The story revolves around a hunchbacked tax collector named Jean de Florette (Gerard Depardieu) who travels to a piece of property he has just inherited. He brings along his wife and young daughter to the countryside and sees endless potential in the long-abandoned farm land that he now owns. Jean dreams of reaping endless profits from the vegetables and rabbits he will raise but all of his plans hinge on finding a fresh water spring that a map indicates is on his land. However, two neighboring farmers (Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil) plot against him and plug the spring to guarantee Jean's ruin. They want him to fail as this will force him to sell the land cheap to them. Time passes and Jean becomes more and more desperate when a drought ravages his crops and kills off his rabbits. He makes one last futile attempt to find the hidden water source that he knows is nearby but tragically meets his doom in the process. American audiences who are familiar with Depardieu only through his comedic work will be surprised at how well he handles himself in a dramatic role. He passionately brings to life his tragic farmer. Montand and Auteuil are equally memorable as the scheming villians who epitomize the less desirable traits of man. They provide the perfect contrast to Depardieu's naive but noble character. However, the one image that will linger in your mind after the film is finished is that of actress Ernestine Mazurowna who plays Manon Cadoret, Jean's daughter. Her performance toward the end of the film when she shifts from being traumatized to developing a revenge-fueled resolve raises the emotional level of the film to a crescendo. Powerful stuff. Don't be scared off by the subtitles - watch this film if you get the opportunity.",

We all have flaws, only different. We're all different.Once again, I love the film, although I loved the book so much more. It was so much more touching than the film had been, although the movie was great! The letters in the book were a lot more touching in the movie, maybe because I can actually see the spelling mistakes Ugolin and Papet makes. I wonder if they have spelling mistakes in the letters on the English version of the book? (I read the French version).",

    "review/summary": "Beautiful, Sad Tale of Rural Provence",
    "review/text": "It's difficult to be a big movie fan in America because most of the movies that get spoon fed to us through the media are American movies, and the vast majority of those--even those that come with good reviews--are predictable, unbelievable, and dull.It is such a great pleasure, therefore, to stumble across a film like this, which is smartly told, wonderful to look at, original, and unpredictable. Needless to say, it is not an American film.The first joy of this film is the cinematography. It takes place in Provence, in the rural, farming area of this region. Between the rolling hills and the flowers and the trees and the ancient-looking farmhouses, it is just lovely to look at. It is a place which seems to draw you in, like a beautiful dream. You find yourself wishing you could be there, to live there, to grow carnations or raise rabbits there, as the characters do. The soundtrack conveys this as well, with the always and ever present sound of bees and crickets and songbirds in the air. It is very evocative, and truly plays a part in the events of the plot as well.For the plot has to do with a man, a city-dweller, who inherits a farm in this area, and with his wife and young daughter, decides to make a go of it. He is, however, frustrated by his neighbor, who secretly covets the farm because of the spring on it he wishes to have for himself. The neighbor blocks up this spring before the city man arrives, in the hopes that he can drive him out for lack of water. This is the story. We watch as the city man relentlessly attempts to survive in this place with its neverending short supply of water, and knowing that the solution to his problems is on his own property. It is a sad, beautiful, heart-breaking tragedy.The acting all around is superb, but that of Depardieu, the city man, is magnificent. His indefatigable, cheerful optimism in the face of adversity is uplifting and infectious, enveloping his wife and child and ultimately ourselves. He refuses to give up: futilely digging wells, walking for miles daily in order to get water from a far away cistern, praying for rain in the darkness, and scheming with his wife to find ways to get money in order to make it for one more month, one more week, one more day. We empathize with him whole-heartedly, able to see, through the magic of cinema, the beauty of the place through his eyes.But alas, he loses. It almost comes as a shock, so used as we are to the typical, tie-up-the-loose-ends, sugar-coated, phony-baloney Hollywood ending. It seems very sad, and unfair, but unfortunately, life is often this way. It is greatly to this film's credit that it treats us as thinking adults, as opposed to childish adolescents on a roller-coaster ride. Very refreshing. By the way, I would disagree with those reviewers who feel it is necessary to see Manon of the Spring in order to appreciate this film. In my opinion, it works perfectly well on its own terms.",

I've watched this several times in the past 15 years and always got involved with it....and it's companion piece, \"Manon of the Spring.\" If given a choice, I prefer the latter movie, only perhaps because this is a frustrating story, seeing a good man get ruined simply for greed.Both stories are well-done.This tragic tale of two greedy people driving a nice man and his family off their land is not only frustrating but sad, especially since their is no happy ending, with the man dying while trying to salvage his property. The second film is years later when the daughter, now grown up, gets revenge.Gerald Depardieu is the nice guy here, the one we all root for while Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil are the greedy jerks. These three are famous French actors who always give their audiences good performances.A big plus in this film is the very nice cinematography, which is why I bought this when it first came out on DVD. This is a fine visual movie, not just good storytelling.",

Beautifully filmed and meticulously crafted, their brilliantly effective evocation of the realities of this now lost and very different world elevates each into the category of truly outstanding cinema - visual feasts that re-create what life was really like, good and bad, in what we now see as an \"idyllic\" time.And, as entertainment? Well, \"Jean de Florette\" wins in terms of having the stronger and most obvious \"plot\", enhanced by Gerard Depardieu's tremendous performance as a man seeking to realise his vision in the face of insurmountable odds. But that is, as \"Manon des Sources\" reveals, only half the story, for beneath the tragedy of \"Jean de Florette\" is a much more tragic sequence of events. Slower, more reflective and, in the end, deeply moving, \"Manon des Sources\" is not simply a \"follow-up\" but the key to understanding the full story on offer.Individually each \"works\" and, as such, stands in its own right as an excellent film, but it is only when seen together that their true power is revealed.

    "review/text": "Jean De Florette takes you into a bucolic environment of hypocrisy and superficial envious interests towards dismissed ones, among green French landscapes of farmer's adversity against any foreigner, an Stigma that means both loneliness and passive psychological aggression, greedy and unwelcoming, micro cells of rejection and unfair judgment. Jean Cadoret comes to take on the land he inherits from his late mother Florette, along with his wife (Aimee Cadoret) and daughter (Manon), Jean initiates a utopia of peace and beauty, contemplation and inner state of grace. Little does he knows the faithful tragedy this countryside means, every effort to overcome is a step closer to despair, poor Manon, such an unnecessary faith, the Hunchback is finally aside their mean intentions.After doing his time in the army, Ugolin comes back to meet his only alive relative, Cesar Soubeyran (Le Papet), with a little red torn plan to become rich, and it is in this moment when Papet sets Ugolin to carry on his will for the sake and perdurability of the Soubeyran strong and respected name, only one obstacle stands in, the necessary land, and most important, an spring overwhelming enough to drank the flowers towards their red adult state, this is Florette's land, now in the hands of his son, the Hunchback, known here as Jean De Florette. And so, Ugolin fakes a friendship with Jean, only to systematically destroy this man's fair dream, Jean Cadoret will die ignoring the existence of the spring that could have turned on his despair into a bliss. Revenge will be at Manon's hands.Directed by the audacious Claude Berri (his directorial credits includes, A Man and a Woman 1966, and Germinal 1993), the film narrates the perils and sorrows of a man and his determination to confront adversity within hope and emotion, cruelty is the other side of an envy worthy of any cold hearted patriarch, and Papet represents the director's composure of the survival instinct. Rhythm and straight sense conveys the images into a poem of loss, Magnificent. A greening accurate scenery, along with an amazing and light photography, makes justice to every countryside frame, it is both exquisite and delicate, perfectly blended into images, a little shining jewel enhanced by an smooth and classical music score by Jean-Claude Petit (including the overture of Giuseppe Verdi's Opera: La Forza del Destino, or The force of Destiny, 1862).The film carries on the strong and near perfect performances of its three huge protagonist, the late Yves Montand, Gerard Depardieu, and Daniel Auteuil. Montand commands all his actor experience and knowledge into a mesmerizing portrait of envy and supremacy, and absolute masterful performance, Depardieu expresses with histrionic sense and candor, all the sweetness and tragic personality of that beautiful character that is Jean De Florette, a brilliant work, and last but not least, Auteuil conveys the slimy ways and contradictory conscience of Ugolin, bringing to screen a versatile view of this man, a much keen and deep superb work. Take into consideration, that these three actors are the best ones of their respective generations, big words to say. The supporting cast also brings artistry and intensiveness to the story. Based on The Water of the Hill, by Marcel Pagnol, the screenplay is one of those very strange occasions when an adaptation is as good as the original text, and the film is the cinematographic equal to the novel.The Region 1 DVD is good, Widescreen Letterbox Edition 2:35.1, with Dolby Digital 2.0. offers a fine choice, but an improve version can make more justice to this great film.Jean De Florette is only half of the story, the second part, Manon of the Spring, continues this unforgettable tale of envy and true introspect of greedy behavior. A real lesson for those ones that don't care for nothing more than their own interests.",

    "review/text": "Jean de Florette (1986) is the screen adaptation of Part 1 of Marcel Pagnol's superb novel, L'eau des Collines (The Water from the Hills, 1963). It is the story of two competing projects, one carried out by the city-dweller Jean Cadoret, and the other by the peasants Ugolin and Cesar Soubeyran, set in the rustic and picturesque environment of Provence in the 1920s. Since I assume that by now everyone is familiar with Pagnol's story, let us briefly examine what makes this story so compelling.A good story must have a plot, a compelling conflict, and characters that we care about who change as a result of their experiences. This particular story qualifies unquestionably as a good one, on all the points. One of the main reasons for its success is the fact that the viewer is kept in suspense, continuously questioning the outcome of the story. We can see that a large part of the scriptwriter's role is to ask questions, and then provide the right answers at the right time. These answers can be partial, ambiguous, even contradictory, in order to reinforce the viewer's suspense and questioning.The first question posed in Jean de Florette concerns the success of Ugolin and Cesar in their \"carnation project.\" Will they succeed in getting the critical water necessary for the cultivation of these flowers? This question interests us because these two characters have been introduced as somewhat likable, worthy of our support. Later on in the film, we have second thoughts about the integrity of Ugolin and Cesar, who now appear to us as violent and deeply unprincipled. However, the positive, first impression made by the two Soubeyrans still persists within us.A second question rises with the arrival of Jean Cadoret. Will his project of raising rabbits, a project directly in conflict with Ugolin's, succeed? Although we may have considered at first Jean as an intruder who comes and upsets Ugolin's plan, we also realize that the dice are loaded in Ugolin's favor, and our sympathy slowly shifts toward Jean. But we still keep a somewhat favorable image of Ugolin and Cesar, still hoping for positive answers to the first two questions that are raised.Pagnol now determines that the progress of the drama toward its conclusion, that is to say the answers to these two questions, will depend on subjective, internal factors, such as the personalities or the stubbornness of the characters, and not on external or providential circumstances.Thus, the new questions now being posed are about the nature of the characters. Can Ugolin carry out his duplicitous game to its conclusion? Will he make a mistake and be discovered, or will he be overcome by a sense of guilt and help Jean by revealing the presence of the spring at \"les Romarins?\" The viewer hopes that in the end Ugolin will give in to his positive instincts. As for Cesar, the spectator knows that he will never abandon Ugolin's project. Yet the viewer has detected something peculiar concerning Cesar's reaction when Florette's departure from the village is mentioned. We therefore suspect that somehow Florette's past relationship with Cesar could bring about a positive change in his behavior. Independently, Jean's character will also dominate the outcome of the story. We wonder if his enthusiasm, boundless optimism, and his erudition will somehow contribute to his failureWe are torn between the two conflicting wishes for the success of two conflicting projects. This is the originality of Jean de Florette and what distinguishes this story from the usual, vulgar Manichaean novels or films.The themes are the city versus the country, modern versus traditional, good versus bad, and memory versus oblivion.Jean, returning to the country to cultivate the \"othentic,\" is an idealist, more or less in the Jean-Jacques Rousseau tradition. He has abandoned the city life to return to his country roots. His knowledge has all been acquired in books. He speaks in the idiom of the bureaucrat that he was. He constantly quotes statistics to guide his project and to convince himself and his listeners how Nature should and will behave. He tackles his project with a definitively modern, scientific approach, having made the proper calculations for his project. Nothing is left to chance: everything is anticipated and calculated.To Ugolin, Cesar, and the villagers, because of his language, education, and culture, Jean is a kind of pedantic usurper colliding with the peaceful, traditional aspects of their village life. They make fun of Jean because his knowledge was acquired in books, not by experience. Their conversations, Cesar's in particular, are peppered with old, colorful sayings and local proverbs. The villagers are isolated from Jean's world by their hills and seldom leave their village. They are attached to the land they have worked for centuries and to their way of life. The peasants use their traditional methods to cultivate their vines, fields, and fruit trees by hand, without the benefit of any machinery.In concluding the first part of his story, Pagnol, by presenting us with Jean's failure, seems to distance himself from the intellectual tradition. However, at the same time, he does not consider the country life as a perfect universe, without conflicts. He illustrates the violence that can result from the peasants' deep attachment to their lands. Pagnol exposes us to the tribal mentality of the villagers against \"foreigners,\" such as the inhabitants of the nearby village of Crespin. Finally, Pagnol shows us the deep motivation of Ugolin and Cesar that is also easily understood by a city-dweller: making money.",

    "review/text": "\"Jean de Florette\" is a classic French film about the tragic consequences of greed and envy. Jean (Gerard Depardieu) leaves his job in the city and brings his wife and little daughter, Manon, to live on the farm he has just inherited. He does not know that there is an excellent spring on his land, but his neighbor Cesar (Yves Montand) and his nephew Ugolin know, and they want it for themselves. They plug up the spring, planning to force Jean to sell the property (to them). Jean is an idealist and joyously begins raising rabbits and planting vegetables with the help of his trusty manuals, but there is no rain and the crops will die if something is not done.The story unfolds at a leisurely pace, allowing plenty of time to get to know loving Jean, unscrupulous Cesar, and simple Ugolin. The pace of village life is slow and the land is hard; the scheme to drive Jean away gradually gets more sinister. The three lead actors are all excellent and so convincing you'll be mesmerized. The photography is quite lovely. The ending may come as a surprise if you don't know that this is part one of two films; the second, \"Manon of the Spring,\" continues the story.Kona",

    "review/text": "I have a general rule when it comes to Gerard Depardieu, if he's playing sexy then pass but if he's playing a character then keep.Depardieu is the title character in Jean de Florette. Jean has inherited his mother's family farm. He is bringing his wife and young daughter Magnon. Jean did not grow up in the area so even though it is his family farm, he is an outsider.To further complicate things, he has a slight hunchback, which the villagers take as a curse.Caesar (Yves Montand), the farmer next door and his nephew (Daniel Auteuil) would like to buy the land and expand their holdings.But Jean looks at this as a chance to build a new life and refuses. Therefore Caesar plots to force Jean out, including stopping up his spring.Jean's new life is hard but he makes it work. That is until there is a drought. Jean eventually works himself to death. His widow sales the farm to Caesar. The final scene is Caesar and his nephew unplugging the spring but unknown to them, little Magnon sees this.Claude Beri is on of the great French directors. He has captured the flavor the rural France at the turn of the century. This is Depardieu's finest performance and is the first film that brought future French superstar Daniel Auteuil to the American filmgoer. And it is nice to see Yves Montand again.This is part one of two films call Pagnol's Water Stories. The second is the even better, Magnon of the Springs. But both films stand alone and you do not need to see both - but it is recommended.DVD EXTRAS: NONE",

He does not know of the spring which was blocked and concealed by the neighbor who desires not only his land to grow chrysthanthemums upon, but one day when she blooms, his daughter Manon. With the conspiracy of friends, this covetous neighbor blocks the spring which would bring life and fertility to the farm. Jean tries everything including tragically dynamite to bring the waters to flow with abundant life.When all is too late we discover unknown family ties which would have made Jean not a rejected outsider intruding upon and rejected by this enclosed and impoverished mountain farming community but embraced as a lost son. At that point the characters can only stand back and lament their realization come far too late. The inevitable development and tragedy of these two films together is as stately as as horrifying as a trilogy of ancient Greek plays, as profound and as universal.

In addition to the beautiful scenery of the southern French coutryside, the direction and acting create a most touching drama on the human condition.Jean de Florette (Gerard Depardieu) is a city man whose inheritance of a small tract in rural France encourages him to abandon his urban life and become a farmer. Confident that the land holds a spring to quench the parched earth, Jean becomes obsessed with applying his newly learned agricultural skills. Although Jean understands the science of agriculture, he's innocent as to the mindset of farmers such as his neighbors played by Yves Montand and Daniel Auteuil. His idealistic notion of pastoral life deceives him into thinking that his neighbors are welcoming and honest folk who wish to help him in his pursuits: he couldn't be further from the truth. In the end, Jean becomes the victim of his own credulity and of his neighbor's schemes. Befriending Jean, the neighboring farmers actually want the land for themselves and will do anything to keep it barren.This is an extremely good movie with rich detail and metaphor. The acting is top knotch and the cinematography is stunning. I strongly recommend this film.",

As a whole the story is well rounded, true to life and deeply fulfilling. The writer Pagnol, is widely recognised as a genuis, the director and the actors/actresses reputations preceed them. This film does them justice. Be prepared for a moving and well-written experience, and don't miss the astonishing unfolding of revenge and hope in the sequel.A truly inspiring work, well adapted to film.

Although each film stands on its own, it is the full story that they, combined, tell that makes the experience of the film so profound. It is a crime that they are not offered together.The story of greed and deception, of cruel avarice leading to tragic consequences, is further enhanced in the terrible irony and effect of mistakes and devastating secrets revealed in the second film. However, this film is complete in telling the first part of the story as we watch a kind and humane man, albeit naive, the Jean of the title (Depardieu) undone by two neighbors (Montand &amp; Autielle) who covet his farmland. Jean's desperation and anguish as he struggles to keep his dream alive is achingly conveyed by Depardieu in a brilliant performance.The two films also gave that old master, Yves Montand, one last magnificent role to cap his career. He is simply wonderful as a shrewd and coldly calculating patriarch, his lazily sly eyes bitterly amused by his manuevers, setting in motion events that will reverberate and return to him in ways he could not possibly fathom. It is so rich and full a performance, that spans both films, that you will be surprised by your different emotions about this man. Montand's work here should not be missed by anyone who loves great acting. He is ably matched by Daniel Autielle as his torn, sad, and conflicted nephew.Directed with great care and beautifully filmed in the countryside of southern France, Jean de Florette is a fine film by itself. But, when seen with Manon of the Springs, the two together make a masterpiece of the consequences of cruelty and greed.Let's hope they get Manon on DVD and box them together. 4 stars each, 5 together.",

A farmer, Le Papet (played by Yves Montand) and his nephew, Ugolin (Daniel Auteuil) scheme against the city inheritor, Jean Cadoret (Gerard Depardieu) of a neighboring farm, keeping secret from him the whereabouts of a hidden spring. Ugolin wants the land to grow flowers on; Jean has plans for breeding rabbits and growing vegetables. Jean comes with his books and statistics about crops and the weather; he has faith in his knowledge, but believes in God's providence, too. He is a hunchback as well, which only adds to our sympathies. A drought comes and sure enough the lack of water ruins him and the farm is sold to Ugolin. But Jean's little daughter learns of the spring just before they leave, which sets up the action for the sequel: MANON OF THE SPRING.Like all good folktales, the story here is simple and straightforward, and the telling is always interesting. The characters are all well developed and their motivations are complex enough to keep them human and not types. The movie is a real throwback to pre-New Wave classics such as HARVEST (1937). A comparative fortune was spent in making this movie, but it was money well spent. Definitely worth a watch.",

    "review/text": "This is one of those films that continues to haunt the imagination years after you see it. The conflict is so classic: a good and dangerously naive man (Depardieu) falls prey to a calculating and evil neighbor (Montand), who is helped along the way by a hapless relation (Auteuil). These actors form a trio that is unsurpassed in French cinema and their chemistry is so painfully believable that it is hard to watch the events unfold.The prolific Depardieu has never been better as the well-intentioned hunchback returning to his inherited land to live a more natural life. Montand, his murderous neighbor who covets the land, is so believably evil as a dried up and selfish man that it is truly chilling. And Auteuil is so weak and pathetic as he participates in Montand's machinations, yet so lonely that he is sympathetic as well.It is so refreshing to see a film that is so un-Hollywood, so self-consiciously determined to tell a great tragic story rather than some syrupy mishmash.Get it. YOu won't be disappointed.",

Often some people just hate French movies, because they are so pecked with meaning and philosophy, and they are so lengthy and slow. Although, I can not say that this movie is too different from the typical european cinema stereotype, Jean de Florette is very moving and powerful movie. These two movies, together, bring to us the historical picture of the late 19th century, France. I thought the movie had a great theme: intellectual man, who wants to live like a Roussau's noble savage(man of freedom), move into a small rural, agricultural town. He tries to use methods developed by scientists and rationalists into farming. At the same time, the story introduces a native farmer with dark intentions, jean de florette. His greed, pretention, and obsession drive him to do unthinkable evil to his new neighbor. Jean de Florette is a must have classic for all movie lovers.",

    "review/summary": "While this movie does entertain, it does have a weak storyline",
    "review/text": "The motion picture \"Coyote Ugly\" is a story that takes place in the world famous \"Coyote Ugly\" saloon in New York City. The \"Coyote Ugly\" saloon rose to fame in the 1990s. The saloon was the brainchild of Liliana \"Lil\" Lovell. The thing that distinguishes this saloon from many others is that \"Coyote Ugly\" features female bartenders dancing on the bar that often will challenge customers to drinking contests while performing outrageous antics. \"Coyote Ugly\" first rose to fame in 1997 when \"Gentlemen's Quarterly\" magazine published the experiences as told by a former \"Coyote Ugly\" barmaid named Elizabeth Gilbert. The publicity of this article along with the success of the New York bar would soon lead to the movie \"Coyote Ugly\". This movie basically is a movie that is set in a Hollywood version of the bar. While this movie will entertain the audience, it can't seem to overcome a weak storyline.One thing that I was immediately disappointed with is that \"Coyote Ugly\" isn't the story on how Lovell formed the \"Coyote Ugly\" saloon (which I think could have been the basis for an interesting story). Instead, producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson along with writer Gina Wenkos tell the story of an shy aspiring songwriter Violet Sanford (played by Piper Perabo) from South Amboy, New Jersey who leaves behind her father (played by John Goodman, who delivers one of his best performances) and a job at a local Pizza Parlor to pursue a songwriting career in New York City. When Violet arrives in New York, she realizes that breaking into the music business isn't all that it is cracked up to be. Desperate for work, Violet hears about an opening at the \"Coyote Ugly\" bar. Violet goes to meet Lil Lovell (played by Maria Bello) who sees something in Violet and decides to give her an audition. After some rough goes, Lil eventually hires Violet on a regular basis. The shy Violet will at first be uncomfortable with the aggressive nature of the bar, but will soon grow into the role while keeping it a secret from her father At the same time, Violet develops a relationship with Kevin O'Donnell (played by Adam Garcia) who convinces Violet to overcome her remaining shyness and sing her songs herself. Eventually, her job at Coyote Ugly, her quest to try to sing her songs, the relationship with Kevin, and her relationship with her father will all reach a head.One of the main reasons why Coyote Ugly will entertain is because of the dancing and the soundtrack. The dance scenes in the bar are spectacular. Although the bar scenes are exaggerated from what actually goes on in the saloon. they are going to entertain you. Director David McNally does a sensational job at putting integrating music throughout the movie - whether it is a bar scene or not. While this film did spawn two soundtrack albums (\"Coyote Ugly\" and \"More Music from Coyote Ugly\"), it is worth noting that there are a few songs in the movie not found on the soundtracks (most notably, Def Leppard's \"Pour Some Sugar On Me\"). The music and dancing come together perfectly when the Coyote Dancers perform The Charlie Daniels Band's \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\".The movie has two noteworthy performances. John Goodman is the perfect person to play Bill Sanford - Violet's father. He brings the perfect balance of humor and sensitivity that is needed for the role. While I am not a Goodman fan, I really enjoyed his performance. The other standout performance is delivered by rising star Bridget Moynahan who plays the Rachel - a dancer with attitude who will give Violet a hard time at working at the bar. Playing this kind of a role was something new to Moynahan and she pulls it off flawlessly.Unfortunately the story just isn't that strong to support the music or the performances of Goodman and Moynahan. The weak storyline is seen throughout the movie, but probably is best illustrated in the scenes where Violet first goes to work at the bar. To me, the story doesn't do a good job at convincing me how Lil Lovell sees something in the shy Violet Sanford that she hires her for an audition and then give her several chances to secure a job at the bar. I didn't like the way that Violet overcame her early struggles in working at the bar - it seemed too scripted to me. In general, the \"Coyote Ugly\" bar serves as a backdrop for the story of the movie - but I would have preferred the movie to revolve more around the bar and the Coyote dancers that worked there. Namely, they could have done so much more to develop the character of Rachel as well as a lesser-extent Lil and another dancer named Cammie.Perhaps one of the big letdowns of the movie is Adam Garcia. Garcia is famous for his outstanding portrayal of Tony Manero in the London stage version of \"Saturday Night Fever\". Garcia is someone who has shown real talent. Although Garcia doesn't do a bad job in the movie, the film doesn't do a good job at utilizing his talents (for example there is only one big dance scene with Garcia). I would have liked to see Garcia have more interactions with some of the other characters - for example, interactions with Violet's overprotective father would have been very interesting.It is worth noting that Supermodel Tyra Banks and singer Leann Rimes have cameo roles in this movie.Overall the movie will entertain - especially from a musical standpoint and a comedic standpoint. The ending is actually pretty good as well. However, the shortcomings of the storyline are going to be too much to overcome. You may be a bit disappointed if you have been to the \"Coyote Ugly\" saloon. This might not be a movie you watch over and over, but it is still worth checking out.",

    "review/summary": "Not just a \"chick flick\" movie",
    "review/text": "Although the cast list is comprised of mostly females, there are many aspects that allow `Coyote Ugly' to reveal itself as more than just another \"chick flick\". The sex appeal that the movie possesses is reminiscent of a `Girls Gone Wild' video; but with a PG-13 twist. Had the film been pushed to R, it's hard to say if it would've received more or less attention. The women never really reveal anything. And for the most part that's okay. But as another reviewer noted, there is not enough Tyra Banks. She's on the cover, in the movie for about 15 minutes, and then gone. I guess in the end it doesn't really matter; but still, they shouldn't lead the viewer on. When it comes to the actual storyline, a lot can (or cannot) be said. If you're a male, the plot probably won`t affect you. However, the female audience will surely be intrigued by the character of Jersey (first-timer Piper Perabo).The plot is based on that character; who is lost in life and needs something to help boost her music career. She obviously has talent, but two things drag her down. One... her father (John Goodman) doesn't want her to leave because he'd then have no one to wash his cloths. Two... she has an enormous fear of being on stage. With that being said, the movie just goes off those two aspects. Jersey does find a job, but it's not your average profession. The job title is said to be a bartender, but it could be explained as a singer/bartender/stripper/dancer. As it's old hat with Jerry Bruckheimer films, it does a great job with the in-your-face sequences. When the woman are dancing on the bar to oldies (or whatever), the camera work shoots back and forth very nicely. And even though this movie seems like a `Charlie's Angles' without the action, it gives you a real charge. Finding a bar like this is as far-fetched as the ending to `Armageddon' was (okay, not really). It seems like the kind of bar people'd dream about. Since I don't like to ruin movies for people, I will stop here. There are a lot of interesting parts in this movie. There's some good comedy; mostly courtesy of John Goodman. I particularly enjoyed when someone honks their horn at him when he`s working. I won't spoil that for you either. But the acting by Perabo is rather average, but can be condoled since it's here first major role. The role of Kevin (Adam Garcia) will certainly be enjoyable for the females, since he brings his own type of male sex appeal to the movie. And the appearances by funnymen Johnny Knoxville and Chris Wylde are genuinely good cameos; though not as good as LeAnn Rimes playing herself. The characters of most of the bartenders are not well-covered, but I think it was intended to be that way. And the fact that Zoe (Tyra Banks) left to become a lawyer is smart; as it shows the women are not just brainless, low I.Q. bartenders. Still, although most of the movie's aspects are covered, some of them are not covered too well.Whether you're a boy or a girl, there's great chance you'll enjoy `Coyote Ugly'. If you like the female-fronted movies then there's no question you'll like this one. If you're a male, and you're looking for hot, sensual movies with endless spraying of beer and close-to/would-be strippers, you'll probably enjoy it too. I gave the movie 3 stars; I enjoyed it a lot, but as I've hinted to, was a little disappointed with it as a whole. I give Bruckheimer and co. credit for doing a movie like this, though I don't feel it is quite as good as his other \"action\" movies. This film is not a let-down because of its PG-13 rating, and it's certainly not just a \"chick flick\". I do recommend this, but know what you like first.",

    "review/text": "Movie Summary: Violet Sanford leaves her small New Jersey home as well as her father and moves to the Big Apple. She wants to be a song writer you see and New York is the place to be. She soon finds out that the music game is ever so much more difficult than she dreamed. In order to make ends meet, she wins a job as a performing waitress at the very hip club Coyote Ugly. There the nights are hot and the bar maids even hotter. Violet meets a nice guy who tries to help he overcome the stage fright that is preventing her from showcasing her songs on stage. As she falls into a grove at Coyote Ugly is starts to look like she will never make it as a song writer.My Opinion: I loved the bar scenes. That's where the 4 stars come from. I like the scenes with the Coyotes in them. They were the most interesting and the most fun. The rest of the story was cute, but what I really wanted was more of the Coyote Ugly. That was what was fun. I didn't really need another &quot;little girl makes it in the big city&quot; story. I did enjoy Kevin O'Donnell and his character. It was nice to see a good guy getting the girl for a change. I'm sick of the jerks that are mean to the girls and the girls who want them more because of it. John Goodman was great as the father struggling to be on his own. Maria Bello has been one of my favorites for a long time and she doesn't let us down here. I only wish she could have been the main character and we could have also seen into the lives of each of the Coyotes. Even though I wished for more of the bar, I was thoroughly entertained and enjoyed every minute of the movie. I ate up the deleted scenes that rounded out the story and filled in the holes. I will definitely be looking for a good deal on a used copy of this DVD to add to my collection.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 the best! Video quality is great! Sound: DD5.1 with great music Extras: There are plenty of extras. The deleted scenes show why we shouldn't have been surprised when Gloria got married. They also show people taunting Violet with predictions that she will fail. They help fill out the plot. Also included are the trailers, documentaries, and music video. Menus: The menus are ok. Nothing to write home about.What You Should Do: Rent it unless you can get a good deal on a previously viewed copy. It's a guilty pleasure type movie, but the price for a new copy is too high.Related Movies To Check Out: Road House, Flashdance, Cocktail, Doc Hollywood",

    "review/text": "Jerry Bruckheimer is a wonderful director. He continues to display his talents in this entertaining film with a good cast.The plot is fairly simple, but it works for this movie. A young songwriter from New Jersey, who has a severe case of stagefright, moves to New York to hopefully &quot;make it.&quot; Stuggling financially, she takes a job as a bartender/waitress at a wild bar named &quot;Coyote Ugly.&quot; Here, the &quot;eye-candy&quot; female bartenders partake in wild stage acts to enhance the bar's nightlife image. While working at this bar ann befriending several other workers, the young songwriter, Violet, hopes to break into the entertainment industry.Rising star, Piper Perabo, plays the perfect Violet, and John Goodman is an excellent compliment to her as her father. Besides, Goodman practically steals the whole movie in the very last scene, but you'll have to buy the film to see what I mean. Maria Bello, who plays the owner of the bar, also adds in a steller performance, not to forget, Adam Garcia, who plays Violet's love interest quite nicely, although his character develops late in the film. Add in supermodel, Tyra Banks, in a cameo role, and the movie just grows on you.On the whole, this was a pretty good movie. It was fairly fast-paced, and the storyline, although simplistic, was well-defined. The actresses were very pleasing to the eye, and they all acted well together, providing an overall nice cohesive film. It is a good, solid effort.",

The beautiful bartenders are thrown in there only to entice some of the male audience to come watch the film (they really are nice to look at). There's no skin shown, though there is quite a lot of &quot;exotic dancing&quot; in the movie. It's a rather cliche theme and you know how the movie will end half-way through watching it, but amazingly, you'll still find yourself enjoying the ending. Violet's adorably innocent face makes you care how she ends up, and the love scenes are touchingly sappy. Find yourself smiling after watching it.",

Coyote Ugly is just repeating this, with a particularly annoying character who suffers from one of the most demented looking cases of stage fright I've ever seen.Jerry Bruckheimer usually does good films, but this is a case in which I would love to ask him what he was thinking. The only attraction to this film is a bunch of girls dancing on top of the bar, and the singing of LeAnn Rimes. He could easily have just made a few music videos and dispensed with the vehicle for presenting them. It would have done us all a favour.",

    "review/text": "&quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; has to be the best romantic dramedy this year, even though this year has had it's share of bad romances-Autumn in New York, Down to You and The Next Best Thing just to name a few. The bar dancing scenes are incredible accompanied by a fantastic soundtrack including one of my favorites, &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me&quot;. Plus there are two new great songs from LeAnn Rimes,who is also in the movie, but I'm not reviewing the soundtrack so I'll skip this. And that's just the stuff you see in the previews. What you don't see on the surface through the previews are the great performances from newcomer Piper Perabo, Adam Garcia and the always great John Goodman. the story is mainly about Piper Perabo's character, nicknamed Jersey, who goes into the big city trying to get someone to perform her well written songs. She runs into several problems with a new boyfriend, some disagreements with her father, and many crazy encounters at the bar &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;. The title is explained in the movie to mean when you go home with a one night stand after a night of big drinking and you wake up with someone so ugly that you would rather chew your arm off than wake them up to know you're leaving. Believe me, you're not going to feel that way leaving this one! BUY THIS MOVIE!!!",

As a huge movie fan, and one who enjoys strong stories like Seven and American History X, I can assure you that it takes a lot to impress me. I'm not saying this is an original story, or that it packs a punch like those two films, but it certainly is an enjoyable film with strong characters that you really come to like very quickly. Maria Bello is fantastic as the straight-talking owner of Coyote Ugly, and Adam Garcia plays a sweet and noble comic collector to perfection. Don't trust the reviews that say this is crap - the story is solid, the cast is flawless and the music will have you out to buy the soundtrack in no time.",

The people that actually decided to see it(which was no small amount-$60 million worth) found that it was about a young female songwriter,played exceptionally well by rising star Piper Perabo, who moves into the big city trying to sell her music and finds herself working and the craziest bar since the Ti--y Twister in &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;. Of course the men will be more than entertained by the hot, dancing barmaids which make some great &quot;action&quot; scenes for the film, but what for the women? The women actually get more out of it than the men. A great plot-the storyline mentioned earlier plus getting rid of stage fright, setting things straight with her father, finding how far a true love would go. Great overall movie, good characters, good acting, good setting. Truely a good movie for everyone. Just go see it!

It was in my opinion, one of the cutest and funnest movies of 2000. Piper (Violet-leading actress) played the right role for the part. She has an innocent face that's hard not to fall in love with. As for the leading actor, he too shines in his part, with his down to earth personality that depicts the hard-working population of society. I highly recommend this movie, not only for the so called, &quot;hot babes,&quot; (as many males would describe it) but for the countless breathtaking moments of desire for sweet love. If you're a romantic, you'll surely LOVE this movie, because I know I did. Leann Rimes really fit in great in the picture also. Her songs worked magic upon the atmosphere of the movie. I even have the soundtrack! Anyhow, I hope all of you watch this movie because I'm sure both guys and girls will enjoy it, and maybe you'll appreciate your significant other afterwards... or strive to reach your career.",

Having trouble getting her foot in the door, she ends up working at a wild bar where the female patrons dance around on the bar in wet T-shirts to cheesy cheerleader anthems. John Goodman turns in an enjoyable performance as Perabo's overprotective father. Those expecting an edgier and more adult-oriented version of \"Coyote Ugly\" with its new \"unrated cut\" may want to save their money. With the exception of an added sex scene involving Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia (Perabo's nude shots were filmed with a \"double\"), the movie is still \"PG-13\" country. It's the same sexually-suggestive but far from edgy content you'll find in the theatrical cut.",

    "review/text": "The previews of Coyote Ugly looked pretty good, so I went out and rented the DVD. The movie turned out to be pretty good, as long as you let your brain take a rest.The storyline of the movie seems pretty basic: young girl goes to New York to make it big as a songwriter, and ends up working in a bar to make ends meet. The bar isn't just any bar though, it's Coyote Ugly, where the barmaids dance on top of the bar and hose down anyone asking for water. Eventually she finds herself a sexy Australian boyfriend and gets the chance to perform her song.The movie is actually pretty entertaining, Piper Perabo makes an excellent Violet, and John Goodman is good as her father. Coyote Ugly makes me wish there were bars where I lived like that; I'd have a reason to go to one if there were. The soundtrack has a lot of upbeat music, which helps the movie keep its upbeat feel.I found two disappointments in the movie, the first being that Piper Perabo doesn't sing in the movie; Leanne Rhimes does all the singing. I was hoping Perabo would sing, as there don't seem to be a lot of actors that sing and act anymore.The second disappointment was the lack of character development in everyone but Violet and her father. They're fairly well developed, you know about how Violet grew up, and how he father acts towards her, but the other barmaids, the boyfriend, and the owner of the bar seem one dimensional. You know that the barmaid that's leaving (Tyra Banks) is going to law school, one barmaid has problems with anger management, and the other one is a blond tease. That's about it though, and the owner isn't any better. She only keeps things in the bar that she drinks, and if you have the DVD and watch the deleted scenes, you find out how she got the bar. The boyfriend (Adam Garcia) is probably the third best developed character in the movie, but they don't really develop him until near the end.All in all, Coyote Ugly is a good movie to watch, as long as you're not the type to pick apart movies. It doesn't have a heavy plot, and there's enough eye candy for both sexes to make the movie worth watching for most people.",

You get occasional glimpses at the girls dancing on the bar and flinging water, drinks, and ice on their customers. Other than Violet, the other women at the bar aren't featured. You learn nothing about them. And if you're a Tyra Banks fan, don't bother watching this movie. She's on screen about ten minutes. That's a generous estimate.

I just could not take my eyes off of Cammie (Izabella Miko) -- probably physically the least attractive of the dancers but has a great smile, tons of energy and confidence, and is a very seductive dancer. I was less enamored with the lead character, Violet (Piper Perabo), a small town girl with big dreams but is afraid to take chances (stage fright??). I personally found it difficult to root for her character but she is very pretty and innocent and fits into the role very well. I dug the look on her face after her suitor &quot;Mr. O'Donnell&quot; (Adam Garcia) deadpans, &quot;It's 3 in the morning ... I want what every other man wants now.&quot; Speaking of Garcia, I thought he did a great job, at least until they neutered his character about 2/3s in. &quot;I'll fire you Walt!&quot;Overall, when the focus isn't on the bar though, the movie really struggles. It isn't so much the cliches involved, it's just the writing. It would have been nice to see Violet gradually gather the confidence needed to succeed from her time at Coyote Ugly and with her friends, to see her gradually develop into a city girl, and naturally reconcile with her father rather than have it all occur spontaneously when the plot demands. To be honest the plot gave me a headache. But overall, it's a fun movie if you don't expect much, worth a rental at least.",

It is basically a story of a naive girl from New Jersey who comes to New York to persue her dream as a singer/songwriter.When she realizes that she isn't going to be an instant success, she takes a job in club with the title name. Her dancing skills improve and her fear of perfoming in front of crowds starts to diminish. She incidentally meets a nice young man whom she starts seeing, and though there are troubles, her move to the top is going strong by the end of the movie.The plot is very predictable, but the acting is well above average. It was nice to see of movie of this genre with relatively little foul language. I don't believe the &quot;F&quot; word was used at all. All in all, a nice and enjoyable movie that is suitable for most members of the family. I recommend it.",

A girl (Piper Perabo) who obviously can't sing &quot;Can't Fight The Moonlight&quot; (Leann Rimes does it better, and only has a small cameo towards the end), and is the spitting image of ex All Saints singer, Melanie Blatt.This film is very disappointing. Don't watch it with your hopes high. It's predictable, and you were laying out the plot before it was happening. Of course she's going to lose the job because of stupid Adam Garcia; of course something's going to happen to her Dad AFTER they have fallen out and she decides to come back and live in her hometown; there will be a big situation in the bar, which she defuses (by singing?!); and of course, she &amp; Adam Garcia will live happily ever after.I think if the film had been based more in the bar, then it would have been slightly better, but then it ran the chance of being boring, and too repetitive. But then the only scenes I enjoyed in this film were the madcap 'Coyotes' dancing on the bar.This movie had great potential. Shame they didn't attempt anything never already done about the movie.",

It's fairly cute, occasionally clever, occasionally bad, never tries to reach for a level of dramatic depth, and succeeds within its own limitations. The story is fairly hackneyed but painlessly rendered. Violet (Piper Perabo) moves to New York to become a singer-songwriter, instead finding herself as a provacative bartender at the Coyote Ugly bar, whilst falling in love with an Australian fry cook (Adam Garcia). I prefer this movie infinitely over other Jerry Bruckheimer creations. It is much better than Flashdance, a similar-themed story.True the acting isn't Oscar-worthy and some of the dialogue falls flat, but what was this movie trying to do? Entertain. And it succeeds enormously.A guilty pleasure.(extra note: this DVD provides one of the most entertaining commentary tracks with the cast doing a relay on each scene with joyful glee).",

It's not thought-provoking, it's filled with T&amp;A (this will be a recommendation for some people, a warning for others), the characters are mostly one-dimensional, and the plot carries more cliches than surprises. But so what? I just finished watching it and I'm smiling.Sometimes you want a movie that's full of people dancing and drinking and singing, full of pop songs that kind of make you want to dance around your living room, where the sweet innocent girl gets to be a little naughty but stay sweet and innocent, and where every character triumphs in some way. This is one of those movies. I will say that, despite the multiple female bodies on display (in minimal clothing, but always clothed), this strikes me as more of a girl movie than a guy movie. The romance plot seems aimed at women, as does Violet's personal journey to overcome stagefright. If you ever read those Sunfire romances when you were a teenager, this is one of those, dancing on a bar in leather pants and a halter top.",

This meaning that the one's that are any good really do make you sit up and pay attention. That doesn't mean to say that this film isn't full of the usual clich&eacute;s - cute virginal girl lost in the big city finds her own sexuality and individuality among others.Still, it's fun. For one, it's quite blatant without being in the least bit taboo. Our heroine finds work in a bar, finding that travelling to New York to sell songs isn't all it's cracked up to be. Initial clumsiness turns to refined solidarity with the other girls that work there and she finds a nice boy who understands her plight.With the cringe-making story you may think that there's nothing good here. You'd be wrong. There are some great performances from John Goodman and Melanie Lynskey (of 'Heavenly Creatures' fame - give her more roles!) and great characters like the sassy owner of the bar. There's some nice throwaway comedy lines and the songs that the girl writes are good but believably unrefined - most are sung solo by her on her keyboard. The nice thing about it is that it's sweet without ever ramming it down your throat and you can sit back and relax knowing that everything's going to work out right in the end. Plus there's the piece de resistance where LeAnn Rimes struts her stuff across the bar singing the fantastic 'Can't Fight The Moonlight'.",

I decided to include this movie in my list of films which, in a way or another, changed me or changed my way of seeing life. To be honest, till now it just added up another beautiful dream in my head. And now I am sharing this dream with my best friend. Hey Barb, we'll do it one day.

Guess how we'll call it?Apart from that, I highly recommend this movie to whoever needs a little more of hope in order to keep believing in good times, in friendship, and why not, also in love.",

But as I started watching it I loved it I just wanted to get up and dance along with Jersey and all of the other girls. Kevin was a hottie and I felt so bad when we found out that he didn't have a home and had to be moving around every 2 yrs. The music was great and after the second time watching it I felt that I knew all the words.I loved it and am looking foward to getting the soundtrack when I get my money from working. Well Thanks so much for listening and I hope to see a sequil. Sincerely",

    "review/text": "While it is true that Coyote Ugly may seem like the female version of Cocktail, it's refreshing that Bruckheimer decides to come down from the action packed flicks he is so used to making. Here, we see newcomer Adam Piper Perabo who plays Violet (Jersey). She is new to the city life from a small place and is quickly taken into the nightlife of the famous NYC bar, &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;. It's all entertainment and fun from there on. Aussie Adam Garcia also joins the cast as her love interest with a very nice character buildup. All in all, it's great to watch with one kick-butt soundtrack to go with it. Way to go Girls! The one downfall was the over promotion of the model, yra Banks who is only in the movie for 15 minutes.",

    "review/text": "This film deals with two different plots: An aspiring singer and a bar named Coyote Ugly. The story is a very good one about a young and inexperienced women (Violet) trying to make it as a singer in the Big Apple, but the problem is she has Stage Fright- that's where the bar comes in and the movie really takes off.Violet ends up getting a job in the bar as one of the women who serve drinks while dancing on the bar. The scenes in the bar coupled with the great music really gives the film energy and keeps the pace from getting too slow. They do not take away from the story, but hold it together. Working here helps Violet acquire the confidence she needs to make. There is also a love story between Violet and a guy she meets which completes the whole movie and makes it well worth watching.",

If you like; a simple story with characters you can get attached to, good pop music, and a movie that can get its point across without sex, blood, and violence, then this movie is for you. All of the characters are very likeable and the introduction of Leann Rimes' newest pop songs made this movie very appealing.If you're looking for a skin flick, don't bother. But to say that this movie would only appeal to teenage girls is pushing it way out of proportion. The absence of hot steamy sex scenes doesn't mean it is any less appealing, except for those of you who are only turned on by things of that nature.",

She moves to NYC to fulfill her dreams of becoming a songwriter. She meets a handsome Aussie, whom she is under the impression is a big music mogel. However, she finds out he is only a cooks in a restaurant, plus about 3 other jobs. (the man doesn't sleep). Anyway, the plot moves along nicely, a few areas that you can tell the edit left out.

    "review/text": "Coyote Ugly brings absolutely nothing new to the table, but taking the movie at its own merit, it's not actually all that bad. The plotline in a nutshell, Violet moves to New York to make it as a songwriter, not knowing that it's not as easy as just going to a record company and giving them a demo tape(is anyone really that nave), and ends up working at a bar called Coyote Ugly to make money until she can sell her songs. That's it, except for the standard romantic interest, and the fact that the women at Coyote Ugly don't only pour drinks, they dance on the bar, spray down the customers with booze and water, and are full of attitude.The problem for Violet is that the only way to get her songs heard is to sing them herself at open mic nights at clubs. Unfortunately for her, she's too afraid to sing her own songs in public. She's not too afraid to sing along with the jukebox at Coyote Ugly, or dance on top of the bar for a bunch of leering men, but I guess that's just a different story. How, I really couldn't see, but it is, or so we're told. Yeah, I'm still shaking my head over that one myself.For those of you who are interested in flesh, I have to disappoint you and let you know that this movie is PG-13 so you won't be seeing any nudity here. In fact, the only person who takes their top off dancing on the bar is Violet's love interest, who does a dance on the bar while she's auctioning him off to the highest bidder to try to make up the $250 she needs to give to Lil, the bars owner, for dousing down the fire marshall with water, causing them to get a fine. The $250 is what she needs to raise to pay the fine so she doesn't get fired. Who ever said a movie really had to make sense?Still though, the girls are all good looking, and they do have some good moves, and I felt fairly entertained, at least after the first twenty minutes which were kind of slow and boring. The plot isn't hard to follow, as you've probably seen it dozens of times before, from the inevitable misundertanding that leads to Violet's and Kevin's break up, down to the ending, where Violet still doesn't know whether or not she can sing her songs in front of other people until Kevin shows up to save the day.So no, you won't see anything new here, but the story isn't offensive on its own, and there are some funny moments, and some good looking women, so it's not a total bust either. Try it out for yourself, it's good for at least one viewing.",

The great thing about movies is that sometimes it's fun just to sit back, put your mind in neutral and just enjoy. Coyoye Ugly Fits that bill perfectly. The movie moves at a pretty snappy pace, the music is great and the scenery is nice to look at. The movie trailers I'd seen for Coyote Ugly left me with a &quot;less than enthusiastic&quot; impression of this movie. Because of my endless search for great movies that slide under the radar, I gave it a whirl anyway. I was pleasantly surprised. If your looking for a movie that's light and a lot of fun, pick this one up, you won't be disappointed.",

And that didn't intrest me at all so I never saw it at the theaters. But when it came out on video all my friends where telling me what a great moive it was and I was shocked. It WAS good. It was a about a girl named Violet who traveled to the city to start a song writign carrer. But the problem is she was onyl getting snubbed. So in an attempt to make some quick cash she becomes a bar tender at a bar called cyote ugly. A place where women call all the shots and looking hot and being gwilling to do pretty much anything is a must. It takes her a while to get used to it but soon she learns that her voice is a powerful tool that could keep her this job, and maybe get her futher. If she could just get rid of her stage fright.THis movie was a great drama and romatic comedy (even though I didn't mention a guy in my summary). I reccomend it to anyone.

The last half-hour was great! The mid-movie doubts are quickly erased as it concludes. The use of John Goodman, Violet's father, was a nice touch. A powerful ending leaves you feeling great about this movie.The storyline was good and the acting was excellent.

Violet (Piper Perabo) heads to New York City to make it as a singer, but finds the road to success is tougher than anticipated. Violet gets a job as a waitress in the real life bar the Coyote Ugly and it is there that she makes new friends, while showing the world how great a singer she is. LeAnn Rimes did the actual singing of the Violet character as Perabo's vocals were dubbed. Rimes also makes a special guest appearance in the movie.The film was a modest success at the boxoffice, but more importantly, the soundtrack became huge, going 4X Platinum in 2008. Rimes breakout pop hit \"Can't Fight The Moonlight\" would go all the way to #11 on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart.The DVD is filled with bonuses including a LeAnn Rimes music video, commentaries, extra scenes, trailer, and more. The film was also directed by big-time Hollywood director Jerry Bruckheimer.In all a fun film, with great music, and characters the audience can enjoy.",

A new nightclub with a twist, Coyote Ugly is the hottest spot in town, featuring a team of sexy, enterprising young women. Lil is the savvy and tough proprietor with an autocratic reign over her girls, including the ever-flitarious Cammie, headstrong and antagonistic Rachel and top tip earner Zoe. Coyote Ugly. It is a very fun and exciting movie. There is also extremely good music in the movie, and also has a great soundtrack. This is a very good movie.",

However, if you just want to relax and fill your mind with a couple of hours of loud music, a gooey romance, and a &quot;dreams finally fulfilled&quot; kind of story, this is the right movie. The women dance hard, the boy is cute (and one of the founders of the group Tap Dogs), and the songs Violet writes are a little too sappy to be pop. Playing the 'new girl' Piper Perabo turns in a believable performance as the wide-eyed hopeful in the big bad city. However, it was always a little too convenient that everytime she or those around her get in hot water, she always saves the day. The supporting cast of women are indeed bad girls punching guys and mouthing off whenever possible. The features on the DVD are actaully pretty inventive. So by all means buy the movie if you're gonna need something thoughtless to get through an all nighter or a slow Friday night. In short, it's just brainless fun.",

This movie was originally designed to be marketed towards teenage girls, as a triumphant story of a girl making it in life on her own. After being tested to that market they found that the movie, with a horrible plot, bad acting, and miserable premise could only be lucrative if it was marketed to males age 16-35, nice save Bruckheimer, why don't you stick to making movies like Con Air and The Rock. This movie fails at everything except introducing me to a cute actress, not the lead, but, Izabella Miko who plays Cammie, the cute &amp; sweet bartender who looks fabulous. Other problems include John Goodman's acting talent being wasted on a miserable character-in a miserable movie(look at him in The Big Labowski). The only difference between Showgirls and Coyote Ugly is that Showgirls doesn't lie about what it is and hide under a PG-13 rating by removing the nudity and vulgarness that would be present at a bar of this type (I mean who are we kidding-has anyone ever been to a bar that has the moral standards of Sesame Street?).",

Perabo's acting was so annoying, she ruined the whole movie for me. Her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded. I just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling!

    "review/text": "Despite what I've been reading on some of the review, I think this movie was amazingly done, with awesome choreography, beautiful girls for the guys, and a hot guy with a cute accent for the girls. Piper Perabo plays Violet, a girl who's dream is to move to New York to become a Song writer. While she's trying to get people to listen to her demos, she meets a charming fellow named Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia). Lacking cash, Violet gets a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly, where the girls dress sexy and dance on the bar for the entertainment of the bar goers. There are so many different stories weaved into this movie, that it would take forever to describe them all. That and the fact that I don't want to be a spoiler for those who haven't seen the movie. But let me say this...like any teeny bopper flick, it goes along the story line. Girl meets guy, they fall in love, they break up, but in the end they end up back together. However, I wouldn't limit this movie only to teeny boppers. When I went to the theater, I saw people of all ages sitting and enjoying the movie. Personally, I loved it so much that after watching it twice in the theater, I ran out and bought the soundtrack (which is incredible) and waited, anticipating the release of this really great movie. When it was released, I found out that it was only coming out on DVD, which is a real shame, because not everyone has a DVD player, but since I am a devoted fan, I will anticipate the release of this video on VHS. One more comment, if you're a guy and you're not sure you want to see this becuase it seems like a &quot;chick flick&quot;...one picture...Tyra Banks dancing on the bar.",

This seemingly out-dated and crazy notion never once crops up in this brainless teen-fodder. Set in a bar, the bunch of yahoo's drinking there every night don't seem to bother that the barmaids NEVER SERVE ANYONE. I like to look at a hot girl as much as anyone (and the girls ARE nice) but ALL they do is dance on top of the bar. That's it. And the baying fools don't seem to mind. Not once do you hear, \"so.. uh.. can I get a drink, then?\" The place is packed, every night, with really, really sober people. I can't imagine the takings in that place.And what's with the refusal to serve water? See, this is their idea of \"hardcore\" and cool, that whenever some square asks for water, you blast that sucker with the water hose. Hil-ari-ous.Imagine the scene;Guy: Hi, can I have some water?Girl: Oh, you heard the man! H-2 - NO!Girl pulls out water hose.Guy: But it's for my medication, I need to take thi.. arghh!Exactly. Oh, the plot? Do you really want to know? Well, some girl moves to the city, wants to become a singer with her collection of really bland songs (just what we need, thanks) which she plays on her roof (in the \"poignant\" scenes, see?) and then she meets some idiot who she falls in lov... oh, come on, you KNOW what's going to happen already.But, like my title says, it's perfect for stupid people. Undemanding, happy-ending loving, stupid people. But for anyone with a clue, it's really awful stuff.

Everyone was actually dancing and singing and laughing and Ive never seen a movie that made a whole theatre of people do that, it was the best! I thought the opening credits were pretty boring, and certain scenes in the movie too, but I guess you kinda need the love story parts to tie it all together though. I really didnt like Perabo's character very much, she kinda bothered me, I dunno she actually seemed kinda stupid, i cant really explain it. Over all I thought the movie was pretty entertaining and very good...seeing wet girls jump around on a bar wasent so bad either!",

She lives with her concerned father,John Goodman.Violet comes to the Coyote Ugly,an urban cowboy bar where \"strong women\" order men around,wearing not much of anything. Maria Bello (before she was Viggo Mortensen's hot wife in A History of Violence),tells her to be \"available,but not too available.\" Violet falls for an Aussie.

There's mistaken identity,a relationship crisis... but in the end,Violet lives the American Dream.**SPOILER ALERT** In the end,Violet triumphantly sings her song atop the bar with LeAnn Rimes.\"Coyote Ugly\" is the family-friendly,toned-down \"Showgirls.\" It's good,bland fun!

This movie is so predictible. Get a young, motivated, talented [but slightly immature] young girl out of Small Town, USA to Big City, USA to pursue her dream. Have her then hone her craft for various companies and getting rejected time and time again. Have her end up in a lonely diner with only a few dollars to her name. To remendy her cash problem, she gets a job at a sleazy bar. Over time, the bar overtakes her life, and she loses her boyfriend and dad in the process. In a realignment of priorties, she walks out of the bar, and refocuses on her dream. In the end she makes it.That my friends, is the plot of this movie. For most people (myself included) this movie is a totally futile effort, topped by a totally annoying performance by Piper Perabo. The only people who might like this film are teens and twenty-somethings and those needing a little something to watch in the middle of the night (again, like myself).",

Piper Perabo is a very attractive songwriter looking to make it in the big city. My only problem is that isshe's from North Jersey. There goes that cliche again where anyone living up to 25 miles outside of Manhattan is moving to the big city. That's like moving from Independence Missouri to Kansas City. It's not that big of a deal especially when you grew up 25 miles away in South Amboy. People commute eveyday on NJ Transit. I'll get past that. (Bruckheimer) repeats a great Flashdance concepct however with too much sappy drama and impauseable messages. Piper needs a job so she makes it on the bar to dance at colt club Coyote Ugly (Hogs and Hefiers) to make ends meet where cute but silly drama take place. Her love interest starts off as a baffoon and continues to be one, taking Pipers sexual advances as she says a sultry \"Goodbye\" which really means \"Let's do it\". as Goodbye to impress her and be a her perfect guy. Sorry ladies not in this world! This is a fun movie especially for female teenagers as it's story book romance and star oriented goals are felt thouroughly. It's dramatic intensity is as deep as a puddle, while Flashdance had most viewers believing! This movie is sexy without offensive nudity and sex. Piper (Jersey) is really good in her part. John Goodman as Pipers dad plays a sensitive but easy role. You may finish this movie feeling good, or you may take it seriously enough to hate it's pie in the sky predictability.

Even tho I've never taken a job at a bar quite like Coyote Ugly, it shows that when you are trying to achieve a dream, you do whatever possible. So far when it comes to dancing on a bar, I've only ever done it for fun, but it just goes to prove that we don't have an easy time of it trying to make it in the music business, and this type of scenerio is incredibly possible because when you're desperate, you do whatever it takes, even if it means sacrificing a little bit of dignity...even tho you can still have a hell of a lot of fun doing it.

Too much focusing on women dancing on bars and not on story and characters, hence this is a boring movie, but the women are good, but this movie is boring. Now see you wouldnt get me on a table and dance and take it off, nope, not my thing. John Goodman as Piper Perabo's father is a treat though. This is Tyra Bank's first big movie breakout and see does it nice. As far as i'm concerned the thought of Coyote Ugly 2 would be more of the same, except that Piper Perabo, not Maria Bello trains the new recruit and it would be more of the same but new moves, but more of the same. Also starring Adam Garcia.",

This film explains the reason why I have nightmares from taking, eventually dropped out of, Women's Studies in college. I don't need to be manhandled like that by a film like Coyote Ugly, telling me that women like those depicted in the film are the bomb and everything. I rather watch true films, touching realistic issues that surround females such as Hoop Dreams, My Left Foot, and The Miracle Worker, not crappy movies like Coyote Ugly. What's up with the title? Really, what's up with the concept? No, really...what's up with the actual realization of this movie being made? Maybe I should open a bar, have women wooing the male patrons, and face the music of being deported to prison for numerous of pimping violations.",

I laughed at the thought of seeing it until one day when I noticed it was on Digital Cable. I figured I would amuse myself by taking a peak at acting at it's worst...I was wrong. I found myself to actually be enjoying it. I immediately watched it the next time it was on so that I could catch the movie in its entirety and I really enjoyed all aspects of the movie, so when I purchased a DVD Player recently, I knew that this was a \"must buy\" for me. The DVD is awesome and I recommend it to everyone who is looking to sit back and enjoy a fun and loveable movie.I would without a doubt give the movie 5 Stars",

Also, I don't understand why the movie switched between color and black-and-white -- I'm guessing the decision was made in a very late editing session because it didn't seem to have any context.

These include Top Gun, Days of Thunder, Crimson Tides, The Rock, Con Air, Enemy of The State, Armageddon, Gone in 60 seconds, and Remember the Titans. I own most of these on DVDs. The main reason I like his movies so much is because they are so entertaining and fun to watch over and over again. They have so much energy and heart, detailed characterization, setting, irony, and plot. No matter who the actors or directors are, Bruckheimer's movies are usually very entertaining. I would watch any movies made by Jerry Bruckheimer, and I am eagerly waiting for &quot;Pearl Harber&quot; to come out in movie theaters Memorial Day. Coyote Ugly is very different from the rest of Bruckheimer movies. Simply put, it is a girl's movie as opposed to being a guy's movie. In this film, the women ruled as agonists and the men are basically background settings and antagonists. Obviously I have a problem with that, being a man and all :) Another weak point was the use of sex. By that, I mean it relied too heavily on sexuality to carry the film, instead of relying on just plot, action, setting, and special effects---the usual good stuff. I mean sex is great, but you shouldn't have to rely on that like this film did. I don't know. Maybe I did not like it so much only because it did not have enough testosterone like the other Jerry Bruckheimer movies. Besides that, this movie did have plot and plenty of heart.",

She doesn't know a soul and happens to wander into a bar filled with \"coyotes\" (women who dance on the bar table provocatively and also bartend for the many--predominantly male--customers). This obviously male fantasy of a young, sheltered artist breaking out of her shell and becoming more in touch with her sensuality was just silly.

    "review/text": "Coyote Ugly is a weak movie in some ways. The plot is very simple and also very unoriginal. Violet, a young woman, leaves home, without the approval of her overprotective, widowed father, and goes to New York to pursue a songwriting career and try to make it on her own. To make ends meet in the meantime, she takes a job as a barmaid. She meets a guy who becomes her love interest. This whole plot could be summed in 30 minutes or less. The thing that stretches out the movie and makes it fun to watch is the music (an awesome soundtrack) and the wild antics that go on at the bar where Violet works.Fact is, Coyote Ugly isn't your average, ordinary, everyday bar. The barmaids dance on the bar, pour drinks on themselves and each other, spray customers with water, and outrageously flirt with the male customers. This is what makes the movie.I must say that much of the movie is unbelievable. By some miracle, Violet manages to make it as a songwriter after singing one song in one club. Also by some miracle, her father (charmingly played by John Goodman, I must add) does a total turnaround from sternly disapproving of her working in a bar to dancing on the bar himself. Violet's problem with extreme stage fright is also unconvincing. However, Coyote Ugly is worth watching for the great music and the dancing and other wild things that go in the bar.",

    "review/text": "Piper Perabo plays Violet, the nice girl from Jersey who moves to NYC to try to make it big as a songwriter. She lands a job as a \"coyote\" to support herself while she gets established, singing and dancing in a wild (wild, but still basically PG-13) bar. During her personal voyage of self-discovery and growth, she meets a guy (Adam Garcia) and has various adventures, and seeks to ultimately prevail over the shyness she must conquer, to reach her goals.As a guy, I rented this for predictable reasons. Ohhh, those previews... MERCY!!! However, this really is not a simple babefest in any way. It really is mostly about Violet's personal odyssey to overcome her fears and achieve her dreams. Be warned that although it is certainly sweet, it doesn't exactly stick to your ribs. The dialog is monumentally uninspired, and probably more cliche-ridden than any movie I've seen since... ummm.. well, it's in a different genre, but I'd have to mention \"Bats.\" Come on, writers! You could have done better than that. Anyway, Violet's journey is sort of a cross between the stories of Olivia Newton-John's character in \"Grease\" and Tom Cruise's character in \"Cocktail.\" That sounds freaky, but you'll see what I mean. Piper Perabo's Violet reminds me of a sort of cross between a waifish Amanda Peet and a nineties version of Audrey Hepburn, living out the story of a latter-day Minnie Pearl... There's a really fun soundtrack, which is always a plus... Also, the whole movie features a cornucopia of suspiciously well-toned midriffs -- I can just imagine all the girls in the film doing sit-up and \"crunch\" marathons between takes.Watch for Bud Cort, who played Harold in the cult favorite \"Harold and Maude!\" He plays the guy in the coffee shop, named Romero, who first introduces Violet to the other \"coyotes,\" and who gives her a free slice of pie to cheer her up.Supporting actors in general do a good job with the lines they're given. Maria Bello plays up her part well, as the brassy, tough-as-nails Lil, who owns the bar, and who becomes Violet's friend. Izabella Miko is somehow simultaneously babyishly cute, and devilish-looking, as Cammie. Tyra Banks is gorgeous, of course, and actually a pretty good actress, I thought. Bridget Moynahan is terrific as Rachel, the ferocious grrrrl dancer with a heart of gold -- she has such a strong presence it might get in her way, looking for future roles. Think of Linda Hamilton from the second Terminator movie, crossed with the Terminator himself, and you'll get a sense of what her character is like... John Goodman and Adam Garcia are great too -- heck, everyone does a good job, it's just that the lines are so ....Basically, this movie is a lot of fun, and it has an uplifting message, especially for younger viewers. If you want crackling dialogue, see \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" -- if you want a sweet movie that happens to have a lot of major babes in it, see \"Coyote Ugly.\" Two thumbs up.",

    "review/summary": "Have You Been To Coyote Ugly?",
    "review/text": "Coyote Ugly&quot; is a cliff-hanger in which Piper Perabo ventures into a Jerry Bruckheimer production and escapes more or less untouched.The film stars Perabo as one of a group of heedless wenches who dance on a bar and pour straight shots down the throats of the seething multitude. In a movie of this sort, it is inevitable that the song &quot;I Will Survive&quot; will sooner or later be performed by drunken pals. Next week's opening, &quot;The Replacements,&quot; makes us wait an hour to hear it. &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; takes no chances and puts it under the opening titles. Do you get the feeling these movies are assembled from off-the-shelf parts?There is a story beloved in movie lore about the time Howard Hawks asked John Wayne to appear in &quot;El Dorado.&quot; Wayne had already starred in Hawks' &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; and &quot;Rio Lobo,&quot; which were essentially the same picture. So was &quot;El Dorado.&quot; &quot;Shall I send over the script?&quot; asked Hawks. &quot;Why bother?&quot; asked the Duke. &quot;I've already been in it twice.&quot;Does Jerry Bruckheimer have the same nagging feeling of deja vu as he compares each new screenplay to those that have gone before? I wonder if he suspects his movie may not be original, as he contemplates a story about a girl from New Jersey who dreams of being a songwriter, moves to Manhattan, meets a guy, gets a job and has a heart-rending reconciliation with her dad, all in a movie that ends (yes, it really does) with the final line, &quot;What do you do when you realize all your dreams have come true?&quot;Bruckheimer and his director bring superb technical credits to this wheezy old story, and they add wall-to-wall music to make it sound like fun. But you can pump up the volume only so far before it becomes noise. I don't ask for startling originality in a movie like &quot;Coyote Ugly.&quot; I don't object to the scene in which the heroine and her guy neck in a convertible and regard the lights on a Manhattan bridge. I am not even surprised that the hero drives a classic car (no characters in Bruckheimer movies drive cars less than 25 years old unless they are parents or gangsters). I don't even mind the obligatory line, &quot;It's payback time!&quot; All I ask is that I be surprised a couple of times. Give me something I can't see coming and make it more unexpected than a beloved character getting hit by a car instead of having a heart attack.In the movie, Perabo, who has big-time star power, plays Violet, a working-class girl from South Amboy, N.J., who packs up and moves to a cheap apartment in Chinatown (where she meets not a single Chinese person) and gets a job in Coyote Ugly, a bar that would be the result if you took the bar in &quot;Cocktail&quot; and performed reckless experiments on its DNA.It's the kind of bar you would fight to get out of--and you'd have to. Customers are jammed so tightly together, the fire marshal can barely wedge his way into the room. They are offered no mixed drinks, no wine, just &quot;Jim, Jack, Johnny Red, Johnny Black and Jose--all my favorite friends,&quot; according to Lil (Maria Bello), the sexy blond who owns the club. &quot;You can have it any way you want it, as long as it's in a shot glass.&quot;Violet auditions for her job, which consists of dancing on top of the bar, pouring drinks, dumping ice on customers who get into fights and spraying the others every so often with the soda gun. These are skilled dancers. They can do Broadway routines on a slippery bar top, while drunks grab at their ankles. Every once in a while, just for variety, they pour booze on the bar and set it on fire.Many of the movie's shots are high-angle, looking down at the customers, their mouths upturned and gulping like gasping fish. Illuminated by garish neon, they bear an uncanny resemblance to Hieronymus Bosch's paintings of the damned roasting in hell.After a shaky start, Violet becomes a hit at the bar; meanwhile, she tries to place tapes of her songs around town. She has stage fright, you see, and can't sing her own songs because she's afraid to sing in front of an audience, although she will obviously do almost anything else.She meets Kevin (Adam Garcia), an awfully nice Australian short-order cook who encourages her, and even bribes a guy to give her an audition by trading his precious Spider-Man comic. They would no doubt have steamy sex, except that Bruckheimer, a student of straws in the wind, knows this is the summer when PG-13, not his old favorite R, is the coveted rating. (His &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; was also PG-13, which may explain why Angelina Jolie was missing from most of the film.)&quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; finally leads up to the questions: (1) Does she find the courage to sing? (2) Do they stay together after their Idiot Plot Misunderstanding? and (3) Do all of her dreams come true?There is a reason to see the movie, and that reason is Piper Perabo, who I first noticed in &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,&quot; writing that she was &quot;so fetching she sort of stops the clock.&quot; She has one of those friendly Julia Roberts smiles, good comic timing, ease and confidence on the screen, and a career ahead of her in movies better than this one. Lots better.",

And in this movie Parabo is a strident, sell a little T and A as far as one can w/o becoming a stripper with as much a grasp on the real world annoyance. The movie is a toy for high school/college age mopes who find places where the worst kept secret in the bar business- hiring hotties to sucker young, naiive men into spending money they can't afford- interesting places to hang out at. This is \"Cocktail\" in reverse, to an extent. This is one of those movies that creates a non-existing, pure utopia of a bar. The place where everyone basically laughs, cheers and sings in unison at a contrived, silly atmosphere that only exists in the minds of Hollywood execs, and college campuses to a much lesser extent. The dialogue also is equal to that of \"Coctail\"- pointless, been there before, dense dialogue. If you're young and have yet to be in touch with real life, see this. It's a fantasy flick for escapism. If you're a quality film lover, run the other way!",

The commercials made it look like it was going to be hot chicks doing wild and crazy stuff at the bar through the whole thing but I'd have to say that only about 15 minutes of this movie took place at the bar. Piper Perabo annoyed the crap out of me. She was always making these puppy dog faces like she is saying, &quot;Look how cute and adorable I am.&quot; The story was trite and cliche'... I actually felt insulted that the director thought I might be stupid enough to buy into this ridiculous crap. If you aren't a 13 year old girl don't go see this.",

    "review/summary": "Oh, because Cheers was taken",
    "review/text": "For the past 9 years I have harbored a secret desire to watch Coyote Ugly. I thought it would be extremely cheesy but that I would like it in spite of it all. A guilty pleasure. I expected to like it, like I enjoyed Flash Dance, Mystic Pizza with the debut of Julia Roberts, Bottoms Up with Paris Hilton and Jason Mewes, or Cocktail with Tom Cruise. I thought I would like it, but I didn't expect that I would like it as much as I did. Now I am wondering why I waited 9 years.Violet Sanford (Piper Pirabo) is a Pizza Waitress in New Jersey, but she dreams of moving to New York to be a Songwriter. Her mother wanted to be a singer, too, but gave it up to marry Violet's dad (John Goodman). He is a toll collector, and he depends on her a lot, now that his wife has passed away. He can't stop her from pursuing her dream, even though he'd prefer that she stayed in Jersey.Once she has moved to New York, she finds that it is tough making a living, and ends up working at a rough bar called Coyote Ugly, where the bartenders, all female, dance on the bar, and keep up a rowdy atmosphere that packs the joint nightly. What kind of drinks do they serve there?----------------------------------Customer: So, basically you have...?Lil: Jim, Jack, Johnny Red, Johnny Black, and Jose; all my favorite men. You can have it any way you like it, as long as it's in a shot glass.==========================================At first Violet/Jersey has a really rough time of it, but Lil, the owner, thinks her fresh innocent look will make up for what she lacks in experience:-------------------------------Lil: Hey, everybody, shut up! I'd like you to meet my new girl, whose name is... Jersey! Jersey, is an ex kindergarten teacher, and a former nun, who just escaped from the convent, and is tired of being the only virgin in New York City! Would anyone like to buy her a drink?===========================================Not surprisingly, quite a few want to have that privilege. After a while she fits right in, but still she wonders why the strange name?---------------------Girl: Can I ask you somethin'?Lil: What?Girl: What - Oh, what does Coyote Ugly mean?Lil: Did you ever wake up sober after a one night stand, and the person you're next to is layin' on your arm, and they're so ugly, you'd rather chew off your arm then risk waking 'em? That's coyote ugly.Girl: My God. But, why would you name your bar after somethin' like that?Lil: Oh, because Cheers was taken.=============================================Meanwhile she is making the rounds with her demo tapes and goes to another bar where the bartender tells her that Mr. O'Donnell (Adam Garcia), who is really a cook, is in charge of booking. He plays along until his boss blows his cover, and then, though he got off on the wrong foot, he keeps trying to win her over. One guess if he ever does. She is also having a hard time overcoming her stage fright, but finds that the only way to get her songs heard is to perform at the open mic. Wonder if she ever gets over that stage fright?Coyote Ugly takes what is a clich&eacute; as a story, but it is done very well. The Coyotes put on quite a show, and the dance numbers and routines in the bar are really the highlight of the film. One of the dancers, Zo, is played by Tyra Banks, who does her best Naomi Campbell impersonation. Coyote Ugly is always just on the verge of a huge bar room brawl. Piper Pirabo is really great in the lead, like Jennifer Beals in Flashdance, or Julia Roberts in Mystic Pizza. She looks a lot like Carly Simon, with a luscious full set of lips. She is really quite a pretty face, but her acting wasn't too shabby, either. I am surprised that she is not an even bigger star.Adam Garcia, as the grill cook/boyfriend, was more than adequate to the task. He is an Australian with a background in dance, and at first his career seemed to be following in John Travolta's footsteps, with parts in Australian productions of Saturday Night Fever and Grease. Luckily, his character, Kevin O'Donnell, is supposed to be from Australia, too. He has played opposite Lindsay Lohan in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and Drew Barrymore in Riding in Cars With Boys. In Ugly, his character went beyond the basic requirements for a cute boyfriend and had a few quirks. He was a comic book collector, and trades his most prized possession, a rare Spider-man comic, for an audition for Violet. Kevin Smith (Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Chasing Amy) actually did some unaccredited work on the script, but surprisingly, though he is an avid comic collector who sold his collection to finance his early films, and then bought them back as soon as he could afford to, he didn't come up with the idea to make O'Donnell a comic collector.Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who surprised writer Gina Wendkos because that is not his usual shtick, Ugly features Johnny Knoxville (Jackass), Ellen Cleghorne (Saturday Night Live), and Bud Cort (Harold & Maude) in cameos.One aspect of Coyote Ugly that I enjoyed was the music, though the music that Violet writes, Piper Pirabo auditioning or performing the songs that she \"wrote,\" was nothing to write home about. In spite of her not really knocking me out with her singing talent, I identified with her quest, being a denizen of the open mic scene myself. She somehow managed to turn a diagnosis of the symptoms of Stage Frightus Majorious into a cute seduction scene that I forgave for its silliness for obvious reasons. There was some good music on the soundtrack. There is a song by Joe Strummer and The Mescalaros, a little INXS, some Blondie, Kid Rock, The Georgia Satellites, Reverend Horton Heat, Third Eye Blind, The Stray Cats, Billy Idol, and LeAnn Rimes even shows up as a new Coyote near the end and does a tune. LeAnn is also dubbed in when Piper is singing, but they just didn't have that great of material for her to do. I would much rather hear LeAnn's rhymes on the Patsy Cline style \"Blue\" or some hard core Country than to have her waste her pipes on the watered down pop Piper was doing. Still, the soundtrack album did remain in the Billboard Top 40 for more than a year.Coyote Ugly? More like Coyote Lovely!Piper PiraboBeverly Hills Chihuahua(2008) ....

    "review/text": "\"Coyote Ugly\" is an interesting movie that falls more into the lines of a teenager type love story than what I had originally thought it would be. Billed as an \"intoxicating sexy comedy\" from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, this movie more or less falls short of that billing in that it relies more heavily on the \"girl with a long shot makes it big\" theme that has been highly prevalent in previous movies, leaving one with the overwhelming impression of been there, seen that.Performance wise; stars such as Piper Parabo, John Goodman and Maria Bello all do a great job with the script they had. I'm more or less surprised that Maria Bello hasn't become a bigger star as she definitely has it in her and she's an incredibly beautiful woman.This is the only movie from director David McNally II that I've seen so far and it would be hard to make a definitive judgment on his movie making talents based on this one movie that I didn't find particularly wonderful. Hopefully down the road he'll find a better script to work with.The Premise:As stated above, this is a teenager type movie about Violet (Piper Parabo) who moves from rural New York to the Big Apple to make it big as a song writer. Along the way she encounters the standard fare of difficulties of trying to get into that business and finds that she must take on a job at a bar known as the \"Coyote Ugly\" to try to make ends meet until she can get that \"one big break.\"Overall, I'd say this is an interesting rental more than anything else. {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Additional Scenes Not Seen In Theaters-Behind The Scenes Featurettes*Coyote 101*How To Be A Coyote*Inside The Songs*Search For The Stars-LeAnn Rimes Music Video-Audio Commentary With Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Director David McNally And The Coyotes-\"Action Overload\" Reel Featuring the Hottest Moments From The Movie - Music Video-Style",

About the time the heroine and hero are doing the teen aged ga-ga thing and uttering mind numbing trivia to each other, and my GF is making motions like she is going to heave into her popcorn, I glanced over at the row of teenaged girls next to us - they were enraptured!As I said.... Great film if you're under 16 !Unlike one of the other reviewers who noted all the idiocy going on in the bar (like the overpouring which is both illegal and irresponsible), I will dismiss this as aimed directly at a teenaged audience without a shred of real world experience (I owned a large bar and saloon), and thus literary license.I gave it ONE star for TWO reasons: The first is ... rate it with negative stars..... and the second is that there was some genuine stompin' music....

The plot is entirely predicable, and all the characters (how did they do that?) remain without any depth.

He finally agrees to bankroll the project on the condition that she turns over all actual production decisions to a competent production company. The production group casts a pair of likable actors and get John Goodman to play a supporting role. They target the Britney segment of the Lifetime movie audience with a teen angst/struggling artist story-line. They also go after a large secondary audience-those (of both sexes) who like to watch hot women in tight pants. They have a large enough budget to staff the project with an excellent crew although they skimp on production design, supporting cast talent, and editing. They make a movie called Coyote Ugly and successfully market it to their target audiences. If you are part of their secondary target audience it is best to watch it on DVD so you can avoid any scenes devoid of tight pants.Problem--Nothing happens. This story is so tired only the worn down father of the screenwriter would dream of making it into a movie, and just on the long shot that his daughter would move out of the house and get a real job once she had a writing credit on her resume. The Olsen twins, credited as someone named Piper Perabo; play Violet, a young songwriter who makes the BIG journey all the way from New Jersey to New York City to realize her dream. Olsen Twin Violet has stage fright but immediately meets the nicest boy in NYC - an Australian (played by Adam Garcia) who collects comic books, thinks he saw her in a television show with Lori Loughlin, works an assortment of entry-level jobs, and still has time to truly care about her.

    "review/text": "Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have an innate sense of what makes money in cinema. He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years (American Gigolo, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon). Bruckheimer is a populist producer. He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance. In that regard, \"Coyote Ugly\" fits right in.This film is energetic, entertaining, scintillating and fun to watch. The story is &quot;Flashdance&quot; lite, and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous \"Cocktail\" with Tom Cruise, only with a decent plot woven in. Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy, New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered. When things don't go as planned, she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below. Of course, there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame, completing the populist formula.Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director. Other than John Goodman in a minor role, and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting, most of the actors have extremely short resumes. This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.Piper Perabo is an incredible find. She is not simply acting in this film, but living the role. Just like her character Violet, this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit (another stroke of Bruckheimer genius). Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential. It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career. Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil, the tough and successful owner of the nightclub. Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest. His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson, although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial. John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film. It also includes a DTS audio option, which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1. The soundtrack is pulsating and explosive and pumps the film up with excitement.This is not great filmmaking, but it is great entertainment. It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch. I rated it a 7/10. Many people were surprised by how much they enjoyed it, but I'm never surprised when I like a Jerry Bruckheimer film. He knows how to push our buttons.",

Oh, and all those sexy models--like devistatingly beautiful Tyra Banks--too call to the males like syrens. And there's the romantic interest for us ladies. So why isn't this fun or interesting? Because nothing about this movie is believable. There's nothing fun about this movie or romantic. When Piper Perabo opens her mouth to sing, fulfilling her life-long dream, we're to think a star is born, instead, I found myself rolling my eyes and joining the other ladies in the theatre as they all turn to their date--who are too busy drooling over attractive Perabo--and give a look that says How Incredibly Cheesy! Unfortunately, my boyfriend bought this DVD--God help him, he's attracted to Piper Parabo-like girls (which is why he's dating me, I suppose) and is not disappointed by it's lackluster features--a little featurette here and there about the making of this dud, so forth.

The unrated version unfortunately spoils the balance a bit by throwing in bits of nudity. Do you really want that in a sugary date flick? Probably not.

I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie.

    "review/text": "What brought me into watching Coyote Ugly? Exactly what it promoted. Nice looking girls dancing atop a bar to nice songs. But there's so much more to Coyote Ugly than that! Although there are enough entertaining bar dancing scenes to satisfy anyone. Coyote Ugly tells the story of Violet Sanford, an aspiring songwriter who moves to New York City -- away from her protective father -- to pursue her career. While living in a trashy apartment, she is robbed of almost everything she owns, and is quick to find a job. She finds one at Coyote Ugly, one of the hottest bars in NYC. Yet, she finds that serving at this bar is a bit difficult. You also have to dance and entertain. Among the chaos of Coyote Ugly, Violet meets a young man, and a romance is developed. The antics at the bar, Violet's search for fame, her budding romance, and some downtimes make for a nice, comfy blend of drama and comedy. Actually, the mix of drama and comedy is just right and suits the pace of the film fairly well. As there is hardly a dull moment.Piper Perabo stars as Voilet Sanford. Perabo was awesome in this movie, as she perfected at pulling off Violet's innocent yet strong-willed personality. Adam Garcia plays Violet's love interest, and gives enough charm and wit to make his character interesting and likable. John Goodman is here as Violet's father, and has some pretty good moments. Preferably at the end. The Coyote girls were all excellent in their parts. Even though they were sort of stereotyped nothing ever fell out of place. And don't think that Tyra Banks has a big part here. Her onscreen time is probably less than 10 minutes. But she shines when she's there.With it's perfect blend of comedy, drama, good performances, and fun bar scenes - Coyote Ugly is a perfect feel good, inspiring movie.",

For me, this and &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; are those movies. What makes Coyote Ugly so special? To be honest, everything. When I went to see in in theatres, I was expecting it to turn out a fun party movie for the guys to enjoy, and for us girls to laugh at. Instead, I found the most likable romance-comedy I've ever seen. It was marketed all wrong. Everything about this movie is perfect. Piper Perabo is my favorite actress to date, despite having done little film work before Coyote Ugly, and with a few projects in the works. There's something in her voice that makes every word out of her mouth believable. Adam Garcia is the sexist man I've ever seen in movies or music, hands down. To top it all off, he has an Aussie accent. (Is there ANYTHING sexier?) He's a dancer before an actor, but I don't care how well he dances, he was born to act and I hopt to see more of him as soon as I can. Ignoring the fact that both my favorite actress and favorite actor are in this movie, the plot and script could practically not have been imporved on. This is a feel-good movie, and the ending is a typical one for a romance, but the characters are so easy to attach to that no other ending would have been satisfying. Even though you might not love the movie to point I do, If you want romance, comedy, or even just to see girls in skimpy clothing do a table dance, you'll see it all here. Don't bother to rent it, put that 3 bucks towards buying it. See that botton that says &quot;Add to cart?&quot; Click it.",

    "review/summary": "Coy, prudish recycling of 'Flashdance'",
    "review/text": "Many who watch Coyote Ugly will find themselves feeling the story is very familiar. There are some good reasons for that. One is that Jerry Bruckheimer, one of the most successful producers of all time, insists that his movies be done by the numbers. As a result, while most people in the business are envious of his financial success, you'll rarely find him grabbing awards on Oscar night. Mr. Bruckheimer is also a firm believer in recycling. Sixteen years ago, he produced a big hit called Flashdance, in which a determined and beautiful girl worked as a dancer in a fancy bar until she was able to become a dancer in the theater. In Coyote Ugly a girl so similar as to be a clone works as a dancer and bartender in a huge bar until she can make it as a songwriter. In both movies, the girl is mentored into stardom by a handsome young man because, I suppose, we are still saddled by the odd notion that, not only can a woman not make it without a man, she has to sleep with him, too. I am certain that Mr. Bruckheimer would claim that the guy is still around to give a movie dramatic appeal, but I would argue that it says that the more things change, the more they remain the same in Hollywood.Violet Sanford [Piper Perabo] moves to New York City from New Jersey. Dad [John Goodman] doesn't approve, but this being a by the numbers movie, we all know from the start that he'll come around. In New York, Violet takes cassettes of her songs around to the big music companies. They virtually throw her out on her ear. One night a tape winds up in the hands of a charming cook named Kevin [Adam Garcia], and he realizes what we know even though we haven't yet heard the songs: Violet is a super talented writer. Meanwhile, she lands a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly. In this establishment premium liquor is sold in shot glasses. That's all they sell. When the girls aren't too busy pouring shots or spraying customers who ask for water in the face with the same, they get up on the bar and dance. The crowd goes wild. This is the kind of place that only exists in a movie.Coyote Ugly has in its favor a very high energy level and a very pretty cast. It has a great many familiar songs, mostly from the 80s, in it, thus assuring brisk soundtrack sales. Its original songs, unfortunately, are unlikely to still be being played in the 2020s. Perabo is a charming and talented actress, and better parts are bound to come her way. For her, this movie is merely a stepping stone.Bruckheimer is a pro at sniffing out the winds of change, and he knew that the summer of 2000 would be one in which the 'PG-13' rating would rule. This was not due to Hollywood's sudden taking of the moral high ground. It was due to saber rattling coming from Washington and to the fact that Hollywood's core audience is now so young that many of its member aren't supposed to be able to buy tickets to 'R' rated fare. The result of Bruckehiemer's having copped out is that Coyote Ugly, which by it's very nature should have been 'R' rated, comes off as coy and prudish. There are many times when we want to say 'for shame' to producers whose use of gratuituous sex and violence earns their movies an 'R' rating. Still, there are times when it is somehow dishonest NOT to go the restricted route, and Coyote Ugly is a good example.",

You might think that having those bodies and those faces, it would help the weak storyline. But if you're only looking for sexy women... well, these are HOT, but they never get naked, they really don't show much. If that was the high poing of the movie, it didn't work out.But I want to make myself clear: I don't think a movie is good just because there's explicit sex or nudity.

I'll just say that for any of you who's ever had a dream this is one inspiring movie, a must see on any ones list!!!",

The plot of the movie is really fun and interesting to watch as the young Violet works towards her dream. There were a few unrealistic aspects of this movie but overall a great and worthwhile flick. The Australian guy was a scene stealer and made the movie worth watching for the women out there. I definately would recommend seeing this movie. My boyfriend thinks of it as a chick flick, but didn't mind watching the bar girls. Go figure.",

She just movie to the &quot;Big Apple&quot; from a local small town and is desperate for work. She is a struggling song writer dealing with issues about singing her work. She needs money and is getting desperate. Enter the bar Coyote Ugly. From there on we watch a Cocktailish movie with stars like Tyra Banks, Maria Bello, and Melanie Lynskey call the shots.

    "review/text": "This is one of those titles that I find difficult to review. I don't hate \"Coyote Ugly\" but I'm not exactly liking it all the same, and that's the basis of my opinion. If you want to see girls having a wild and crazy time or you're the type of eccentric person who wanted something feisty to watch with friends on popcorn night, you'll probably enjoy this movie. This movie is loud, claustrophobic, and out-of-control, if this what occurs in the real Coyote Ugly location, then I got wonder about the safety hazards if girls can dance on barstills and lit the still on fire and dance on it like a tribsman. Of course, it could all be exaggerated for the sake of movie magic.Naming the Coyotes at heart, the leader of the pack is Lili (Maria Bello), a character I kinda like because she's direct while being level-headed, which granted is what a leader is suppose to be. Zoe (Tyra Banks), gets the distinction of not appearing as often as the other girls. Rachel is the self-proclaimed b-word although she's quite modest for what she is, and Cammie is the flirty type, which at least that girl lived up to her status; these two shared a special distinction of not knowing who they are before looking it up on IMDb, and even then I forgot their names. The final Coyote is the newbie and main protagonist, Violet (Piper Perabo), who got out of the Jersey to be an aspiring songwriter in New York, which failed attempts, broken dreams and meeting her love interest led to her discovering the bar and joining in. Violet bugs me, her sweet and innocent attitude comes as rather phony, and she's not exactly hard to please. When she met her love interest, she played the \"You're not what I'm looking for, get away from me, creepy\" gag for only a few minutes before she let that guy easily get into her heart and her 'cage'. The romantic sub-plot between those two was cheesy and patchy, almost contrived, but I know some people eat this stuff up from \"Gossip Girl\" or \"Laguna Beach\" so this aspect is of acquired taste...of low expectations.Since I saw the unrated version and never the original, I have some thoughts on what I think are added scenes. One scene has Violet exposing her chest during a love-making scene; visible boobs is enough to know it's an added scene and I don't think the scene had to be extended just for that, and plus, why Violet's boobs and not Lili's boobs (just as a preference)? Another scene has the Coyotes compete in a baseball match, and Cammie stripped while on batting to ogle her competition. She only exposed her bra and panties, but I had to think this is added for this version, but the entire scene revolved around pointless, almost insulting eye-candy.Calling \"Coyote Ugly\" shameless is rather apt. All these girls are just strutting their stuff, and though they keep the movie exciting, I eventually got sick of their promiscuity. It's a case of 'too much of a good thing', and besides almost of the gals are really that interesting. But the movie knows what it wants to show, so it's not bad or good. It just is.",

    "review/text": "I know that the movie is kind of (okay, a lot of) stupid, but there is something about this movie that I really like. Oh, yeah, that would be the likes of Piper Perabo, Izabella Miko and Bridget Moynahan scantily clad, dancing on a bar with booze. Yeah, that's what I like so much about this movie.The plot behind `Coyote Ugly' is rather predictable and generic. Violet wants to be a big music star but she has to fight her nerves to finally get noticed. She shops around her demo tapes but that's kind of pointless. When she's finally destitute she starts bartending at this crazy bar where girls act like strippers for major tips. She's green, and pretty bad at it, but she's hot and so the owner (a pretty grounded and authentic Maria Bello) allows her to flub up as long as she keeps trying, and she does, and supposedly dancing on tables gave her the courage to face her biggest fears and just sing her heart out.Well, her boyfriend has to turn off the lights first.Like I said, this film is rather stupid, but it embraces that stupidity and makes up for it with layers and layers of fun. The sensuality is all over the place, in a good way. The film totally capitalizes on the draw of the actresses (I'm so glad that Jessica Simpson didn't get Perabo's role, but I'm saddened that this was basically the beginning and end of Perabo) and uses their bodies to an extreme.If you've never been to a Coyote Ugly, I urge you to make the trip; it's fun!Bello and Perabo and Goodman actually pull in really nice performances here. Moynahan and Miko don't have a lot to do outside of be really hot, and they master that (especially Miko), so job well done. Adam Garcia is pretty bad here. I wish that Melanie Lynskey could get more work. I love her, and she is SOOO talented (watch `Heavenly Creatures', NOW!). She has yet another thankless supporting role here. Why is it that the less conventionally attractive girls get shafted in this industry?Tyra Banks makes me laugh, but not because of this movie.All in all, I totally recommend this movie. I mean, it's a ton of fun, and you can't go wrong with honky tonk, stripper action in bars (and the whole meaning behind the bars name is just genius).",

Does anyone care about Skills and his girlfriend Lauren, or Mouth and his job? And YET again, Nathan and Haley's marriage is on shaky ground. Everything seems recycled. Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season. The only reason I will watch season 8 is because of Clay, and because I've been watching since the beginning. The show should have ended after season 6.",

    "review/text": "One Tree Hill, Season 7.This has been my favourite season so far. The introduction of the new characters gave the tv series a new vibe that I loved, but still in the same style as the previous six seasons. However I did miss Lucas and Peyton very much and felt that they needed to be part of some storylines throughout the season, especally with Brooke. Brooke was there for Peyton when she was in a rough patch and that made their friendsip special and realistic, but when Brooke was going through tough times this season there was not even a phone call from Peyton. So that annoyed me that the writers couldn't add just that little bit in. The new characters fit in well and the storylines fit too. Clay has to be my favourite addition. He has the best back ground very interesting and entertaining, not to mention Very good looking. My least favourite is Alex (girl) she is too soppy and it makes the show drag in parts. I loved the story line with Haley and her mum, it was very moving. I think that I cried for 3 episodes straight. I think that the writers did an excellent job and the directors and film crew as usual did fantastic work! The bonus features were excellent to watch also. The ending to the season was extremely exciting and i cannot wait for season 8 Living in Australia, I am very glad to have bought this from amazon as it is not avaliable in stores here. I also bought seasons 5 and 6 from amazon and I am very happy with the service that I recieved, I recomend it to everyone! I will be waiting for season 8 to become avaliable and will be ordering it as soon as it does!!One Tree Hill: The Complete Seventh Season",

But my friend wanted to watch it but mentioned how she could afford to buy it and my wheels started turning trying to think of a way to get it. I found it for about 27 new! It came faster then expected and was new unopened except the side of the case where you open had been cracked i wasn't sure if it was like that before shipped or happened in the shipping process. Besides that minor set back she loved her present and was very surprised! Oh and a good thing about buying it for a friend is you get to burrow it when they are done! I've almost re watched it all and even saw a few episodes i missed! I love Jamie in all the episodes and the episode where The girls eat special brownies was LOL funny. Good product good buy!",

I watched and re-watched my seasons 1 through 6 when ever I am in the mood to see some of my favorite characters on tv. Knowing that Chad And Hilarie were not coming back I was very disappointed that they were not staying on. Seeing that I have DVR I recored every episode. I watched the first three episode and stoped watching them because I felt it was forcing new character on me. Just because 14 months pass and you are showing Nathan all BFF with his agent does not mean that we automatically have to like him or any of the other new characters. My sister watched most of the episode and she would tell me what was going on and I almost gave up on my show. But I told my self I would seat and watch it for my self. I loved my couple Nathan and Haley, Brooke and Julian. I focused more on them and just tried to not pay to much to what Mark and the writers were doing to character like Milli(there is no way the Mili from Season 5 would get strung out on drugs NO WAY)and who ever that women that was working in My Peyton's Red Bedroom Records. She was a waste of film and took time away from my favorite characters. By the end of the season I can say that I was surprised. It was not as corny and awful as my sister and said it was. I even warmed up a little to Clay and Quinn(eventhough the talented photographer was them filling the void left when peyton left)I will not buy this season becuase I can buy only certain episode that I like and the rest i can watch on Youtube. I will buy next season if Brooke get married and Peyton come to the wedding. No way in the world brooke gets married and her BFF in the whole wolrd is not there.",

This season was pitiful There were points that you laugh out loud from it being so stupid and corny. Nobody acts like they do and Jamie's character which was good in the 5th and 6th seasons has become stupid. The show isn't the same without Lucas and Peyton, it's just dumb. The writing is just terrible, worst show of the year. I've never seen anything so corny. The new characters are ok, but this show shouldn't be surviving without Lucas and Peyton because it is so pointless and stupid without them. Even without them, it's too bad the writers and producers couldn't make it interesting and dramatic. Instead it's full of games, messes, snowball fights, and stupidity. Don't waste your time or money. Try some of the shows like 90210, Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, and others which would be way more worth your time and money.",

Some new and lovable characters were introduced, some continuing storylines were followed, and a lot of the themes introduced/addressed were perfectly fitting for 20-somethings trying to make their lives work. The show and characters will make you laugh and cry, especially if you've been following them all along. And if you haven't and want to start now, this is a good place to start.

Brooke (Sophia Bush) continues her work at Clothes Over Bros, along with her mother, Victoria (Daphne Zuniga) whom she had just reconnected with at the end of season 6. She also deals with her bumpy romance with Julian (Austin Nichols) who becomes a regular this season. Haley (Bethany Joy Galeotti) dives back into her music career and Millicent (Lisa Goldstein) spirals out of control as the season progresses, ruining her relationship with Mouth (Lee Norris), who eventually begins a small romance with Lauren (Allison Munn) after Skills (Antwon Tanner) leaves town for a job. Finally, Dan (Paul Johannson) is now the host of his own talk show, with Rachel (Danneel Harris) as his wife. Newcomers include Alex (Jana Kramer), an actress who has her eyes on Julian. Also new in town are Clay (Robert Buckley), Nathan's agent and Quinn (Shantel Vansanten), Haley's sister, who's just left her husband and has a passion for photography, Miranda (India de Beaufort) Haley's new sassy manager and Grubbs, the new bartender at Tric with a secret talent that has nothing to do with mixing drinks.Other guest stars during the season include Taylor James (Lindsey Mckeon), who first appeared in season 2, as well as Kate Voegele, Stephen Colleti, Bess Armstrong (Haley's mother), Mitch Ryan (Brooke's model, Alex), Gregory Harrison and Amanda Schull (as Clay's wife & stalker tennis player Katie).All in all, the season stays true to the show and continues to impress with fresh, funny and many times emotional and dramatic storylines that made the show the hit it is.Don't miss out on this season. Even though Hil and Chad are gone, it's still staying strong without them.",

Not saying that certain storylines didn't annoy me or bother me at one time or another. but i had that in any season. not just this one. I thought the whole dan storyline in the beginning was alittle pushed and I didn't like the way they tarnished Rachel's charactor. But overall, it remained a strong show in season seven. Still had great storylines. and it earned season 8. if they day comes when it's not producing good storylines. then it should be cancelled. but until then, give the show it's props. it deserves to be on air.",

Who wants the same story lines anyway?? I know I don't. This probably wasn't their best season but they did come back strong with out 2 of their main cast.The Season Finale probably did make this whole season. I felt after seeing the finale there's hope for a season 8 and possibly more seasons to come. (I hope)I'm definitely gonna buy this season!!",

    "review/text": "The President's Manwasn't a very good movie. It more or less seemed like the filmmakers slapped together a lazy script with Americana overtones and then begged Chuck Norris on bended knee to co-star. \"A Line in the Sand\" here isn't a great movie, either, but it gets points just for being better than its predecessor. It's a post-9/11 film with an agenda, but at least it *has* an agenda: it feels more directed and in the vein of classic B-movie action than its aimless prequel. For this alone, it deserves recognition as one of the last few decent Chuck Norris pictures...but how much this says about a movie is up to your discretion.The story: when an Islamic Jihadist (Joel Swetow,Charmed) threatens to detonate a nuclear device in Texas, it's up to \"the president's men\" - a returning Deke Slater and Joshua McCord (Judson Mills and Norris,Walker, Texas Ranger) to capture him before his plan is set in motion.I prefer Judson Mills as Chuck Norris' sidekick over Dylan Neal from the first film: Neals' depiction of the same character was moodier and more layered, but Mills actually makes Deke likable and gives a better martial performance when it comes to the fight scenes. These too have improved over their predecessors from two years prior - now incorporating acrobatic maneuvers like a somersault axe kick and a Hong Kong-esque move wherein Deke grabs an opponent's arms and corkscrews him into the air - but sadly are still fairly infrequent. Jennifer Tung (\"Masked Rider\") as Joshua's daughter and team strategist sees her role being dumbed down a bit, but she makes up for it with a worthy sparring session with Mills, including a competent demonstration of the steel whip. Chuck Norris still more or less just plays himself, and that's good enough at this stage of his career.As far as the film's thematic elements go, I have to admit that I'm kind of surprised. I'm not sure how much - if anything - of this film's plot or production was changed after 9/11, but even though the story is more or less a nationalistic fantasy of how the United States will capture Osama bin Laden (it involves a jetpack), the famously conservative Norris plays it startlingly middle-of-the-road, going out of his way to discourage violence against Islamists in general and pointing out the smallness of religious extremism among the population. Keep in mind that this is the same man who spent his golden years of film beating up people who refer to Allah and/or proclaim hate for America, and you'll be as surprised as me. Nevertheless, the movie is pretty one-sided as to how it presents Arabs, including naturalized citizens of America (save for one very mean lawyer), and in general feels like a propaganda piece. Endurable propaganda, on account of the action, but propaganda nonetheless.The film is a bit more ambitious than its predecessor in what it wants to show, and therein stumbles production-wise. Aircraft and ship scenes are 100% stock or news footage, and an onscreen explosion looks particularly fake. Geographical snafus are abound for those who know what to look for. Less important but equally embarrassing is a poster introducing an in-movie museum exhibition which features a rather glaring grammatical error. Things like this tax this nonsensical movie more than they perhaps should, but they're probably not going to break the film if you've already made up your mind about it. Moderate Chuck Norris fans can choose to be picky, but the hardcore faithful ought to appreciate it despite its faults. It scrapes a passing grade on account of its enthusiasm, not its philosophy or technical achievements.",

Aided by his comely Eurasian daughter, JENNIFER TUNG, the boys use some pretty preposterous methods to stop the threat. It's all testosterone, patriotic propaganda, but it works due to the charm of the performers and our inherent fear after the 9/11 attacks.",

Chuck Norris seems to have forgotten that Afganistan is a landlocked country! The flag-waving (for both America and the great state of Texas) is hilarious.

    "review/text": "JULIA (1977) is a great movie, beautifully adapted from Lillian Hellman's story by Alvin Sargent, exquisitely directed by Fred Zinnemann and boasting a cast of fine actors, including Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Robards, Hal Holbrook, Rosemary Murphy, Maximilian Schell and, in her film debut, Meryl Streep.The film earned eleven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Redgrave, Robards and Sargent won their statuettes.Fonda plays Hellman, who in the early 1930s was an angry, struggling wannabe playwright, living with mystery writer Dashiell Hammett (Robards). With success still eluding her, she travels to Europe, hoping to find a better atmosphere in which to write, and also to visit with her oldest and dearest friend, Julia (Redgrave), daughter of a very wealthy family who is studying medicine in Vienna.Julia is also involved in an anti-Fascist/anti-Nazi movement, which has resulted in her being badly injured. In fact, after Hellman visits her in the hospital, she disappears. Years later, after she has become a Broadway success, Lillian is asked by Julia, via a political acquaintance (Schell), to undertake a dangerous clandestine mission against the Nazis.Though much of it may be fiction, JULIA is a gripping, moving, often suspenseful drama that stays with viewers long after it has ended. It's one of this writer's very favorite films.Michael B. Druxman",

It is very gentle, a bit feminine, more about feelings than action, still a very interesting.The actors, especially Jane Fonda and beautiful Vanessa Redgrave are amazing! I loved the scenery. I loved the girls who played Julia and Lilly as young girls. They were so charming and pure.There was something unique about the friendship of these women but I also could identify with both of them.Vanessa Redgrave played herself, since she is a political and social activist. This helped her to be very natural.Lilly (Julia) was also very real with her devotion to the friend but also fear of the consequences.I loved the film, I loved the main plot and all these extra twists caused by the impending war. I was born in Poland and I know how war can affect people's life in all aspects.",

    "review/text": "Having been much taken with \"Julia\" upon its release in 1977, I was curious if I would be so enthralled by it over thirty years later. It holds up very well indeed. Starring Jane Fonda as the writer Lillian Hellman and directed by Fred Zinnemann (\"A Man for All Seasons\") it is based on a story taken supposedly from Hellman's memoir PENTIMENTO although Reynolds Price in his latest memoir ARDEN SPIRITS accuses Hellman of \"purloining\" incidents from the life of Muriel Gardiner Buttinger. At any rate the story of what happens to Julia (Vanessa Redgrave) and her fight against fascism in the 1930's makes for high drama of the first order. Both Redgrave and Jason Robards, who plays Dash Hammett, Hellman's lover, both received Oscars for their performances. Maximilian Schell and Hal Holbrook have minor roles, and Meryl Streep has a few lines as well. This seems to me to be Jane Fonda at her best-- she looks terribly young and beautiful-- before she started playing herself as so often happens to actors as they get older. Certainly she is in good company here: think Katharine Hepburn and Jack Nicholson as two examples. Oh, and Redgrave, never one to shun controversy, is just as famous-- or infamous, depending on your point of view-- for her \"Zionist\" remarks in her Oscar acceptance speech as she is for this very fine performance.The film opens and closes with the same peaceful scene with voice over from Hellman's memoir. A really fine movie indeed.",

    "review/text": "Too bad this one's out of stock, but worse was that the poltical backlash Vanessa Redgrave's Best Supporting Actress acceptance speech detracted from the film's importance. Despite that, \"Julia\" may well be the best work in Redgrave's and Jane Fonda's impressive bodies of work. For the latter, the film launched the socially-themed works that followed, and Fonda may well have come of age in this one. She plays writer Lillian Hellman to Redgrave's title character, an upper-class rich kid who grows into social activist and lays her life on the line to smuggle condemned Jews from the death camps of Hitler's Third Reich. Redgrave is superlative, and Fonda is rivting as Julia's childhood friend who gradually comes to recognize the evil unleashed by man on man at the time. As Julia's long-time lover, Dashell Hammitt, the late Jason Robards nailed down one of his back-to-back Supporting Actor Oscars (\"All the President's Men\" was the other), and the raw talent of the Fonda-Redgrave-Robards package helps make \"Julia\" one of Fonda's best works. The importance of the film's subject matter is so overwhelming that it easily displaces the Vietnam-related controvery that dogged (and may still) Fonda through the '70s and the unpopular words Redgrave used in her Oscar acceptance speech (she was literally booed off the stage). Far from a \"chick flic,\" \"Julia\" is an important film that delves into but one relam in the darkest of human history, and it's earned a lofty spot among films of its genre.",

    "review/text": "Fred Zimmerman's 1977 film based on one of the sections of Lillian Hellman's memoir PENTIMENTO has not aged so well, despite some lovely compositions and the undeniable star power of Jane Fonda as Lillian Hellman, Jason Robards as her lover Dashiell Hammett, and Vanessa Redgrave as the titular heroine, a wealthy young woman who was Lillian's best friend in childhood and has grown up to fight injustice in general and the Nazis in particular. The film was made with Hellman's assistance (that's the real Hellman in the rowboat fishing in the framing shots), and you can see why almost immediately. Both Lillian and Julia are basically enshrined in the film as ideal heroines, brave, brilliant, beautiful, and resolutely heterosexual. (Fonda decks John Glover for implying she and Julia are lesbians in one scene that seems specifically included to forestall the audience getting any funny ideas.) There's not much plot except for a long Ambleresque sequence where Hellman is sent into Germany to smuggle in money to bribe officials to save victims of the Nazis; it's much more interesting than the rest of the film, which mostly alternates scenes of the young Julia (the lovely Lisa Pelikan) being saintly alternating with Fonda sulking at the typewriter, trying to please Robards's hardbitten Hammett. There's been quite a bit of controversy whether Julia ever existed, whether she's a composite of women Hellman knew, or whether she was the famous psychiatrist Muriel Gardiner who shared a lawyer with Hellman (but whom Hellman herself never actually knew).",

Jane Fonda is somewhat one-note as Hellmann, struggling to get her first play finished, feeling overshadowed by her lover, the great Dashiell Hammett, well played by Jason Robards. She also tries to keep contact with Julia, played by a glowing Vanessa Redgrave, as Julia becomes more and more mired in the tumultuous politics of 1930's Europe. Eventually, Fonda herself gets pulled into the political upheaval as she tries to help her friend out. There are a number of reasons why I liked the film. The production team does an excellent job of recreating the time period, giving the viewer a real sense of what it would have been like. I enjoyed the insight it gives to the writer's process and the frustrations that go with it. The &quot;adventure&quot; that Fonda goes on to get money to her friend is well played out dramatically, and their meeting is filled with unspoken words, a credit to the screenplay, the actresses, and the fine direction by veteran Fred Zinneman. I don't know how much of the story would prove to be true, but I think there are many truths in it.",

And fabricated but radiant Julia is played by true and radiant Vanessa Redgrave. There are some corny, cliche &quot;struggling artist&quot; scenes, like Hellman tossing her typewriter out the window to show how hard it is to be a writer, but then there are some scenes that elicit goosebumps--like a a simple shot of Redgrave walking among the Gothic spires of Oxford with a Fonda voice-over to the effect: &quot;There is a time in a woman's life when everthing comes together and she'll never look better. That's what happened to Julia that year.&quot; By the end, with Julia murdered and her baby daughter vanished (how convenient for Hellman's self-agrandizing purposes) you start to feel like maybe the character of Julia was just a &quot;red herring&quot; to advance Hellman's story about her noble self. Guess what? (PS: Mr. Johann was played by the great Maximillian Shell, not the great Max von Sydow, as a previous post claims.)",

If anything, \"Julia\" has improved over the years, time having rendered the former controversies over the politics of Fonda and Redgrave and the truth or falsity of Hellman's narrative irrelevant.Every character in this film is finely delineated: Jane Fonda as the insecure chain-smoking author, Lillian; Vanessa Redgrave as her best friend in the title role [and the word \"luminous,\" with which several reviewers characterize Redgrave's performance, does not constitute hyperbole]; Jason Robards as Lilly's gruff but tender mentor and lover; Maximilian Schell as Julia's impoverished anti-fascist go-between; and the two actresses who play Lilly and Julia as young girls. All are superb.\"Julia\" is arguably one of the best espionage films ever produced in Hollywood. The image of a transcontinental train hurtling through the snow-blown night, just as the world is hurtling headlong into war, evokes danger and guarantees entertainment of the highest calibre. Many Oscar-winning films nowadays are well acted but so depressing that one might not want to view them a second time. \"Julia\" is a keeper, especially at Amazon's ridiculously low price.",

The attention to detail in costumes, set decorations, props, locations dazzle you and place you squarely in another time and place. The performances, particularly the intimate friendship between Fonda as Hellman and Redgrave as Julia, blow you away. Redgrave embodies this brilliant character with knowing subtlety; you get the feeling she is Julia to some degree, and probably is. The exploration of adult friendship in a time of peril finds its center in a well-crafted suspense story that only ever hints at real danger, yet it is the slow and deliberate revelations regarding Julia's fate that provide tension and heartbreak. This is a purposely artful film, with its share of indulgence, but each one works as a part of a lovely whole. And the world Helman created in her story -- with its rich characters, both real and imagined -- is created here with an evocative freshness. Like a memory you love to call upon, this movie works best in total silence, except perhaps rain falling outside. Let it take you away.",

    "review/text": "Too bad this one's out of stock, but worse was that the poltical backlash Vanessa Redgrave's Best Supporting Actress acceptance speech detracted from the film's importance. Despite that, \"Julia\" may well be the best work in Redgrave's and Jane Fonda's impressive bodies of work. For the latter, the film launched the socially-themed works that followed, and Fonda may well have come of age in this one. She plays writer Lillian Hellman to Redgrave's title character, an upper-class rich kid who grows into social activist and lays her life on the line to smuggle condemned Jews from the death camps of Hitler's Third Reich. Redgrave is superlative, and Fonda is rivting as Julia's childhood friend who gradually comes to recognize the evil unleashed by man on man at the time. As Julia's long-time lover, Dashell Hammitt, the late Jason Robards nailed down one of his back-to-back Supporting Actor Oscars (\"All the President's Men\" was the other), and the raw talent of the Fonda-Redgrave-Robards package helps make \"Julia\" one of Fonda's best works. The importance of the film's subject matter is so overwhelming that it easily displaces the Vietnam-related controvery that dogged (and may still) Fonda through the '70s and the unpopular words Redgrave used in her Oscar acceptance speech (she was literally booed off the stage). Far from a \"chick flic,\" \"Julia\" is an important film that delves into but one relam in the darkest of human history, and it's earned a lofty spot among films of its genre.",

Obviously, this is what inspired the Chapter....Julia... in her later book. So the story is probably true to the point where they charged the students...and the newspaper headline that follows. Scenes at the hospital were probably made up as her friend, Alice, died in the riots. The train trip was probably made up , but she did go to Moscow.The story of her life with Hammett is completely believable even though locations may have been changed. Her relationship with Dorothy Parker, and the trip to Paris....look to be true. The later part of the movie as to how she dealt with Julia's body could have well been true...but happened immediately after the Vienna riot.The part where Hammett says....\"You'd better tear that up..\" happened later in her life in regards to the play...\"The Autumn Garden\" and not in relation to her first play..\"The Children's Hour\".The movie, the story...very well done. Fonda, Redgrave, and Robarts...all excellent.If you really want to enjoy this movie. I suggest you do the following reading. Hellman's three books....plus her play ...\"The Children's Hour\". Read about Dorothy Parker, I believe there is a book \"The Life and Times of Dorothy Parker.\" I can not recall the title exactly. It's the times of the 30's that is really interesting to me and frames this story superbly.",

    "review/text": "Decades had passed before it was known that Hellman hoodwinked the literary public with her story of Julia in 1974. It is now known that the actual 'Julia' was a political activist named Muriel Gardiner. Hellman never knew Gardiner, nor did Hellman smuggle money into Germany, or look for Julia's missing child during the war. Visa documents state that Hellman was in Spain for the 3 year period that the Julia story was supposed to have happened. It is believed that Hellman heard about the original story of Gardiner from their mutual attorney in New York, who told Hellman about his remarkable client who smuggled money and passports into Germany to buy political prisioners their freedom at the onset of the war. Hellman took the fascinating story of Muriel Gardiner and wove it into her own false 'recollection' of the events and thus wrote 'Pentimento' as her own memiors, which of course was primarily a contrivence and fabrication. Many notable writers considered Hellman a fraud and liar, and this is but another account of her deception and incredulity. If you want to know the REAL story of \"Julia\" get a copy of Gardiner's autobiography 'Code Name Mary'. I got my copy through Amazon.Although Hellman's account of 'Julia' is mostly fiction held together with a few threads of truth, it is still a fascinating story and a beautifully made film. Fonda is utterly marvelous...it is one of her best works. In fact, the film 'Julia' is one of my top 3 all time favorites. You need to see the movie and then get the book \"Code Name Mary\" and decide for yourself!",

    "review/summary": "\"But I trust absolutely what I remember about Julia\"",
    "review/text": "In the autumn of 1977, after a severe lack in the last few years of strong, complex women's roles in films several promising movies were slated to open where the female(s) would be front and center. These included Anne Bancroft and Shirley MacLaine in \"The Turning Point\", Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek in \"3 Women\", Marsha Mason in \"The Goodbye Girl\" and Diane Keaton in \"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\". However probably the most eagerly anticipated of them all was Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave in \"Julia\". Not only was this to be Fonda's comeback Hollywood film, after her self-imposed exile and political blacklisting, but also there was avid curiosity to see these two notorious political firebrands playing radical women of the 1930's. People wanted to see if art would mirror life.As the film opens, it's early morning and there is a solitary figure sitting in a rowboat fishing on a mist-shrouded lake. She is Lillian Hellman (Jane Fonda), the renowned playwright and author, now an aging woman. Her thoughts are expressed in an inner monologue as she revisits her life as a young woman and remembers the two strongest influences in molding and developing her character. They are her lover and literary mentor for many years, the esteemed writer Dashiell Hammett (Jason Robards), and her best friend from childhood, the beautiful, passionate, socially committed Julia (Vanessa Redgrave). The majority of the film is set in the early to late 1930's where Lillian's two complicated relationships with Julia and Hammett are intertwined. Hammett and Lillian live together in a cottage on Long Island Sound as she tries to write her first play, and he serves as editor and critic. Blocked, Lillian decides to take a sabbatical in Europe, intending to visit Julia there who is studying for a medical degree in Vienna, living in a sector that has socialist and left wing activists striving to create positive political change. However Julia is brutally beaten and injured in a fascist riot, Lillian visits her twice in the hospital but then Julia is removed to an unknown destination for additional surgery and rehabilitation. An extremely frustrated and concerned Lillian is unable to make contact with her, and reluctantly returns home. She reworks her play, \"The Children's Hour\", it is a smash hit on Broadway and she is the toast of the town. In 1937, Lillian takes another trip to Europe and tries to visit with Julia. In the lobby of her Paris hotel Lillian is approached by a nondescript middle-aged stranger who identifies himself as Johann (Maximilian Schell). He is a friend of Julia's and gives Lillian a letter from her. In it, Julia asks a critical favor of Lillian to smuggle $50,000 into Nazi Germany for her to use to bribe Nazis to release Jews and other political prisoners. Lillian will need to take a train that will let her off in Berlin where she will exchange the money with a courier. Although Julia warns Lillian not to do it if she truly feels she can't, that there will be no dishonor, after some soul searching she decides to take on this dangerous mission.Fonda is unqualifiedly marvelous as the legendary writer Lillian Hellman. She is like a tightly coiled spring, ready to snap, releasing an incendiary temper. Her body language is tense and contained, her guard continually up, and she seldom seems to relax fully except when she is with Julia. Yet, Fonda suggests the many currents channeled inside Hellman, the relentless drive to be the best, her fierce integrity and her honest, forthright character. Her Hellman is not always endearing, but she will earn your respect and ultimately admiration. She incorporates a quirky little gesture the real Hellman used, which is making the sign of the cross while saying \"Oi veh!' which adds a nice touch of authenticity. In addition Fonda uses a cigarette for a prop better than any actress since Bette Davis, and looks very sleek and stylish most of the time. This performance earned her a third Best Actress Oscar nomination, a Golden Globe, a British Film Academy Award and sealed her Hollywood comeback.As the title character Vanessa Redgrave doesn't come off quite as well. However, this is not her fault. Lillian Hellman's autobiography was entitled \"An Unfinished Woman\" and that exactly pinpoints the problem with the character of Julia both in Hellman's original \"Pentimento\" and Alvin Sargent's screenplay, she is an enigma, as ephemeral as a puff of smoke, too one sided and saintly, having no real flaws, and seems more like a symbol of nobility and justice rather than a flesh and blood woman. Redgrave is a luminous presence with a perfect American accent but really only has the opportunity to register strongly in her wordless scene in the hospital and especially in the meeting with Lillian in the Berlin caf&eacute;. This is hands down the best scene in the film and Fonda and she soar with it. These two scenes are what earned her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.The supporting cast is quite good, Jason Robards as the craggy, laconic Dashiell Hammett won his second Best Supporting Actor in a row. He and Fonda work much more fortuitously together than in their initial pairing eleven years earlier in the fluffy \"Any Wednesday\". Maximilian Schell in a cameo part as Johann makes such an impact that he was nominated as well for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. As the adolescent Julia and Lily, Lisa Pelikan and Susan Jones are well cast in terms of resemblance to Redgrave and Fonda. Rosemary Murphy (also an \"Any Wednesday alumna!) and Hal Holbrook are diverting as another noteworthy writer, Dorothy Parker and her husband Alan Campbell. Although I find Meryl Streep vastly overrated as an actress, for those that fancy her, she makes her film debut in a tiny part. Finally I do want to mention the veteran actress Cathleen Nesbitt who appears as Julia's grandmother, and clicks in her brief moments as a grande dame.In his next to last film master director Fred Zinnemann displays his usual meticulous craftsmanship and sensitivity. The script by Alvin Sargent is for the most part a skillful, literate adaption of Hellman's story, and he won an Oscar for his efforts. Great care and taste were evidenced in putting this film together, it's handsome, elegant, with a classic style as evidenced in the production design by Gene Callahan, Carmen Dillon and Willy Holt, and the costume design by Anthea Sylbert. The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe with exteriors in Oxford and Paris is outstanding as is the original musical score by George Delerue.Critically lauded for the most part, \"Julia\" performed quite well at the box office and was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including besides those mentioned above, nominations for Best Picture and Director. Now many years later it seems to have slipped somewhat out of favor, the only extra besides the subtitle options are its original trailer. Too bad Fonda and Redgrave didn't do a commentary; their insights into the film would have been interesting. Perhaps a possible reason might be when it was released \"Julia\" was advertised with the byline \"Based on a true story\". However now there is a high degree of skepticism of it's authenticity, despite Lillian Hellman' insistence that it all actually occurred as written. More probably, on some strong evidence that has been presented the chapter of \"Julia\" in her book \"Pentimento\" was most likely fiction based on a real life counterpart Muriel Gardiner, an American heiress working for the Austrian resistance during the initial Nazi occupation before the outbreak of World War II. Although they never met Hellman and she shared the same lawyer, and it is thought he told Hellman Gardiner's story, which had many parallels to Julia's. Regardless, it is worth a viewing for what may be the only chance to see two of the finest film actresses of their generation act together, plus see the final film success of renowned director Fred Zinnemann.",

Made in 1977 when WW2 was closer in time than Vietnam is now, the movie is a bit of a relic, but still worth watching. Jason Robards as Dashiell Hammett is a hoot.

    "review/text": "Occasionally, when I'm dashing off a review for amazon.com, I will try to adopt a less subjective, somewhat more professional style. Sometimes this is little more than a kind of writing exercise: sometimes it may be just because I've looked at some of my other reviews and seen (much to my own embarrassment) how often the pronoun \"I\" comes up. Who needs that?But then *I* think there really are some advantages to talking about film in a subjective mode. Perhaps more than any other art form (except maybe, popular music and--if you view it as an artform--television), the movies just about beg for a subjective analysis. It's what made reading Pauline Kael so much fun after all. Ultimately, movie criticism is about what you like, what moved you, whether or not you could relate to the action on the screen, whether or not you even WANTED to relate to the action on the screen. The whole schmier.And another advantage to the subjective approach--so often, when I re-watch a movie, I respond to it completely differently from the last time. A film you loved twenty years ago has you scratching your head and saying, \"WHAT was I thinking.\" And a film you detested can take on a positive new light for reasons that you can't even begin to put your finger on. You may even find that you go back and forth with a given film to the extent that you begin to realize that subjective commentary may be the ONLY truly honest commentary.Case in point, Fred Zinneman's 1977 film JULIA. There was a time when I was very ambivalent (and really mostly negative) about this movie. It seemed to be an exercise in earnestness, kind of \"special project\" movie that the relatively recently politicized Jane Fonda undertook so frequently in the 1970s. Actually, though, I found that the political story worked pretty well. The subplot about Lillian's struggles to establish herself as a playwright nearly drove me up the wall, precisely for the reasons that others have detailed here. The scenes of her chainsmoking, tearing her hair--and actually throwing the typewriter out the window (try doing that with your computer these days) virtually SCREAMED \"serious writer at work.\" When I watched this film in my 20s, I wasn't very patient with what I felt were cinematic cliches.When I watched the film again recently, I found that these scenes didn't bother me half as much as they had back then. It may well be it's because I've seen hundreds of films in the interim and have come to realize that there is a kind of \"cinematic shorthand\" (a much friendlier term than \"cinematic cliche, wouldn't you say?) that has always been employed (whether you're talking about images of the hands of clock speeding by--or calendar pages being torn off--or something as basic as a voiceover, a device central to the film JULIA). I seem to have grown a lot more patient with such cinematic conventions over the years. And in the case of JULIA, I have actually started to see the typewriter throwing as further possible evidence of a self-mythologizing tendency on the part of Lillian Hellman, the author of the film's source material, the \"memoir\" PENTIMENTO.Mary McCarthy has been widely quoted as having said that every word that Lillian Hellman ever wrote was \"a lie, including 'the' and 'and.' I don't know enough about Hellman or McCarthy to comment extensively. But the film, perhaps inadvertantly, raises a lot of interesting questions about the very nature of what a memoir is, or a film biography. If Lillian Hellman sought self-aggrandizement, which seems likely, does she also not touch on some very real truths about the nature of courage and heroism. And in the end, doesn't she (or maybe don't the filmmakers) tell a pretty good story?Take it with a grain--or a shaker--of salt. Put some of it on your popcorn. And enjoy a remarkable story about two remarkable women. In this po-mo world, we're becoming used to taking every tale as a fiction. When it's told with good acting, good direction, good cinematography, and, yes, mostly good writing, it's pretty easy to take a few \"lies\" with the truth, the chaff with the wheat, and to still take a few lessons from the process.",

And that adds as much time and strenghtening as you desire to your yoga workout.I have hesitated for years to wait until I found the \"perfect\" group yoga class to attend. But I was never motivated enough to go for an hour long class, with the obligatory 15 minute drive each way. 1.5hrs down the drain.I do this routine anywhere in the house, with the disc on my laptop.

    "review/text": "Like a lot of surfers, I half heartedly strectch and warm up before I paddle out, and I almost never stretch or cool down after a long surf session. Partly due to laziness, partly because I get impatient when it's \"going off\" and I just wanna get wet, and partly because I've always thought I was a naturally limber dude. Well, after trying this dvd out at a friend's house before a session it really made me realize how stiff I actually am and how much more limber and energized I could actually be. This dvd is a great introduction into Yoga, especially if you're a surfer. It's a great way to warm up, get limber and energize your body before a dawn patrol sesh, or anytime really. In this dvd Peggy Hall focuses on basic warm up stretches and poses but for the uninitiated they can prove to be awkard and slightly difficult at first. She breaks it down by giving you a pre-surf warm up, an in the water stretch out (perfect to do while waiting for sets), and a post-surf cool down. Each session is only about 15 or so minutes so it doesn't take much time but it leaves you feeling super loose and full of energy. I immediately purchased Volume II after doing Volume I a few times because I was hungry for more. Volume II is a bit more advanced and concentrates on flowing poses together (vinyasa flow) and increasing strength, balance, and lung capacity. If you want to feel loose, flexible, and energized then Peggy's DVDs are for you!!",

I also picked up Yoga for Surfers II and I'm working my way into that routine.When my dad told me he had back pain, I also got him this dvd, and I know he'll love it.",

I also agree with someone's comments that there are a lot of 5 star review for 3/21 that are obviously shrills/fakes.It does have a nice feel, but there isn't enough teaching to make sure you do the poses correctly to avoid injury. She does well with the general basics, sometimes telling you when to inhale/exhale & she's VERY good about telling you the benefits of the poses for surfing or for stretching/strengthening those muscles, but no reminders on how not to do it, such as a sitting spinal twist the twist comes form the waist, don't force it from the upper chest or neck. I have been doing it for 5 years so I was ok, but she did a great shoulder stretch that felt good, but then I got lost how she did it & had to rewind. Also, during poses she was demonstrating, it would cut to the people surfing or even just a seagull flying over a beach. I know it's for surfers, but they can't go 20 min w/o seeing water? There are also several minute long interviews at each chapter, so you will have to fast fwd through that every time. At first I enjoyed the quick pace of the pre-surf session, thinking it would be great when I have little time, but it started to make me feel rushed because it's only held for 2 moderate speed breaths yet it's not meant to be power yoga.The trailer for the intro to each of their three dvds is on there site: yogaforsurfers comPreviews on totalvid com & youtube com",

    "review/text": "I'm not a surfer, but I do practice yoga regularly. I had heard that Yoga for Surfers 1 was excellent for stretching the upper body, an area where I tend to be quite tight, so I decided to try this DVD. Led by surfer/yoga instructor Peggy Hall, the practice portion of this DVD is broken down into 3 segments: a Pre-Surf Session, intended to prepare your body for surfing/other activity; a Water Session containing stretches to do on your surfboard (can also be performed out of the water without a board); and a Post-Surf session providing stretching and relaxation. I have broken down each of these three sessions into greater detail below.Pre-Surf Session: Flexibility and Focus, 9 minutes.This was a nice warm-up session, although I found that it moved a bit too quickly for my preference. After a few standing side stretches, Peggy leads you through a series of standing poses performed entirely on one side before moving to the other. Peggy does not give names of all postures, but they included wide-legged standing forward bend, lunge, twisting lunge, pyramid, warrior 1, triangle, and side angle. Peggy then transitions to the floor via squat and crow pose (a rather advanced arm balance for this otherwise beginning-level practice); final poses include a seated twist and a triceps stretch.Water Session: Energy and Confidence, 4 minutes.This session, which is interspersed with surfer interviews, consists mainly of upper body stretches which you can perform seated on your surfboard in the water (or in a chair if you are on land). There are a few full-body stretches as well, such as down dog using the board.Post-Surf Session: Stretching and Rejuvenation, 20 minutes.This sessions provided a very nice series of stretches performed entirely on the floor. Starting in child's pose, Peggy moves to hands and knees for a side stretch and a cat/cow series. A squat/toe stretch sequence comes next, and then you remain seated on your heels for eagle arms and a chest expansion. Next comes an enjoyable series of side stretches. As with the standing poses, these are performed all on one side before moving to the other, and they include mermaid (a Pilates move), chest expansion/contraction, a unique seated twist, pigeon pose (adding a quad stretch), half spinal twist, easy seated forward bend, 1-legged seated forward bend, and then spinal rolls before repeating on the other side. This segment finishes with table, reclined twist, reclined cobblers, and relaxation pose (savasana).Overall, I enjoyed the gentle stretching offered by this yoga practice. Although with a few exceptions, most of the poses were quite accessible for someone new to yoga, Peggy doesn't offer much in the way of form pointers, so some prior exposure to yoga principles might be beneficial. Those who are more experienced in yoga and looking for a more intense practice will not find it here. I think this DVD (which also includes bonus material such as interviews with surfers) is probably best-suited for those with the goal of obtaining flexibility and relaxation through a basic, easy-to-follow yoga practice.",

It is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community. A better option is Shiva Rhea's Shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction AND a \"yoga matrix\" which allows you to create your own unique routines. Most DVDs become stale after awhile, but the yoga matrix on Shiva Rhea's dvd (in addition to the 4 ready-made routines), prevent this DVD from ever getting old.",

I bought my DVD through Peggys web page.Yes its a bit more pricey,but once on her e mail list,she sends free tips and updates on a weekly if not bi weekly basis and she is there for you to answer any questions etc. Love this DVD,because I hate classes and having to stop my day just to run over to some place and stretch etc. The DVD I use the warm up in AM,have not used any of the excersises out on my boad except if I,m alone somewhere w/my paddleboard,great for doing yoga on even floating with it in the water.I use the am for a warm up and after surf for the obvious, I do the cool down,lasts about 15-20 minutes.Never felt better (only been using it for 2 months),feel more graceful,coordinated and peaceful.Thank you peggy for a product that is enjoyable to watch,listen to and follow.Best yoga DVD for the money...and will be getting #2,after I master all the posses comfortably.Buy this product if at all interested in yoga,especially if you do surf or do any other water sports.",

I didn't want to get up....ever!Session 1 (pre-surf) is a nice 9-minute vinyasa series. I like to use it after running...it's quick and it gets the job done. However, I have to occasionally look up at my TV screen during certain poses because the instruction in this session is not quite detailed enough to follow by Peggy's voice alone.Session 2 (water) was a big waste of time for me. Tt's a 6 minute session while the surfers are in the water waiting for waves (I don't surf). The stretches are pretty much all upper body. However, I would imagine that surfers could get something out of this session...just not me!...If you have a bit of money to burn, though. This is a great little yoga DVD!",

Yoga isn't just about flexibility - it's about awareness, about being fully alive in each moment.\" -Peggy HallTop professional surfers swear by yoga and now see the infinite sea of possibilities in taking up yoga in addition to their favorite sport: surfing. They rely on the advice of instructors like Peggy Hall who writes articles for \"Surf Life for Women.\"In the Fall 2002 issue, she introduces some of the poses she has incorporated into her new workout video. She is an avid surfer and certified yoga instructor.Peggy created the \"Yoga for Surfers\" video series and teaches yoga clinics and private classes. This is a unique workout because it is especially designed for surfers and their specific needs. Expert yoga instruction is interspersed with surf footage.\"Every surfer should discover Yoga.\" -Rochelle Ballard (\"Blue Crush\" stunt surfer)\"Yoga changed my surfing - and my life.\" -Taylor Knox (a noted big-wave charger admired for his powerful, fluid surfing style)The Setting: Filmed at Ballard and Knox's favorite surf breaks on the North Shore in Carlsbad, California.The Level: Beginner to IntermediateThe Poses: Classic yoga with a few very creative twists I hadn't seen before. Intriguing. I really loved the poses and the pace.The Results: Injury prevention, increased strength, flexibility and focus. Helps you to avoid chronic pain and has specific moves that will sharpen your mental focus.I loved the soundtrack, which is pleasant and calming.Volume I has three sections:Pre-Surf Session: Flexibility and FocusYou can use this routine to warm-up before surfing. It is an energizing routine that flows from one pose to the next and can be done at the beach. At home, a \"sticky\" yoga mat and a towel is recommended. This section of the workout will help you avoid injury, ease neck, shoulder, or back pain and sharpen your mental focus.Water Session: Energy and ConfidenceThese are simple moves you can do while on a surfboard out in the water between sets. They can also be done at home while seated as most of the poses are for the upper body. It is fun to do the poses in your living room with the aid of the \"top of a step\" betweentwo chairs (so adventurous). There is a segment where you should really be sitting or on a surf board and it was not difficult to incorporate most of the poses into an at-home workout. If you live at the beach and can see your TV from the sand, thenyou have it made.Post-Surf Session: Stretching and Rejuvenation.This is my favorite section. It is just so relaxing and you could do this section after a longday because it helps to calm your mind and rejuvenate your body.Yoga will also enhance other areas of your life and make you feel more in control of your inner world. This video has been very well received in surfing and yoga circles.Highly Recommended because this workout not only gives you a great workout, it will help you to find a deep sense of well-being and increase your energy level.A workout lifestyle to give you the flexibility to surf better, longer.Also look for Volume II: Fluid Power Yoga for Surfers which is a 40-minute routine to strengthen and stretch all your surfing muscles while improving stamina, balance and mental focus.~The Rebecca ReviewAuthor of Seasoned with Love: A collection ofbest-loved recipes inspired by over 40 cultures",

I think Peggy is probably a good instuctor, but this DVD isn't a good example. The best part of this DVD is the advert for Rochelle's surf camp, which includes a cameo appearance of Minnie Driver. I found this portion of the DVD to be inspiring. If you are looking for some instruction on yoga poses, this is not a good choice.",

I have been recommending this to friends, neighbors, strangers, and anyone else who will listen. This is the best thing that has happened to my back.I have injured my back over the years of surfing, skateboarding, other sports and aggravated by bad posture and computers. I have been to massage therapy, physical therapy, chiroprators, accupunturists, medical doctors - I was headed for surgery. My wife finally dragged me to yoga classes and after 6 - 90 minute sessions in 2 weeks, my back started to noticeably improve. I have a pinched nerve in my upper back that causes discomfort/pain near my right shoulder blade.Then I heard about this not too long afterwards and bought the DVD. This was when it first came out. The 10 minute warm up and the 20 minute post sessions were exactly what I needed. It was quick, it focused on the back and shoulder - surfer problem areas. They are easy to do and do not take up much time. I would (and do all the time) highly recommend this to anyone having any back problems. Try this before you try surgery, drugs, accupuncture, etc. Now as long as I do these 30 minute sessions 2-3 times a week, I am pain free! Thank you Peggy Hall!",

A great way to stay relaxed and focused in and out of the water. After about 3 weeks I began to notice increased flexablity and upper body strength and I've noticed measured improvement that I can 'surf better, longer'. So why just 3 stars? The downside for me is the narrative/interview part kind of chops it up a bit making the pre surf warm up seem a little like an infomercial and taking away from what could/should be instruction for beginners technique-wise. Even when the camera is focused on the instructor it's often only waist up. I enthusiastically recommend this dvd but ONLy if you already have several dozen yoga classes under your belt.",

    "review/text": "Ok, I must admit, before I tried this DVD, I was REALLY skeptical if things like Yoga would ever help improving surf. I also thought that this may be another hype. I could not believe why so many ppl rave about the DVD either. I understand that many experienced would absolutely disagree with overall production but this DVD helped me practicing Yoga at least, but most of all, it really is helping my surf, too. I'm still a beginner/baby-surfer myself and for the last few months before I purchased this DVD, I felt like my surf was not improving at all, rather, that was completely opposite. I am not a kind of person who practice Yoga to begin with, I always thought Yoga was way too mellow for my lifestyle and therefore, not my kind of thing. I came across with this DVD, read few reviews and thought I should give it a try. Even if it didn't work for improving my surf, at least I could start something that may(or may not) work for relaxing & calming myself down. I really needed it anyways. First few tries were horrible...I could not maintain those postures or hold the certain pose at all but I guess that means I was either not fit enough or certain muscle groups did need more strength. Been using this DVD for almost 4 months now and I really wanna point out that I started seeing improvements. I certainly can catch more waves now than before, not much muscle soreness after session, also, I learned how to relax & calm down which I can certainly benefit in any occasion whether in or out from water. Overall great DVD. I am ordering the vol 2 now!",

Classic rockers such as &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Man&quot; are interspersed with terrific versions of &quot;Martial Law&quot; and &quot;Waves of Fear.&quot; This is Lou Reed at a vibrant and creative time in his career, able to present older material such as &quot;Kill Your Sons&quot; and &quot;Satellite of Love&quot; with the same energy and originality with which he invests his newer songs. One bonus - you can catch Andy Warhol in the audience and if you read his diaries you will find a refernce to this performance. Lou appears a little apprehensive at times during the show, less confident than at other times during his career, but that does not impair his performance one bit. Wait for the backstage comments at the end of the show when he describes hitting a &quot;perfect note&quot; which lifts him up away from the stage and into the audience. This is a tight, controlled rock 'n' roll show which all Lou Reed fans will enjoy, both new and old.",

    "review/text": "I'm glad they've put this out on DVD; I bought it back in '84 on videocassette. It was a classic then and now. Lou Reed has never sounded better in his solo career, and he's backed by a dream band (half of Richard Hell & the Voidoids with Fernando Saunders on bass). As Lou says after the concert, the set is \"short and delicious\"--a mix of VU and solo faves with tracks from his excellent early '80s albums \"The Blue Mask\" and \"Legendary Hearts.\"Back in '83, Lou had been off the road for at least a couple of years, and he seems, for once, to be enjoying himself onstage. Also, he's in great voice (given his limited range), still able to actually sing VU tracks like \"Rock and Roll\" and \"New Age,\" not just talk or shout them. Those tracks in particular appear here in arguably their best-ever versions, the VU never having quite nailed them on \"Loaded\" or on the various live versions floating around.Almost all the songs from his solo career are considerably improved over their studio versions, especially \"Kill Your Sons,\" a powerful song that got lost on a bad album (\"Sally Can't Dance\"). Lou's insane feedback solo on this one says more about the electoshock therapy that is the song's subject than the lyrics do. Also, special kudos to \"Turn Out the Light,\" which is kind of flat on \"Legendary Hearts,\" but is playful and edgy live, capped by a funky (!), almost countryish guitar solo by Lou. It's funny to watch him pull faces during the solo, almost as if he can't believe he's playing it.And the band is just superb: Robert Quine is one of the great rock guitarists, capable of slash-and-burn solos (\"Waves of Fear\") or beautifully lyrical ones (\"Satellite of Love\"). Fernando Saunders plays melodic, distinctive bass--check out the solo on \"New Age,\" and Fred Maher is a solid, powerful drummer. Lou's had some good bands since, but this remains his greatest--other than the original VU, of course. And on this night, they were in top form.This is simply an essential Lou Reed purchase. Admittedly, it's nothing special visually--Lou and the band playing in a small club with rather harsh lighting, that's it--but it's all about the music. And what music! A true classic.",

Alongside Reed's ever charimastic performance, mr. Robert 'Voidoid' Quine is in IMHO really the main force at this concert, delivering his trademark blistering guitar solos all over the place, backed by the solid rhythm section of Saunders and Maher. The song selection is very good, ranging from VU to \"Blue Mask\", the sound quality is nice and the shooting have an adequate sparse elegance.Well, folks, this is SHEER PERFECTION for Lou Reed's fans!!!",

In June of 2000 I was treated to a live performance by Lou and Co. in Portland, Or. while he was on tour to promote the release of Ecstasy! That night was a stand on your feet, foot stomping night to remember and I came away a true Lou fan! I mention this because I have that same feeling every time I watch \"A Night with Lou Reed.\" Lou's great, the music's great and the film is flawless. It's easy to see that Lou is having fun and the electricity is freely flowing between artist and audience! Once again I am captivated by the man's ability to capture and hold on to an audience from the beginning to the end of a truely great show!! I highly recommend \"A Night with Lou Reed\" to anyone who wants to experience the feel of sitting in the front row at a performance by one of America's true Rock and Roll Animals!",

Lou's playing for his peers in NYC, like Andy Warhol, and pulling out all the stops. The band, with Fernando Saunders on bass, and Robert Quine on Guitar, absolutely melts together, they're so tight. Lou was on an upswing here, having just released one of his best solo albums ever, THE BLUE MASK, and showing off what turned out to be his live sound for the next 15 years. In interviews, Lou called this &quot;Adult Rock and Roll&quot;, but really, it could also be called punk jazz. Or maybe, it defies classification. However, if you love Lou Reed, and want to see him at work reproducing his best solo work of the 80s, then here you go. After seeing the show, you realize it's a loss to the history of rock, that more films of his live work from the 60s onward don't exist. So what is around, is all the more valuable.",

The usually reclusive Reed allows everybody to have a front row seat to this magical performance as well as a slight glimpse backstage. From the very beginning of the evening, Reed and his backup band are so on it that they will leave you mezmorized. It has been nearly twenty years since this performance. And it really stands the test of time. Reed, the godfather of new wave for many, is that rare artist that is, and always will be, looked up at for generations. To correct the previous reviewer, while backstage after the performance, Reed exclaims that this is the kind of performance that you hope that somebody in the audience has at least a tape recorder. This DVD is a must-own for any Velvet Underground fan or anybody interested in seeing a master at his best.",

He is drugged up to the eye-balls and displays some frankly frightening facial contortions and twitches whilst struggling to make it to the end of this gig. His eyeballs roll o the back of his head and he performs guitar solos hunched in a little ball with his back to the audience.His band is composed of an effeminately ineffectual drummer and a lead guitarist who should be sent back to the greasy diner where Lou found him. Needless to say they can do nothing to mask his inebriated state (even the Hunter/Wagner band would have had difficulty).The production is pretty shoddy, bad camera work, so overexposed that Lou looks as if he's had an accident with some fake tan lotion. And just to top it off they cut out all the bits where he talks between songs -often the most entertaining parts of his concerts.How this performance ever made it to VHS let alone DVD is a wonder, especially considering that neither the mind-blowing 'Velvets Redux' reunion tour nor Reed's intense collaboration with John Cale; 'Songs for Drella' are available in this format.And if you don't believe me you can hear it from Mr Reed himself at the end of the concert when he is filmed telling the guys running the show that the venue had bad acoustics and that this isn't the sort of gig that anyone should keep a tape of.",

This is a stunning set incorporating the talents of top NY musicians who earn a crust in the pit for top broadway shows.The program is epic, so much excitement and passion displayed. The presentation reminds one of the bands of Herman and Rich (the latter when he is enjoying being there). Sorry Rich fans!Tommy Igoe is not one drumming 'one-trick' pony. He displays excitement,musicality and sensitivity that not every drummer shows. He has fun, he enjoys everyone's contribution to the music.When he does solo his technical ability/musical sensitivity and need to have a good time, come together. People who see this band every week are so lucky.Get the CD as well for the car, the tracks are slightly different.FAULOUS!!!!",

You usually can't get to that level of recognition without also being a pretty good player. It's not necessary to be a great player to be a great teacher, but it helps with the \"street cred\". This DVD shows that Mr. Igoe has more than enough street-c. His talents are right up there with the absolute best of the best of the drum-kings including Weckl, Gadd, Smith, and Colaiuta. Don't believe me? Just get this DVD and watch. This guy has so much musical talent....he plays so musically, with so much power and speed -- but always within the context of the composition. In addition, he leads an absolutely incredible band. Not only is this DVD a must have for any drummer, anyone who would enjoy a phenomenal big-band performance should have it too. Every other member of the band is up to the incredible standard set by Mr. Igoe. The only bad news is that after seeing this DVD, you'll probably have to add a trip to NY and the birdland jazz club as another \"must\" to see the band play in person. Until you can arrange that, get this DVD and enjoy it over, and over again. I'd give it 6 stars if I could. Can't wait for the next CD or DVD from the band!",

Completely swept away!So,when I got this collection of British talking heads beaming at how smart they all were to have theorised all these creatures out of nothing but thin air-headedness,I was disenchanted at best. They all came off as arrogant and way too self satisfied.While listening you could hear the flaws in many of the basic assumtions.The ecologies and behaiviors shown were often far too over simplified to create their \"new possibilities\". As a viewer your suspention of disbelief was completely shot! There was no way to invest your imagination in these soap bubble epocs being constantly reminded that they are just creations.Obviously,I am in the minority here and I'm shouting \"FIRE\" long after the smoke has cooled.So be it.

But I only saw the last half of it or so, even less probaly. This was interesting, seeing what it might be like in a certain amount of million years from now. But this was nothing special either. The CGI was terrible, movies such as Jurassic Park had better, and that was over 10 years bbefore this was made! The names they gave the creatures were highly laughable at, and even thinking of the few names I remember(which are Flish, Giant land squid, and the other land squid) send me into a short giggle fit.Basiclly, this is nothing extreme. Maybe a buy, but I suggest waiting for it to come on 'Woah Sunday!' again so you can compare it to Mo's side show. Or rent it.",

    "review/text": "I think I saw this once, without the scientific commentary, and it was fantastic. I don't believe, as one reviewer said here, that you have to be more than an \"average joe\" to understand the commentaries by illustrious teachers, because what they're saying isn't that complex, and it's explained by well-drawn digital diagrams, etc. In fact, the digital stuff is exquisite. It's just too bad there's not more of it, and I think in the original I saw I loved it because it just went from one digital image to another, and the artistry was marvelous. Frankly, I was shocked at how boring the scientific commentary was. At the risk of sounding anti-intellectual (which I am not - I'm a writer and teacher myself) I have to wonder why these incredibly frumpy, lumpy, dumpy scientists were allowed to appear as themselves on what was otherwise a slick and attractive presentation (although there was nowhere near as much variety as there could have been - the repetitiveness of the imagery in this version nearly drove me mad). What I'm saying is that if you are going to create a commercial film for mass consumption, at least make sure that your stars trim their hair, wear well-fitting clothing that at least camouflages a paunch, and get rid of of the absurd accessories, i.e., floppy, printed day-glow bow-ties and matching pocket handkerchiefs. The public is used to well-groomed celebrities and presenters, but that's not what I am talking about. It's nice to see \"real\" people in commercial productions. However - even \"real\" people can present a semblance of taste, when appearing before the public. The only thing that redeems these geeks is the fact that they resemble, somewhat, the creatures they are describing, especially the giant squid at the end with eight klutzy legs and the pulsing blue light on its forehead: a very attractive millipod or whatever the freak it was. Enough. I just threw the freaking thing against the wall in frustration. I suppose I'll have to write again and make amends for my rude commentary. But really - is this thing actually a comedy? By the end of it my husband I were writhing on the floor in hysterical laughter. Jim Carey should do a take-off. Love you, guys; geniuses. You made me laff.",

The animation in this show leaves a lot to be desired. The creatures don't even blend in with their environment, and they all look smooth as clay. No texures evident at all! And the theories? Oh boy, how do I explain this, other than saying it was complete RUBBISH!!! Let me just state a few theories that had me rolling with laughter! First, there is the thought that tortises would evolve into creatures that grew to be larger than the largest dinosaur! Second, you have flying fish that look like and sound like fish, and can actually......well.....FLY!!! Finally, this thought almost made me die of laughter; squids will emerge from the water and INHERIT the Earth!!!!!!!!!?!!!!!?????!!!!!??! This is not science people! True science is something you can study first-hand, and examine in a lab for goodness sake!!! Evolution itself is still a theory in question, and suddenly, scientists believe that they can predict evolution's every move? Even in the distant future!?! Then again, I don't see why they can't, because this \"theory\" was made up by man in the first place!!! Finally, the names of these \"future\" creatures were so stupid with a capital \"S\", that I nearly urinated in my jeans when I heard names like, Flish, Snowstalker, Sharkopath, and Toraton! But look at the bright side, this could be a new idea for, yet another, expansion pack to the Pokemon series. Overall.......Oh whatever you know my opinion: If you are gullible and closed minded toward this pseudo-science, then be my guest. Put your brain in a blender, bring a bucket of popcorn with you, and have a blast! On the other hand, if you are more open minded toward genuine facts, then please....do yourself a favor, and watch more realistic, less evolution based programs, such as the \"Walking With...\"series, and it's spin-offs.",

    "review/summary": "Not as Silly as I Had Supposed!",
    "review/text": "I did not have high hopes for this series. I assumed it would be rather silly and was looking to be entertained by the strange and the bizarre. I did find those aspects but I found more as well.These programs look at the possible evolution of life in the future without humans and in radically different environments. These speculative life forms are interesting but I expected nothing beyond wild, \"artists' conceptions\". The results are wild but they are based on informed speculation. However bizarre the hypothetical creature presented is, it is compared to current fauna with similar or analogous features. Those features are just taken further and the results are interesting to watch.This program could be looked upon as a way to teach the fundamental ideas of natural selection in a new and different manner; looking to the future instead of the past.Episode synopses appear below:Disc One: 5 Million Years - Ice Age WorldWelcome to the Future - This first episode sets out the suppositions. It postulates a world without humans in which natural selection has had free reign to produce bizarre new life forms. Three time periods are posited. The first is about 5 million years from now. The earth is in the grip of a terrible ice age and the life forms are adapted accordingly. The next scenario takes the opposite extreme. It takes place 100 million years in the future and is a hothouse world. To change things even more dramatically, the third epoch conceived is 200 million years in the future and takes place after a mass extinction event in which most species are killed and the few survivors adapt and radiate into the strangest life forms of all. Each period provides brief glances at some to the imaginary life forms of the future but none is examined in any real depth. This episode serves to set the stage for what is to come by giving the background.Return of the Ice - This episode concentrate on an arctic environment about 5 million years in the future. Some of the life forms presented include a large rodent which travels in herds, a bird evolved to take the place of toothed whales and a large carnivore that preys on both of them.The Vanished Sea - Taking place in the same ice age of the previous episode, this episode examines a completely different environment. The locus is the Mediterranean Sea with a big difference from the present day. It is all dried up and is now a salt desert supporting only specifically adapted animals. The ones examined closely in this episode are a large frilled lizard living on the salt flats, a descendant of the martin which is now a major predator and a highly evolved pig.The Prairies of Amazonia - In this episode we visit yet another biome of the ice age of the future. This one is the vast grassland that occupies most of the continent of South America. It has replaced the Amazon and there are some new and different creatures but, by and large, these creatures face the same challenges that confront today's inhabitants of savannahs. We are introduced to a tool making monkey that bears some resemblance to a baboon, a large flightless bird which has become a top predator and a large rodent which has evolved defensive armor.Cold Kansas Desert - The climate this time is the great desert of the North American Midwest. This desert, though, is frigid owing to the great ice fields. Here, we encounter a large rodent related to the ones of the grasslands of the previous episode. They feed on the same tubers as a small, burrowing descendant of the quail; one with a hive oriented social structure. These flightless birds are the principal prey of gigantic, carnivorous bats which roam the skies looking for easy pickings; they are the evolutionary successors to the buzzards.Disc Two: 100 Million Years - Hothouse WorldWaterland - An additional 95 million years has passed since the time of the previous disk and the world has changed a lot. It is a very hot and very moist world and life has had to adapt. This first episode takes place in a swamp environment. Huge descendants of turtles, the largest land animal ever to walk the earth, stalk the swamps looking for vegetation to eat. Trying to keep out of the way are terrestrial (amphibious) octopi. These mollusks have colonized the land seeking safety from large, predatory fish which use electricity on a scale not envisioned by our modern eels.Flooded World - I like coelenterates as much as the next guy but this episode didn't do much for me. It focuses on the shallow seas of the hothouse earth. The major critters are a huge jellyfish that actually consists of a variety of creatures working together for the common good, a sea slug that has become as mobile as your average fish and a sea spider that exists to protect the big jellyfish.Tropical Antarctica - Antarctica has migrated from its position over the southern pole and has become a lush, tropical jungle. Many of the depicted life forms are evolved from petrels. Some take the role of a hummingbird and another has evolved a noxious chemical weapon system. Very large insects are a major predator but smaller insects get their licks in as well. This was a pretty good episode.The Great Plateau - This episode takes place on a mountain plateau that makes the Himalayas look like minor foothills. Its inhabitants include giant, blue birds with four wings, large spiders that build webs across canyons and which farm mammals and these curious mammals which are the last ones left on earth. It's another really good episode.Disc Three: 200 Million Years - New WorldThe Endless Desert - It's a new world. Vulcanism and an asteroid strike have changed the planet immensely. The continents coming together to form a super-continent has also had an effect. Most of the earth is a vast desert. The wiping out of most species has provided new opportunities for a few. A termite has evolved to be adapted to hunting, agriculture and mining. Worms have it good as well and demonstrate both agrarian and hunting varieties.The Global Ocean - One continent means that there is once ocean as well and this ocean has seen some major changes. Fish are virtually gone. Their multitudinous places in the ecosystems have been taken over by arthropods. Fish are not completely gone, however. Some have become real flying creatures that can breath air. Cephalopods are around as well and they have evolved. Their intelligence is greater and their camouflage is more effective. They can also get huge. Some things remain the same, however. Sharks are still efficient killers; they have just further refined their methods.Graveyard Desert - More troubles in the desert are the theme of this one as we learn about scavenging beetles, scavenging worms, hopping snails and some carnivorous plants that feed on larger life forms than small bugs. This has been the only episode thus far where a plant is a significant part of the show.The Tentacled Forest - Although most of the land is a great desert, there is a magnificent rainforest along the coast. In this environment there are more fish turned to land dwelling flying creatures, giant lichens which resemble trees, slime molds that hunt and a gigantic, walking terrestrial squid. To top things off, there is another squid which dwells in the trees and swings around like an ape. These are intelligent squids and the possibility is left open that they will further involve and become...civilized.",

Most of it is very interesting and while the DVDs have no extras, the episodes do, in the form of scientists explaining in detail what examples of animals in the past or in the present allowed them to design such wonderful new future creatures. They also talk about social behavior, changes to the climate and to the Earth's land mass itself.Sometimes the CG looks a tad fake, but kiddies should enjoy it.

When humans has gone (how or why is not explained) and the world has returned back to the primitive world is once was. This DVD version of the movie is quite different then on Animal Planet. Some new details are added it is also missing completly the space prob. My guess is the space prob was just Animal Planets form of political correctness. The Future is Wild is extremely imaginative. The bizzare future animals it predicts are very cool. Scientist explaining laws of evolution and using examples of modern animals make this future world more probable. It takes three time periods. 5 million years, 100 million years, and 200 million years in the future. As expected the more time goes on the more bizzare the animals get. 5 million years we see giant swimming birds, giant running birds, giant bats, giant rats, running lizards, desert pigs, and rattlebacked rodents. This is a world of ice were creatures are scrambling to survive in the cold. 100 million years the world has warmed up. We see turtules bigger then the largest dinosaur, amphibious octupus, giant killer bugs, four winged birds, and poisionus birds. 200 million years in the future a mass extinction wiped out all mammels, birds, and reptiles. However we have swimming lobsters, super sharks, flying fish, hopping snails, plant worms, and squid that swing from tree to tree. All of this may seem to weird to be true but the world of 200 million years ago was just as different. These future animals are shown using computer animation in live action environments. While it is clearly inferior to framestones television projects the animation is good enough to serve its purpose. This 5 hour series spans over three discs. All are presented in anamorphic widescreen. DVD lacks any special features on the animation and has only 2 channels of sound. Theres more then enough disc room for a 5.1 track and at least some extras. This is a bit dissipointing but I still recommend The Future is Wild. It is a glimse at our possible future world.

    "review/text": "The Future Is Wild takes a peek into the future as we know it. There are three discs. The first one is set five million years into the future. It is the middle of another Ice Age. There is an introduction and four episodes. Every other disc has four episodes.Episode 1: Return of the IceShagrats stuggle to survive as they are stalked by hungry Snowstalkers. The Shagrat looks like a cross between a capybara and a lemming. The snowstalker is a white cat with sabre-tooth like fangs.Episode 2: The Vanished SeaThe bottom of Europe and the tip of Africa has come together, blocking off the Mediterrainean from the Atlantic Ocean. This has caused all the water to evaporate, only leaving a salt flat.On this salt flat lives a family of cryptiles, lizard-like animals that run on two legs. Islands, have become small patches of land covered with crevases. On the crevases, lives the scrofa, a pig-like animal that is in constant danger.Episode 3: Praries of the AmizoniaThe amazon rainforest has died out and become a vast plain. On these plains, Karakillers hunt in groups to track down the Babookaris. Also, the rattleback has evolved from various marsupiels and has formed a fire-proof exterior.Episode 4: Cold Kansas DesertThe rattleback is also making a stand in the Kansa desert. A bird species called the spinks, has adapted to underground life through the raging sandstorms. Also, the deathgleaners hunt for them on the surface like bats.The second disc travels 100 million years into the future to find out more about the corse of evolution.Episode 5: WaterlandThe octopus family is taking its irst crawls onto land. The new name is the swampus. Their nest are located in plants, wich are in consistant danger of being toppled over by Torutons. Torutons are 120 ton creatures that feed on 1,323 pounds of food a day. Surprizingly, there closest relatives today is the tiny tortoise.In the water, the lurkfish is always wating to shock its prey with 1,000 volts of electricity.Episode 6: Flooded WorldThis episode is set in the shallow seas of the future. Many, many jellyfish have formed together to form the ocean phantom. In the ocean phantom's tenticles, the spindle trooper is always ready to get the food. By food, I mean the reef glider.Episode 7: Tropical AntarcticaAntarctica has come north to the equator. As a result, it is covered with lush rainforests. These rainforests are home to spitfire beetles and spitfire birds. The flutterbird is also a welcome guest to this new Antarctica.Episode 8: The Great PlateauA great blue windrunner dominates the high altitudes of the new plateau. The plateau was formed when Australia when north and struck North America and Asia. The great blue windrunner is a four winged bird that relys on the silver spider for food. The silver spider relys on the last mammal ever, the poggle, to give them food. They feed the poggle until it is fat enough, and then they kill it and feed the poor creature to the queen.On the final disc, The timestream eccelerates to 200 million years into an alien world.Episode 9: The Endless Desert100 million years earlier, a massive asteroid impact wiped out 95 percent of the Earth's life-forms. After the world recovered, Pangea II became the new land mass. The endless desert was home to a veriety of creatures like the terabyte, and antlike insect thet shot sticky goo at its prey. Its prey, meaning the centapede-like garden worm, was helpless. In the water, the gloomworm and the slickribbon live in a bloody world.Eisode 10: The Global OceanWith one landmass, there was one ocean. The ocean flish flew over this ocean and fed on the common silver swimmer. But the food chain dosn't stop there. The rainbow squid feasts on the flish and the Sharkopah considers the rainbow squid a delicacy.Episode 11: Graveland DesertThis world is home to a one legged snail called the desert hopper. These creatures share their desert home with a menagerie of other aliens including the deathbottle, the grimworm, and the bumblebeetle.Episode 12: Tentacled DesertIn this final episode, squids have evolved to immense sizes, and have moved onto the land perminantly. The megasquid is a perfect example. This beast is larger then an elephant! Though it is huge, its flaw is that it is not very smart. Its treetop dwelling relative, the squibbon, is very social and very smart. This species could even trigger another civilization...This is the exact reason that the future is wild!",

    "review/text": "As a tremendous fan of Dougal Dixon's \"After Man\", I was shocked to find out recently that \"The Future Is Wild\" had slipped under my radar. I now have both the TV series and the book derived from it. Surprisingly enough, I would recommend buying the book and skipping this DVD set.Why? It would be easy to get down on the CG animation, which is mostly neither more nor less than mediocre. However, it really isn't too broken, and there are a few genuinely impressive shots scattered about. The main problem with this series comes from outside the CG department: When the program shows you the *same* 10 seconds of animation ten or more times (I am not making this up) in ten or twenty minutes, it becomes very difficult to keep a straight face. Sometimes the footage is tinted or *reversed right-to-left* in a feeble attempt at disguise, but most of the time it is simply one of three or four shots per species, played over and over and over again under different circumstances. The narration is also almost entirely narrative in nature - seldom explanatory - and riddled with awkward pauses, forced drama, and endless repetition.Even given the limited amount of animation available, the show didn't have to be this way; much more sparing use could have been made of the animation by expanding the scientists' filmed explanations, as well as the excellent real-world footage which is used to explain the climatic changes and modern-day basis for their speculations. As it is, the series winds up as a shapeless, shallow circus leaning far too heavily on a sideshow.",

I could go on and on with the concepts that are applicable to this series. I have been using this series for 3 years now and I have yet to have a student complain about the series being boring or too \"fake\". I have had MANY students ask if this is real, to which I have to remind students that it is set in the future and therefore the animals can't be real but the concepts are real.Why is this applicable to teachers? The DVDs introduce fictional creaures, many of which are absolutely fantastic, and then procede to explain how the amazing things they have come up with are already around on Earth right now, just in different forms. So the series really is about present animals as much as future animals.I use it in high school, but it is just as useful for middle school. Please, if you are a science teacher, you owe it to yourself to see these DVDs.

Now, be real. If humans haven't completely ravaged or destroyed the planet in 5 million years, we will be plenty advanced enough to survive a second ice age.

    "review/summary": "A Rather Cool Concept For A Program",
    "review/text": "\"The Future Is Wild\" is a rather cool concept for a program. There's tons of dinosaur themed documentaries out there that look at ancient fauna and their evolution, but this is really the only show I've seen that speculates about the future. Obviously, it's not a real \"documentary\" in the literal sense because it's 100% speculative fiction, but it is scientifically informed speculation, so it's quite interesting and fun.The whole premise of \"The Future Is Wild\" is that humans are gone from earth and the audience now gets to see what might happen in the evolution of the remaining animals there. The DVD series is quite long (about 5 hours total) and spans as far as 200 million years into the future. The imaginative views of what new animals would evolve over time are quite interesting, but obviously there's no way to know how true they would be because something as huge as evolution that far into the future would be very difficult to predict. Still, the scientists who worked with the film makers do stop to give exposition about their reasoning behind a particular animal and what it evolved from and why, and I appreciated these segments. Overall, I felt that the explanations and reasoning given for certain animal designs were pretty sound, but that the names given to the animals were pretty silly (\"Phlish\" and \"Slither Suckers\"). To be fair though, that's the sort of names that people would give to new animals - just very descriptive ones. Some of them still sound pretty silly though. As for any other complaints I have... I'm annoyed that the DVDs don't have a \"play all\" option. You have to select and play each episode (4 per disc) individually. That was a bit more inconvenient, but not a deal breaker or anything. Lastly, I'm a bit disappointed that there are no special features of any kind. None.So, do I recommend this DVD set? Well, if the premise I described earlier sounds interesting to you and you can withstand some silliness, then give it a try. If it doesn't, then obviously give it a pass. Also, if you liked this show and are looking for something similar to check out, try watching \"Alien Planet\".",

    "review/text": "I watched this program and wrote a review of its scientific principles for a college assignment. Honestly, I'm surprised by how many reviews suggest that the creatures presented are too \"fantastic\" to have evolved from living forms in 200 million years. If you've ever studied what earth looked like 200 million years -ago-, it really is not all that fantastic...in fact, I was surprised things didn't change -more-.The scientific principles behind this are very sound. The scientists creating this series looked at existing diversity of life forms and adaptations that exist today, and projected future continental drift and climate change to see what the world of 5, 100, or 200 million years from now would look like. The phyla that inherit the future Earth are molluscs and arthropods, currently the most taxonomically dominant and diverse groups on the planet today. They have very successful body forms, and it did not surprise me to see them largely take over the land from tetrapod forms in 200 million years. Especially in the harsh conditions of a worldwide supercontinental desert after a mass extinction, it's no surprise that tetrapods don't last. We and our four-legged kin aren't as well-suited to that sort of environment as other organisms are.In addition, specific episodes focus on different evolutionary and ecological mechanisms. \"Tropical Antarctica\" discusses evolutionary radiation and coevolution in an isolated environment. \"Flooded World\" looks at symbiosis and mutualism. \"Waterland\" examines parental care mechanisms, and each episode of the \"Ice World\" series at 5 million years from now looks at evolution of animals to adapt to a rapidly changing ice age climate.The only thing I can really criticize is the CGI. The effort in this series was obviously put into scientific accuracy rather than stunning visuals. I've seen better CGI out of movies ten years older than this. Something I found annoying, but actually slightly humorous was that they would use the same CGI multiple times to describe a single organism, but mirrored or with a different color filter, and apparently expected no one to notice.Of course, the point of this series was not the CGI, it was the science, so it only loses one star for that. That and the names of organisms are a bit fanciful, like deathgleaners and sharkopaths, but again, that's not the point of the series. In addition, not all questions about specific organisms are explained, but I imagine that to be the nature of a 25-minute program rather than a flaw in the science.Although we won't be able to start judging it as accurate or inaccurate for 5 million years (and I highly doubt humans will be around that long, honestly, at least not in our current form), it does present realistic and well-thought-out possibilities. I think this program would be an excellent discussion-starter for a class on evolution, ecology, or organismal diversity. I doubt that in 200 million years, we'll see the skies populated by \"flish\" as seen in the film. At the very least they'll look a lot more realistic! But it is certainly a possibility, and well-justified by scientific knowledge. And that's the whole idea.",

TOO FUNNY!Still, what they are there for and telling us is how they came up with the wild future animals based on what has evolved in the past and it all has a logic to it.But don't get your panties in a twist. It's all just speculation informed a bit by what we know. Don't get too serious This is supposed to be FUN.And it is.It's a great ride. Punctuated by the funniest scientists ever to evolve. So tie that bow tie, get a pocket protector, pop some corn, sit back and just go with the flow. It's great fun. Enjoy!I give it 4 stars because I'm not too fond of the narrator's voice.

Watching this program is much easier if you've read a lot of comic books or science fiction.I believe there were some minor flaws in the walking with dinosaurs series,but the most I can say about this series is how far-fetched a couple of the animals are.It's never explained to my satifaction how a \"flish\" breaths air or water or how it reproduces.The idea of squids becoming monkeys and predatory elephants is ridiculous.Why would a shark bother developing a flashy system of communication when most sharks are solitary...and have looked much the same for millions of years?Still,some animals aren't that far-fetched.There are spiders today that live in colonies with a \"queen\".There are ants that squirt acid. There are birds that burrow in the dirt.Some rodents do get big;the capibarra for instance.There were pre-historic predatory birds that stood about six feet tall.There's even talk of a veleciorapter-relative fossil that had 4 wings.So most of the animals aren't all that much of a stretch to the imagination.CREATIONISTS:The theory of evolution is never called into question.In fact, with the exception of the squids, all of the animals in TFIW can be cataloged today,either in the fossil record or modern day counterparts. Just makes me wonder what they were smoking when they thought up the squid-monkeys.Some of it has to taken with a grain of salt.As far as man's absense,well...it would be the height of egotism to assume that we will be the last animal alive on earth.When watched with an open mind,...and perhaps a sense of humor,this a very enjoyable program.",

    "review/text": "It's funny, our time on this planet is so short (70-80 years) that it can be hard to predict even what the next century would be like. The last century was full of many fanciful predictions (where's my flying car???). In fact, after watching this series, I realized how even ~15,000 years for human civilization seems like a drop in the bucket compared to how millions, billions of years old this planet is.Each disc features a different point in the future - 5 million years, 100 million years, 200 million years. Those millions of years is a long time for creatures to change and evolve. The new animals (which seem a little like they came out of \"Impossible Creatures\" are all based on a present-day animal. The creatures are all given some rather silly names as well, such as a poggle (the last mammal), the swampas (land squid) and squibbons (tree-dwelling squid). Basically I remember them as dinural bats, underground quail, large spiders, rattle rodents, giant tortoises, and killer prairie birds.The CGI used for the animals isn't so great compared to other examples and by showing animals in danger or being killed, the program tried to be like a traditional nature show. But the CGI was decent enough to give people an idea. The predictive evolution was complimented by nature footage that demonstrate animal behaviour and how the future animals might use or develop these traits in the future. I thought the predictions were very creative though and it was enjoyable to watch.No predictions are given for the future race, and it is assumed that nature has \"taken it back\". I think it would have been too hard or controversial for the producers to feature humans.",

    "review/text": "\"The Future is Wild\" is an interesting take on the future of life on Earth at 5, 100, and 200 MY in the future. The CGI is pretty believable, and they back up their more unusual claims with modern-day examples. The names are a bit silly, but you can't really expect a proper Genus-species name for an imagined life-form!Probably my greatest gripe about this is the 200 MY in the future segment. The creators of this had a bit of a penchant for invetebrates, I think; the entire tetrapod line has gone extinct by this point (which I find difficult to believe given the length it's been around already and the huge degree of diversity found in it), which definitely provides the opportunity for huge adaptive radiation in the other genera -- but as I said, the premise is a bit difficult to swallow (a bit of tetrapod-centrism on my part? Maybe.). Its also implied we (ie, tetrapods) got some stiff competition from invertebrates when oxygen levels rose. However, given our generally more efficient oxygen processing it would seem that insectivorous birds and such would make the proverbial killing in this environment, but oh well.If we accept that as a given, however, I definitely believe that cephalopods would be the next-in-line, so to speak. And in any case, the series is entertaining to watch, and gives a good taste of evolution in action.",

Somewhere around the release of &quot;Volunteers&quot; would be a good place to start. Have them work backwards from there, to the beginning. Then, have a talented director make a documentary out of it, with a small emphasis on interviews and history, and a big, big, big emphasis on the MUSIC.

The music on this DVD is OK, in the three to four star range, but is has a juvenile begining and breaks between the songs.It comes from a 1983 concert when Grace Slick and Micky Thomas were the lead singers. This was the Jefferson Airplane/Starship &quot;Corporate Rock&quot; period when they were at their most popular. It wasn't one of the best periods in Rock and Roll. This bland arena rock was competing with Disco, creating an artistic void that was filled by Punk. Grace Slick is dressed up as a cross between Joan Jett and Pat Benatar. Paul Kantner looks pretty ridiculous, too.Compared to the Jefferson Airplane, and the early Starship, it is easy to take potshots at this eighties version. But, Slick and Kantner are excellent song writers and they recruited two excellent songwriters/musicians in Pete Sears and Craig Chaquico. They still were one of the better Corporate Rock bands of the period.This DVD is about 60 minutes long and consists of 14 songs, mostly the Starship hits of the eighties. There are also nice renditions of White Rabbit and Somebody To Love. The songs are played with alot of energy and there are some nice, but short solos for Sears and Chaquico. But, since the DVD is only an hour, only the hits are included, and the group never really opens up. During this period, Sears used to perform an amazing base solo that is sadly missing here. A full concert DVD would have been much better.The real problem with this DVD is the opening and breaks that come every 3 songs. There is this cheesy sci-fi set with this moron introducing the songs. It looks alot like Mystery Science Theatre 3000, only not funny and totally inappropriate. It is bad enough to have it at the beginning, but with it inbetween songs, it really breaks up the flow of the music.",

One problem I had with this is that it is rather short - clocking in at a little over an hour. I would have liked to seen the entire show. Sound is decent - not great. The band seems to be having fun playing the songs, and it gives a nice snapshot of the band in their early 80's mode...just a few years before they released the god awful \"We built this city\"...and they went completely downhill. I think if your a fan of the band, you will find this well worth the money.

Too bad...when the first Starship album,Dragon Flywas released (Blows Against the Empirewas a Kantner solo project), it was such an improvement over the final Airplane albums that the future seemed bright indeed. The final Grace and Marty album,Earth, showed that the second incarnation of the Airplane / Starship / whatever might be running out of steam. The first Mickey Thomas album,Freedom at Point Zero, wasn't bad, but it soon became obvious that the Thomas-fronted version of the band was going after the MTV crowd with a vengeance.As theJefferson Starship. Platinum & Gold CollectionCD illustrates, there were a few tunes from the Thomas era that could be considered \"Greatest Hits,\" but when it comes to this DVD...an exercise in Grace being back in the fold and Mickey filling the Marty chair...it's not the band's shining hour.Jeff Tamarkin's excellent bioGot a Revolution! : The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplanereminds us of the fact that the peak (or valley) of Grace's alcohol abuse problems came during the Starship years. If you compare her stage presence here with the Airplane Grace found on theFly Jefferson AirplaneDVD, it's easy to see that she's become more annoying and less or a rascal and a rebel. It's also painfully easy to see how this edition of the band was able to morph into the hit-making unit (minus Kantner, of course, and \"Jefferson\" in their name, which he won the rights to in a court battle) that created the wretched \"We Built This City.\"The single greatest impression that I walk away with after watching this DVD is the fact that the band had been more enjoyable, more authentic, more film-worthy in the past. This crew had a job to do...make records, play concerts, make money, all while attempting to keep the \"Jefferson\" brand alive. This is commerce, not art. I own it because I'm a fan from theSurrealistic Pillowdays.But a new listener, one who may be a casual fan? If you liked the wretched \"hair pop metal\" that was MTV's bread and butter in the 80s...if you still have fond memories of that special Loverboy or April Wine concert you attended...this might be the DVD for you. If not, maybe the aforementionedFly Jefferson AirplaneDVD is the one you should buy.For those of you who love this stuff, Mickey Thomas still continues touring to this day as \"Starship\"...with no players from the original \"Jefferson Starship\" or \"Starship\" bands. He's become his own cover band, playing the songs you loved...or liked...or maybe didn't care for at all.",

The picture quality I would describe as being good for a vhs tape and the sound quality is equal to or better than an LP or casette tape. This is a concert dvd that employs some music video type effects with mixed results. Grace Slick hams it up for the camera's and some may find it distracting. There are breaks in the concert with Mike MacDonald playing a character called \"shortwave mike\", these are dreadful and I just skip through them.

For those without a SharQui instructor in their neighbourhood then this is the next best thing! Lovely job!",

    "review/text": "I really can't say enough good things about the SharQui style. As much as I love bellydance, an injury to my spine made me think I'd never be able to learn it. All the twisting and bending and dramatic moves are WAY beyond my range of motion. But with the SharQui style, the focus is all on the foundation and training your muscles to the proper posture and execution of the moves, then gaining the strength and endurance to be able to dance a routine. It's done wonders for my balance and given me quick, easy little moves to help loosen things up when I'm out and about doing regular things. Even though my roommates tease me about shimmying while we wait in line at grocery stores. It's totally worth it. :)In the routine on this DVD, Oreet talks you through the moves and occasionally gives reminders to help you check your posture. The repetition helps sink it into your head and, more importantly, your muscles. (I always wind up doing better when I stop thinking so hard and just let it go. As soon as I get too much into my head, I turn into my own worst enemy for messing myself up.)This second level is ABSOLUTELY more challenging than the first and adds more moves to the ones from Level 1. If you feel confident about doing Level 1 and are ready to kick up the difficulty level then this one is a must. You'll finish feeling totally worked over and definitely won't have to worry about not being sure if your muscles got a workout. And be prepared to get *sweaty!* The workout gets you WAY past glistening and right into man-sweat territory. It's without question a whole body workout, but the magic of technology means you can also just pick a quickie workout of arms or hips if you want. (I think that helps as a way to start working up to being able to do Level 2 start to finish if you are quiiiiite there yet, but want to work on getting to it.)So to summarize~ works a whole lot of muscles you didn't think you'd work, specific and controlled muscle isolation, absolutely a step up in difficulty from Level 1, and still 100% awesome fun. I've found my workout and hopefully the DVDs mean that lots of other people can find theirs too!",

Her hipwork is fine, but she has to gain more control over her upper body, especially the hands.In addition, I find it annoying that she talks too much and with agitation. I've seen several disks which offer you an option to mute the instructor and hear just the music; I couldn't find such a feature on this one. I've also seen other instructors that speak so charmingly that I don't mind hearing them over the music (they talk sparingly, too) - Ansuya, Jayna, Suhaila... In fact, I even enjoy hearing them.The workout itself is very good - mostly hip drops and shimmies - just those moves that your body asks for when you want a more straightforward workout and don't have time for figuring complicated moves. The music is mostly very good - a nice and inviting beat. However, I can't use this program because I don't want to pick up bad habits from the instructor and I can't tolerate excessive loud talking and counting.",

Now we add to the mix several suspects. The boyfriend (Brad Pitt) that seems a tad dysfunctional. Their old friend (Donovan Leitch) fresh from the psycho ward. And a whole cast of uniquely weird suspects that all had motive and opportunity.A pretty good array of dispatching tools are used, as people are being removed right and left. They left out the railroad tracks and the saw mill (close though) and the kitchen sink.I f you enjoy this sort of movie then you need to see one that does rings around this one with a similar scheme \"Student Bodies\" (1981),where they use Horse Head Book ends.Student Bodies",

I'm not sure why Adult Swim never picked up this show since it is much funnier than the last 6 seasons of Family Guy. Some comedies become really dated based on their material, but each episode of Clone High is based on everyday issues that never get old.The only annoying this about this DVD is the menu option - you can't get to the episodes right away, even if you hit menu it won't let you skip ahead. Why do companies feel we need to watch 10 previews and warn us about copy rights for the hundredth time?",

In fact, this show is up there right next to Family Guy. The show's refrences to sterotypical high school problems and historical refrences made me want more. The best part of this show was that the idea behind in, clones of famous figures in highschool with parents who try to be there for their kids but fail miseriably, was very very orignal and a head of its time, much like family guy. Maybe Cartoon Network will buy the rights to this amazing show and it'll come back from the TV underworld. But untill then, Im so glad that I discovered its on DVD, Im in heaven! And I NEED to know what happened after the flash freezer! Maybe a Clone College spinoff?",

    "review/summary": "A Wonderful Parody of the Teen Drama Genre and a Great Show",
    "review/text": "Clone High has a very original concept; back in the 1980s, secret government agents dug up some of the most famous and influential historical figures and cloned them. The clones were put in the care of foster homes, and are being secretly monitered by the government. By now, they are in high school, and are attending Clone High High School, where Principal Cinnamon J. Scudworth (Phil Lord) can keep his eye on them. Scudworth is employed by the Board of Shadowy Figures, the government group responsible for the clones, but he secretly plans to steal the clones away from the government for his own purposes. Scudworth is a stereotypical mad scientist; he is completely insane, speaks in an overly dramatic manner, and even built a robotic butler named Mr. Butlertron (Chris Miller).The main clones are Abe Lincoln (Will Forte), a nice guy who is very indecisive, Joan of Arc (Nicole Sullivan), a goth girl with a crush on Abe, Ghandi (Michael McDonald), Abe's best friend and party animal (he buckled under the pressure of living up to the original Ghandi), Cleopatra (Christa Miller), a sexy, self-absorbed rich girl, and JFK (Chris Miller), a loud, obnoxious, partier who is Lincoln's rival for Cleopatra's heart. Some other clones include George Washington Carver (Donald Faison), a science nerd obsessed with peanuts, Thomas Edison, an AV nerd, Ponce de Leon (Luke Perry), a Fonzie-esque guy who likes to litter, Vincent van Gogh (Andy Dick), a depressed art student (if you've seen Wedding Crashers, think Todd), and Buddy Holly (Neil Flynn), an aviator with an unsafe plane. In addition to the numerous clones, there are many original characters such as Toots (Donald Faison), Joan of Arc's blind foster parent, Wally and Carl (Faison, Flynn), JFK's gay foster dads, Abe's Foster Dad (Joe Flarhety), who is kind of a knock on Flarhety's character in Freaks and Geeks, Mr. Sheepman (Andy Dick), a history teacher and the first mostly human clone, and Glenn the Janitor (Flynn), who is Ponce's foster dad and a direct parody of Flynn's Janitor character on Scrubs (Glenn is the exact opposite of the Janitor on Scrubs, but Scudworth still hates him).The episodes wonderfully poke fun of the teenage drama genre. The episodes all deal with bizarre \"issues\", such as smoking raisins to get high, corporate sponsorship, the ADD epidemic, religious tolerance, incarceration, and the death of a friend. In fact, every episode begins with \"Tonight, on a very special Clone High\", and every episode has a \"Previously\" segment and a \"On the next...\" segment, neither of which are necessary, because the show isn't (for the most part) serialized. Futhermore, the relationship structure is similar to that of most popular teen dramas; the male protagonist (Abe) likes the sexy girl (Cleo) who is dating a jerk (JFK), while his best female friend (Joan) pines for him. Meanwhile, Abe's best male friend (Ghandi), is always trying to score with the girls, though he usually ends in failure. The animation is somewhat crude, though I think that it is (1) part of the show's charm, and (2) another way to poke fun at generic teen shows. I think that the cheap animation is supposed to make us think that this was a kind of quick imitation.A lot of the humor on the show derives from the fact that so many of the clones are nothing like the originals. Abe is indecisive, JFK is not a good leader, Ghandi is a party animal, Ghengis Khan is mentally challenged, and Nostradamus is a terrible psychic. Of course, there are numerous other kinds of jokes, ranging from current events references (such as the extreme marketing), great guest stars (including Marilyn Manson, Jack Black, John Stamos, and Mandy Moore), and parodies of classic cartoons, such as when Scudworth engaged in a Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote scenario with a skunk. Also, a lot of the humor is similar to that found on the show Scrubs, which makes sense because Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence is one of the creators of Clone High. And with the exception of Judy Reyes and Ken Jenkins, all of the Scrubs regulars did voices in this show. Also, a lot of guest stars on Scrubs also appeared in this show, sometimes as regulars (Nicole Sullivan, who does the voice of Joan of Arc, had a somewhat recurring role on Scrubs).Sadly, Clone High was cancelled after only one season. There was so much more they could have done, and so much humor to be had with yet-to-be introduced clones. It's sad that we'll never get to see the exploits of Abe and Ghadi or hear Mr. Butlertron call anyone Wesley again, but oh well. The show ended in a \"cliff-hanger\" which further parodied the teen drama. It's actually a pretty fitting ending for the type of show that Clone High is. Who knows, maybe someday we'll get a movie, similar to Firefly, but for now, enjoy these 13 episodes.",

    "review/text": "I've waited for three years for this show to be released on DVD. In that time I've had to make do with the complete series downloaded on my computer. But now that I have this set, I couldn't be happier.You may have read how annoying some reviewers find the the 90-second Teletoon commercial introduction to be. Personally, I don't mind it since it shows scenes from some of my favorite cartoons - Family Guy, Futurama, etc. Nonetheless, you can't skip past it (at least on my Sony DVD players) - but it's not that bad.What blew me away was the incredible transfer quality. I could not believe how sharp and colorful the show looked. Excellent job with the print, as the image quality looked just like that found on the Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, Family Guy volumes. In addition, I could not believe how great the audio sounded. Absolutely no noise.Regarding the audio, I was so pleased to see that all of the songs that originally aired are on this set. Clone High has such an incredible selection of songs that I was pleased to see that they were retained. Dashboard Confessional, The Get Up Kids, Saves the Day, Taking Back Sunday, Hot Rod Circuit, The Anniversary, Alkaline Trio - this show is an emo-lovers dream! Also, it's worth addressing the longer intro song. Having read about this change, I was prepared to hear it at the beginning of each episode - but I didn't realize how much I'd miss the piano version on Episode 10. Clone High has such a great theme song, and I missed this variation. However, a quick search on the internet will show that numerous sites have an mp3 of this song.Overall, this was an excellent packaging. I did miss not having any liner notes or some sort of insert in the DVD case - just think how great it would have been to include a retrospective, sketches, etc. Oh well. I don't think anything short of a second season will ever satisfy Clone High fans - but I think this release is pretty great.",

    "review/text": "Possibly the most quotable show in history (and about history).I came into Clone High a little late, I remember seeing the show on MTV at the time it was on (the no sleep episode), but didn't really watch it all till about 6 months ago, when I discovered most of the 13 episodes could be seen on youtube for free.That said, after seeing 3 episodes on youtube, I immediately bought the DVD. This is an awesome show, its wacky, immediately funny, and subversive all at the same time. It literally has something for everyone. There's immediate, stupid humor, historical humor, stuff thats much more subversive, parodies of everything from teen dramas to looney tunes to Benny Hill to Christmas specials and beyond.Its a shame that this show was shut down because it apparently offended Indians due to its portrayal of Ghandi. I can understand why Indians wouldn't like the Ghandi character, but seriously, they make a point several times of saying that its a CLONE of Ghandi. Oh well, pick a less iconic historical figure next time, I guess (though no one complained about \"Hesus Christo\").But the writing, seriously. SO good. These guys knew how to take a joke to its breaking point. They would run things about two beats further than they should, and it would end up super funny. Family Guy could learn a few things from this show.That said, I'm actually not sure how they would've worked a 2nd season. Over the course of 13 episodes, they had slowly driven the episodes so over the top (example: compare the amount of bloodshed on the first disc to the second disc) that by the end of everything I don't really know where they could've taken it. Any further and it would've been WAY TOO FAR over the top (a line they already were skipping across by the end of everything) or they would've repeated themselves. Either way, great show, but it had its own self-imposed limits. I suppose the cancellation makes it sort of a mini-series. And thats fine, I guess. It works perfect that way.Still, great parody of teen dramas, and great writing. Not only was I laughing my butt off, but by the end of everything I actually found myself caring whether or not Joan and Abe would get together. Pretty impressive that a parody show would still make its characters emotionally resonant.If you can get it for a decent price you totally should. If not, well, there's always youtube.POST SCRIPT EDIT: If you're a fan of Clone High and you haven't already done so, please go watch Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs. It was written and directed by the creators of Clone High. Its obviously a bit more family friendly than Clone High is, but it has the same sense of humor, the same ability to stretch jokes to hilarious proportions, and the same sharp eye for witty satire (this time taking on action-disaster movies). It features none of the cliches of most kids movies (no songs, no big stupid message at the end), and really plays as more of a straight comedy than a kids flick. Plus it was WRITTEN and DIRECTED by Mr. B and Scudworth, how awesome is that? Trust me, if you liked Clone High you'll like Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs.",

    "review/text": "The film it self is interesting and not very well done to normal standards, but who said David Bowie was normal anyways. He is quite odd and his music is a breakthrough in rock and roll music, because he has his own unique style that inspired many, including Roxy Music, Talking Heads, Alice Cooper, Elton John, Nine Inch Nails and even Marylin Manson and much more. This live concert is pure rock and roll and it rocks the house all night long, I was more in it for the music after I knew what I was in for. Its also great for background music while doing other things, like any other live concert video is for, because even I can't sit there watching the crowd flicker for over an hour like watching a good movie, so I just sit back and enjoy the music, because thats what its all about, the music! David Bowie rocks live and the Spiders were spectacular. This was their last performance together and it is very moving to watch the end and the crowds reaction when he says this is their last show. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars might have left, but Bowie still remains till this day. Great concert dvd from a even more great artist!!Also check out Song Remains the Same(Zeppelin), Live at Pompeii(Floyd), Pulse(Floyd) and Gimmee Shelter(Rolling Stones), and basically any other live concert by bands you love, because its awesome seeing them perform live, seeing them in action in front of thousands. In the words of Neil Young, Hey hey my my, rock and roll will never die!",

I absolutely worship David Bowie and have tapes I use to record every scrap of Bowie footage I can find on VH1 specials and the like. Naturally, I was thrilled to see this. The video was indeed a tad dark and blurry and the audio was worse (although it's a lot better on the DVD version than the VHS), but I didn't buy it for the songs. I know these songs, heard them a million times. It was the visual I was after, and I have seen *much* worse. I was mystified that anyone could have not watched it all the way through. I couldn't possibly have turned it off. Basically, I recommend this for anyone who is in love with Bowie, but not for very casual fans. But who would want to see concert footage of someone they're only mildly interested in, anyway?",

    "review/text": "Famously, but incorrectly, touted as Ziggy Stardust's &quot;retirement gig&quot; this legendary concert was recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon on 3rd July 1973 (it was actually after the 1980 Floor Show, on 20th October the same year that Ziggy bowed out). In common with the Sex Pistols 100 club gig, if everybody who claims to have been there actually was, then there must have been 100,000 in attendance.By no means well recorded - it's taken 30 years of mixing to get &quot;right&quot;, and in my opinion the drum sound is now even worse - it remains the definitive live Bowie recording. The Spiders were a wonderfully tight band and just the right side of messy. For those of us lucky enough to have heard the original recording, with Ronson's guitar overpowering everything, including, occasionally, Bowie's voice, this is a bit of a letdown. However, Bowie's voice is wonderful, with an effortless clarity that's missing from subsequent live recordings such as DAVID LIVE and STAGE.The video is by Pennebaker, famous for his Dylan fly on the wall documentary &quot;Don't Look back&quot;. Shaky camera work, and out of focus zooms, more often than not result in Bowie looking like a grainy red blob amid a sea of blackness. However, in my opinion this actually adds to the mysterious aura that Bowie built around Ziggy. It looks like the film had to be pushed quite hard to get anything out of it at all - this could possibly be the first grunge video! The Odeon looks like a huge, heaving cavern. It's a million miles away from the polished Glass Spider and all the better for it. Considering the state of the original print I was dubious as to whether it could be improved for this DVD release. It couldn't.Previously unreleased additions include the complete &quot;Width Of A Circle&quot;, some between song banter, and commentary by Pennebaker and Visconti. Unfortunately the additions are not what fans have waited 30 years for. Disgracefully, The Jean Genie/Love Me Do, on which Jeff Beck joined the Spiders onstage to play guitar is STILL missing. Whether this is down to a royalty dispute or Beck's embarrassment of his glam rags, I don't care, but the omission seriously undermines this release. It was, in many an opinion, the highlight of the show.Until the complete show is released, Bowie Fans will continue to feel short changed. Come on Mr Beck - sort it out!",

The picture is probably as good as it can get - being digitally mastered from 16MM film (which is not at all a favorite of mine). Sixteen Millimeter film tends to look grainy and blurry and it's shame now that this legendary musical performance didn't have a higher budget.The sound of the DVD is clear and strong. The best part for me was the commentary soundtrack by Tony Visconti and the director which is insightful; I learned a lot.The DVD also comes with a fold-up poster and mini booklet. It's a nice package for fans. I still claim that David Bowie's best LP is &quot;The Rise &amp; Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; of 1972. He hit his peak early on, but the surprising thing is how he managed to maintain a vibrant, and always fascinating creative impulse for many years afterwards. Whereas most artists would have disappeared after Ziggy's pinnacle, Bowie quickly kept us thinking, and rethinking the whole while.In my opinion, this is David at his peak. See a truly historic Rock &amp; Roll moment, captured on film forever, and now remastered on DVD for your home collection.",

As his sparkling-intense \"Ziggy Stardust\" alter ego, David Bowie didn't just sing songs about outer-space, he was FROM outer space as far as mainstream society was concerned.The magic of this concert is multi-fold. There is the poignancy of its being the last show. The musical mastery that came from a long tour of live playing. Then there is David himself, who as Ziggy Stardust is the embodiment of true freedom and liberation; who emanates the full sphere of his being as both a masculine and feminine individual in one body.Even today there are places in America where a man in makeup risks being beaten to death with rocks. In 1973 there were a lot more of those places; this film captures the full brilliance and courage of of David Bowie's talent as a counterweight to the \"normal\" of his time, which all too often was nothing more than a thin veil of civilization over a lurking, violent ignorance.",

He could be so ugly and threatening and then so unbelievable humane, transitioning from song to song. He was so compelling at this stage in his career as this junkie-that-fell-to-Earth with the fantastic songs. What happened? Is it the same thing that happens to all of us as we age and accumulate responsibilities? We used to think nothing of this epic, beautiful oddness but now it looks somewhat pathetic and it makes me a little bit sad.

All of the songs you want to hear are on this one--&quot;Space Oddity,&quot; &quot;Changes,&quot; &quot;All the Young Dudes,&quot; &quot;Suffragette City&quot;--and whatever the limitations of the film and its transfer to DVD, there is something to be said for seeing Bowie do these songs instead of just hearing them on CD. Of course, when he was dolled up as Ziggy Stardust, that was exactly the point. If you have ever enjoyed Bowie, then you want to at least give this film the once over.",

    "review/text": "Here it is, the 25th Anniversary Special Edition of D.A Pennbaker's film of Bowie's final '73 concert as his alter ego Ziggy Stardust film July 3, 1972 at the Hammersmith Odeon. Bowie's backing band at this stage includes Trevor Bolder- future bassist for Uriah Heep.For it's re-release the film has been remixed in Dolby Digital, greatly improving on the muddy sound of the original VHS edition giving it a rawer, more rockin' feel. Though Leonard Maltin only gives this one and a half stars out of four, this is actually a pretty good concert: I'm far from being a Bowie fanatic, so devoted fans will easily give this a 4 or 5 star rating. Even though Maltin's one of the most respected film critics out there, its still just one man's opinion so its not like anything he (or anybody else) writes is gospel.Songs include the rockin' HANG ON TO YOURSELF (which will blow your mind when you crank up the volume), CHANGES, SPACE ODDITY &amp; SUFFRAGETTE CITY, as well as a cover of Lou Reed's WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT.The DVD package also features a warning about strobe lighting FX (esp. during the song THE WIDTH OF A CIRCLE), so if you are sensitive to this you should take the necessary precautions before you make the decision to view this.DVD extras include Director's commentary, DVD ROM features with screensaver, photos, weblinks etc.I do have ONE complaint: the long, lingering close-ups of teenage girls crying over Bowie. How sappy can you get? Maybe they had premonitions about the TIN MACHINE album? I don't know. This is still a must for your DVD collection. Check it out.",

    "review/summary": "At last, a stellar sound mix pushes this movie up to 5 stars",
    "review/text": "For years the concert film \"Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders FromMars\" was infamous for its grainy visual look and absolutelyabysmal sound mix, which was particularly bad on the first foursongs. Which was a shame, since the concert was clearly excellent, featuring Bowie at an early performing peak with his \"Ziggy\" concept. Now, at last, with this 2003 rereleasethe film has been given a just sound remix by DA Pennebaker, whoexplains why the sound had always been so bad on previousreleases in the accompanying booklet.The difference between the old and new versions is literally night and day. Now the sound is spectacularly loud and clear,in 5.1 surround--I never knew it would *ever* sound this good.This increases one's appreciation of the concert 500%, and shows The Spiders From Mars to have been a great backing group, with Ronson of course a particular delight on his solos for classics like \"Moonage Daydream\" and \"Width Of A Circle\". The entirefilm is an homage to the glory days of glam-rock, when fanatical UK audiences would dress up in the glittery makeup and outfits of their rock idols and act out each line of the songwith them; the audience is truly a sensational thing to beholdin this film, as they seem completely mesmerized, almost as if they were under hypnosis (on the other hand, Angie Bowie's briefcameo at the beginning shows her to have been a supremelysuperficial, self-serving and annoying presence!).Every song is a classic, with some like \"All The Young Dudes\", \"My Death\" and \"White Light/White Heat\" that never made it onto a Bowie studio album, and others like the climactic \"Width Of A Circle\" that were greatly expanded. Bowie's androgynous outer-space image--replete with lightning-quick costume changes and some lurid interplay between himselfand Ronson (kneeling and licking the guitar during a solo, and so forth) was a phenomenon at the time and still pretty legendary, although in actuality the spectacle was relativelymodest compared to the concurrent antics of Alice Cooper orGabriel-era Genesis. But it is the audience which probably lingers on the most after every viewing--the like of which has never been seen since.The film also comes with a bonus poster, although personally I would've taken it without, at a lower price.",

It still gives the vibe and I do recommend it to anyone who loves Bowie during this time. This is really some of his best work in a time when many people didn't know what to make of him.Get it, set back, and wonder.",

It's a train wreck that you just can't stop looking at. David Bowie is unearthly...he seems to glow from within and I couldn't take my eyes off of him. He could be so ugly and threatening and then so unbelievable humane, transitioning from song to song. He was so compelling at this stage in his career as this junkie-that-fell-to-Earth with the fantastic songs. What happened? Is it the same thing that happens to all of us as we age and accumulate responsibilities? We used to think nothing of this epic, beautiful oddness but now it looks somewhat pathetic and it makes me a little bit sad. This movie captured a fragile moment in time and I am so glad that it's here to share with the upcoming generation of music and culture students. I hope they can appreciate it.",

Bowie is excellent as he sings all the tunes that made Ziggy famous and then some. It is also fun to see Bowie not at all taking his personal seriously and interacting with an audience that is completely turned on by the androgynus Ziggy Stardust. This is a must have for all Bowie fans out there. And if you think the title of my review makes no sense. Just watch the video and then you'll understand.",

    "review/text": "First of all, the film source they had to work with wasn't that good, so my expectations were guarded. My old laserdisc showed a great performance with horrible audio and video. The DVD restoration of the video is a considerable improvement over the laserdisc, but the audio improvement is incredible. At least you can listen to it now. When somebody re-releases something and I already have the laserdisc pressing, I have to justify buying the DVD. The uncompressed PCM of the laserdisc is often better than the DVD's audio even though the picture might be better (and that's not always to be assumed). I bought the DVD used for $16 from one of my favorite stores(after running back home first to read the mixed Amazon reviews).I'm pleased with my decision to buy this. My only audio complaint is that Mick Ronson's guitar is a bit to dominant in the mix, competing with Bowie's voice. Having said that, I've always appreciated the performance documented here. As a side note, the best restoration I've ever seen from a 70s concert film is the 2-dvd Ledzeppelin compilation. That is my new gold standard. Enjoy.",

If you don't love him, then well, he kind of looks like a freak, and this video won't change that impression. If you're a fan already, and particularly of the 70s songs in the vein of Cracked Actor, Width of a Circle, etc, then it's worth watching.",

It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan's 1965 British tour in &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin's &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace.",

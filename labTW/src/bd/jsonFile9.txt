    "review/summary": "THE GREATEST HORROR FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN - AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE - A CLASSIC",
    "review/text": "I cannot begin to tell you how utterly, deeply shaken to my soul, to my core being this masterpiece of horror cinema has left me. I have seen hundreds, thousands of movies. As of late, most of them fail to move me. Am I getting jaded? Used to the mediocrity churned out year after year? It could be.However...Watching this...this mind-blowing, visceral, roller-coaster into hell...NEVER has my physical body, my mind, and my soul been so ROCKED by a film with FEAR, HORROR, SUSPENSE, SHOCK. My senses elevated beyond all belief. I was holding on FOR DEAR LIFE at what I was witnessing upon the screen. I was genuinely and TOTALLY SCARED OUT OF MY MIND - I am not exaggerating, not in the slightest.This is an experience I have not had at the movies in AGES.So what is it about? I really don't want to tell you. The less you know about it going in the better. Seriously, I do not advise those with heart conditions stepping into the cinema and watching this. It is an experience so visceral, so emotionally gripping, so INTENSE, your very nervous system will be exercised in ways you never imagined movies were capable of. I for one, had stopped believing in the power, the ability of film to make me feel this way.The audience reaction I witnessed was unlike anything I've ever seen in my life - screaming, shrieking, jumping up from the seats, gasping for breath. This film is as close to a roller-coaster ride as you will ever experience. Upon U.S. release, I plan on seeing it SEVERAL times in theaters; it should be amazing just to simply hear audience reactions, to be in that charged of an atmosphere.Believe me as I tell you: this film WILL go down as a landmark, a classic, one that will be mentioned among the all-time greats: PSYCHO, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, etc.This film has already been released in the UK, and is in fact already available there on dvd. As of this writing I have not seen a date for U.S. release, but for its audiences-to-be I say this: you are in for an experience that you have only dreamed of, and I mean that literally. The sounds and images that are coming your way will stay with you for a very long time, as they still do with me.Technically, the film is outstanding. The cinematography is astounding, breathtaking. The execution of this production is one for the ages. This is landmark cinema, and I am only too grateful to have lived long enough to have experienced it.This is a film, if marketed correctly, will lock up $200 million US domestic EASY. Word of mouth, along with a shrewd release strategy will reap HUGE grosses. I GUARANTEE IT. It's THAT kind of film. People will want to see this more than once. It is just going to blow people away, you'll see.\"THE DESCENT\" is out NOW! I COMMAND YOU TO GO SEE IT!!",

    "review/summary": "EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE (AND I MEAN EXTREMELY)",
    "review/text": "I'm immensely happy that couple of times a year I come across such movies as \"The Descent\" although I can't remember exactly when was the last one. I heard that a new movie came out by the director of \"Dog Soldiers\" and that was enough for me to start looking for the flick. And I was very surprised having found out it's in theaters. I watched it two days back and was totally blown away. I heard different opinions about its flaws and so on, but hey, there ain't no movies without plot holes. And \"The Descent's\" flaws were the minor ones, you won't notice them if they are not looked very hard for.If you watched \"Dog Soldiers\" you can get the idea about \"The Descent\" meaning its mood and atmosphere - Neil Marshall can frighten the audience very well and that's a fact. Remote Appalachian Mountains, sinister woods, gloomy sky - all that work just fine. The distinguishing feature of this film is that all of its characters are females (the only male character is being annuled within the first 5 minutes of the film in a rather grizzly way). And they are not usual horror film stupid teenage girls who like to show breasts, shriek and then be killed brutally. They are quite reasonable women in their late 20-ies or early 30-ies, who can deal with extraordinary situations as it seems. And there are lots of them (situations) to come.Six friends find themselves trapped in a cave and try to get out. Neil Marshall brilliantly managed these cave scenes, moving camera through narrow crawlways - you really start feeling claustrophobic. I personally don't have problems with elevators, but always felt uneasy lying under the bed as a child, so in the theater I found myself covering with cold sweat while watching those scenes. And it's not just the cave that will make you sweat. After the first 50-60 minutes of the movie THEY show up, and THEY will give you much more creeps. But the main Marshall's achievement is that he made quite a realistic flick about feminine frienship. The film demonstrates what six girls would do in extreme circumstances. Of course they try to help each other, but finally you see they don't know whom to fear most - THEM or each other. For they all have different and at times difficult relations with some secrets as usual. This human relations theme adds a lot of substance to the movie. Another good thing is that characters don't make stupid things like in many horror films. We see girls can act bravely, fight furiously and not die shrieking stupidly. One day in life a situation may come when you'll have to make a torch out of your friend's shinbone, and these girls demonstrate us some people won't quail when they're in such an extreme situation.\"The Descent\" delivers to us a sense and mood of a real horror movie which is unlike latest PG-13 films. It's not funny for a second, it's brutal and obscure, it scares on all levels - it has suspense, fear of the dark, claustrophobia, fear of some unknown creatures, repulsion of seeing gore and guts.Speaking of gore - \"The Descent\" is very graphic and grim, American filmmakers don't dare lately to make their movies that graphic. I noticed that British and European in general flicks remain practically the only ones to really shock the audience.\"The Descent\" is one of the best horror pictures I've seen in my life (and I've almost seen them all), I'm definately buying it on DVD.UPDATE (3/4/06): Just got the DVD from England. It's one of the best editions I've seen. First disc is a feature itself with director & cast commentary and director & crew commentary, the second one is filled with extras: 40-minute detailed \"making of\" featurette, extended and deleted scenes (about 10 of them), blooper-reel (one of the most hilarious I've seen on DVDs), storyboards, stills galleries, cast and crew biographies, two trailers and a TV-spot.The movie's transfer is rather good, I was afraid it wouldn't since all the action takes place in the dark. Certainly a Superbit edition would be better (and I hope it comes out eventually), but this one is also pretty adequate.The menus are a real piece of art, I haven't seen many like these. Great work.Somehow I liked \"The Descent\" now even more than when I watched it in theater, believe me this DVD is just awesome. It will be a true gem of your collection.",

    "review/summary": "A worthwhile, suspenseful horror film from the director of \"Dog Soldiers\"",
    "review/text": "WHAT'S IT ABOUT?This review is the for widescreen, unrated DVD edition of \"The Descent\". \"The Descent\" proves that the road to redemption and the road to recovery are often paved with the bones of distant memories, ghosts and friends. Neil Marshall's first film \"Dog Soldiers\" inverted the paradigm for horror films featuring werewolves and cleverly used the template of \"Aliens\" creating a memorable beast all its own. Marshall now does the same thing for spelunking. One year after a family tragedy Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) and her buddies Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) and Beth (Alex Reid) meet up with three other women on their annual outdoor pilgrimage. In the past they've done climbing, white water rafting and other extreme sports. This year Juno has chosen the Appalachian Mountains and a series of underground caverns for them to explore. They get lost. Their friendships sour as they find they are being hunted by vicious creatures that have no fear.IS IT WORTH BUYING?Absolutely. If in doubt rent it but be aware that the \"R\" rated version has a slightly different ending than the unrated edition. The unrated edition seems to be the same as the UK theatrical release.IS IT WORTH WATCHING?Yes. While \"The Descent\" shares a similar setting to \"The Cave\", it's a close cousin to \"Aliens\" and \"Pitch Black\". It's one of the most suspenseful and best written films in the horror genre of the year. Writer/director Neil Marshall (\"Dog Soldiers\")creates characters that are memorable each with their own individual quirks and allows the actresses to inhabit their roles completely. Each character is not a faceless victim but has enough character development and scenes to make them interesting and memorable. Marshall also fills his film with references to other horror movies as a tribute to them--you can spot inspirations from \"Deliverence\", \"Alien\", \"The Thing\" and many other classic horror films/thrillers that inspired him. This is definitely a worthwhile horror film.HOW DOES THE FILM LOOK?Great. \"The Descent\" receives a gorgeous transfer to DVD. If you have a widescreen TV go for the widescreen edition of the film as the carefully composed images look truly beautiful particularly during the white water rafting sequence that opens the film and the foreboding drive through the Appalachian Mountains(actually shot on location in Scotland). The level of detail is remarkably sharp with surprising depth given how dark much of the film is. The use of light, darkness and shadows is expertly portrayed in this edition. Colors are right on target with nice warm skin tones where appropriate. Director Marshall also makes effective use of color, texture, light and darkness to drive home the dramatic effects of the film and they are rendered extremely well in this edition.WHAT EXTRAS ARE INCLUDED?We're given two audio commentaries with both effective and intelligent. The first one features director Marshall, producer Christian Colson, Editors Jon Harris & Tina Richardsen and the production designer Simon Bowles focusing on the technical elements of the film, how various effects were achieved, shooting on a soundstage vs. actual location shooting (the entire sequence set in the caves was shot on soundstages) and the effort that went into creating the careful mounting element of fear that dominates the film. The production crew commentary is fun to listen to even when they aren't discussing technical stuff as they're all friends enough to bust each other's chops.The second audio commentary features Marshall again with his female cast. While they do discuss the various technical elements that made the film so effective, they also focus on the physical challenges of shooting the film and the development of their characters.The short documentary \"The Descent: Beneath the Scenes\" allows us to be the proverbial flies on the wall; we see the construction of the elaborate cave sets, the design for the creatures and production issues that arose during the shot. Director Marshall discusses the change to the ending in a short interview and how the film tested with American audiences, his feelings about the changes and how it impacted the drama. A blooper reel is included as well as deleted scenes that elaborate on their characters relationships. A stills gallery and series of biographies round out the goodies in this set.We also get storyboard to sceen comparisons. Folks who purchase this film at BestBuy will get a second disc that was a featurette release in the UK on the make up/visual effects showing how they prepared some of the puppets for some of the effects, some of the gore effects and the preparations for the prosthetics in the film. The featurette runs about 12 minutes and because it's the only thing on the disc there isn't a menu to choose from. It's a pity that Lion's Gate didn't think to throw additional previews from other films on here as well as the original theatrical trailer.CONCLUSION:In a year of dreary remakes, sequels and bad horror films \"The Descent\" doesn't pretend to be the most original horror/thriller of the year but, instead, takes a conventional situation and twists it inside out with clever plotting and characterizations. This improved version features the unrated cut of the film, the original, darker ending of the film and enough extras to make you feel as claustrophobic at the cast did on the set during the shoot. Lion's Gate, Pathe and Marshall have done a top notch job with this release.",

The Grudge made me cackle with joy when the hairy ghost girl emerged, how funny! Nothing seem to scare me in theatre anymore, except for this movie. I didnt really know what it was about when I saw it, and I atually got goose bumps. It combines good acting with many types of horror. The horror of being trapped in a cave system and then finding out you are not alone in there! There are times when you feel your heart pace quicken because of the tight situations. Basically, just watch it and dont watch it alone! Make sure its dark and enjoy!",

    "review/summary": "Superbly Scary Moments. Falls short of a Classic.",
    "review/text": "`The Descent', a film from the UK written and directed by Neil Marshall has one of the most starkly scary moments, roughly about 20 minutes into the movie, that I have seen since I closed my eyes in the theatre 50 years ago rather than see the monster in the 3-D pot-boiler, `It Came From Outer Space'. But then, that may be just me. I add that disclaimer because the scariness of the moment relied heavily on claustrophobia, of which I have a slight case. But then, in the right situations, I suspect every generally normal person would begin to feel claustrophobic. This moment was so effective that I stopped the movie at that point and couldn't come back to it for nearly a week.The movie has a lot in common with the great Sci-fi horror classic, `Alien'. All major action takes place in a venue the human heroes of the story cannot, or at least cannot easily escape. The terror they face, aside from the isolation, is an unimaginably horrible, unreasoning, and relentless foe, driven by a totally alien (!) hunger to have our heroes for lunch. Both monster types are preternaturally quick and seem to have senses beyond the abilities of mere humans. The heroes are also short on anything that could be considered a viable weapon against the monsters. There is even the element of a traitor in the group of humans who is willing to give up a comrade's life to save their own. (The `Alien' analogue is far more ambiguous, as the `traitor' is an android who is simply following `company policy' over protecting his crew's lives. The ambiguous cross-purpose makes better tragedy than simple selfishness.)The question immediately comes up as to why this movie doesn't have the same great cache as that Ridley Scott masterpiece. Much of it has to do with superior production values. Scott had a much bigger budget, a cast of talented, seasoned and easily recognized character actors, truly shocking surprise scenes, and a great monster design by H. R. Geiger which has yet to be outdone. And, in spite of Scott's love of very dark scenes, his lighting was still far more skillfully handled than in the difficult scenes in what appeared to be a cave two miles underground.Writer Marshall skillfully camouflages this fact, but the movie still suffers from using some of the oldest horror flick cliches in the book. The enormously scary setup scene where the group of six English twenty-something women find themselves trapped in a previously unexplored and presumably undiscovered cave in the mountains of the Eastern US is established due to a colossally stupid mistake by the group's leader. This is not much different from a group of teenagers trekking off to the scene of previous group murders for which the perp has not been caught (See Friday the 13th ad nausaum). They are left totally to their own resources because the group leader brought them to this cave without notifying any authorities of their whereabouts and with no map or even special equipment suitable for a true exploration rather than a conventional spelunking excursion in a familiar cave.Needless to say, things go downhill from there. Leaving aside the complications introduced by the blind humanoid monsters, our heroes do few of the things one would expect them to do in that situation. They recognize that the batteries on their helmet lamps won't last forever, but they don't turn three or four (out of six) of them off to conserve the batteries. They also don't start a map of their progress as soon as they encounter a fork in the cave. The very worst thing is when they separate and some members of the party throw caution to the wind and end up with a broken leg, making the situation even worse for the whole party.I am sure the situation is capable of turning even the most levelheaded people to hysteria, but these are not callow (American) teenagers. They are experienced cave explorers with all the right equipment for routine and skills for negotiating virtually any situation you would find in large limestone caves. This makes their devolving into panic a little harder to understand. Of course, one can easily counter that they seem to pull it together until the blind monsters make their appearance. I can see this; except that the blind monsters are real wimps and far less plausible (given the premises of the flick) than our horrific Alien. Since they are blind, they literally walk over our immobile heroes who don't make a sound. But one would think that in addition to hearing, their sense of smell would also be heightened, and I'm sure the girls, after working up a sweat with all their exertions, would have been pretty ripe.Unlike the climax to `Alien', the ending to this film was almost totally unsatisfactory. It seems as if the least deserving girl escapes, then the escape is taken away from us, as it may have been only a dream, followed by an implausible hallucination with a birthday cake and candles.This has the elements of a great horror movie. It certainly has a better (even if a bit derivative) plot than `Saw' or `Hostel', or even most of the `Texas Chainsaw' remakes, but some pieces are missing, and the difficulties of filming in a cave lit by battery lights, flares, or torches are not entirely overcome.As befitting an independent B movie such as this, it has very good extras, especially the two voice-over commentaries. The commentaries reveal the surprising fact that almost all the cave shots were done in a studio and the opening shot as they rappel down the large cave opening was done mostly with CGI. The problem is that one good voice-over would have been better than these two weak commentaries, which tend to repeat themselves.If you are fond of good scary movies, there is no question that this one, in its own way, is scarier and more original than most, but it's use of the old familiar conventions catch up to it with a weak ending.",

    "review/summary": "How horror should be!",
    "review/text": "When walking into the theater Friday night I had high expectations. This film has been hyped up by critics of all people as one of the scariest films in the past years and that to me says a lot. I've been so disappointed lately with the slump in genuine horror films that I had all but given up in really finding a worthy scare...that was until I heard about 'The Descent'. Granted, there have been horror films of late that have proven to be watchable, to be intense and at times, yes even a little scary, but nothing that had my skin crawling. I wanted to feel trapped, helpless and alone. I can honestly say that throughout the majority of this film that is how I felt, even though the theater was packed and my brother was sitting right next to me.'The Descent' centers on a group of women who enjoy pushing themselves to the limit. The movie opens with three of them, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), Beth (Alex Reid) and Juno (Natalie Mendoza) rafting down some rapids while Sarah's husband and daughter watch in amazement. These girls are fearless...until tragedy strikes in the form of a freak accident that takes the life of Sarah's family. A year later the three girls meet again for their yearly adventure, this time in the Appellation Mountains for some caving. They meet up with three other girls, sisters Sam (MyAnna Buring) and Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and new addition Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), all of whom we have a few minutes to get to know, and then they're off. Juno is the leader of the group, she called the group together for their adventure and she serves as their guide. The only problem is she's not much of a guide being that she doesn't know the cave's they enter.Soon after entering these unknown, uncharted and undiscovered caves the girls become trapped when their point of entry caves in. Without a map these girls have to find their way out, find another exit by burrowing deeper into the cave. This fills the viewer with a sense of claustrophobia that doesn't go away until the credits role. The monsters haven't even shown up and you're already on edge. Everything around these girls is foreign to them, is a potential danger. They are forced to push themselves as far as they can go, to the point of wanting to give up for everything looks helpless. The viewer is also forced to feel this way. I had what I wanted. I felt trapped as they did, I felt helpless as they did, and once the creatures show up, and in a rush of panic the girls separate...I felt alone as they did.From the moment the crawlers show up the movie takes a frantic turn from increasingly creepy and atmospheric to intense and horrific as these girls fight to survive, let alone escape. As intentions are revealed between the girls it also makes things all the more horrifying for you don't know who to trust. If you can't trust anyone then you truly are alone. The pace doesn't let up once the creatures are on the screen, and your heart won't stop racing either. As some of the critics have pointed out, this is a truly horrific film with images that won't leave you anytime soon, and yes, while I was able to sleep alright and didn't toss and turn in fear I was haunted by what I saw. This is not a film for the squeamish, that's a fact not an opinion. Neil Marshall did a brilliant job directing this film, giving it the raw edge that true horror films need, giving it not only jump scenes with blood and gore but building a layer, a foundation of fear before the first drop of blood is shed. And the actresses need to be commended for proving to be believable as well as likable, never 'over-acting' but giving us the feel that this is really happening and that these women are really that petrified (as I'm sure even the manliest of men would be in that given situation). Amazing job all the way around without much of a single drawback.I do say 'without much' and I only say that because of the ending. Now I've seen the US version so I can't speak for the UK version that has a different ending I hear. The US ending, while not horrible, leaves you wondering what is really going on. I have my ideas, that of which I won't share so as not to spoil anything, but I will say that it reminded me a bit of the way I felt after watching 'The Ring'. The only drawback to that film was that the ending didn't answer any of our questions, it just added to the confusion. I felt that way after watching 'The Descent'...confused...but it's not really enough to harp on. The movie does enough redeeming work BEFORE the ending that it's easily forgiven.",

There are no women running around in towels or their underwear, no women needing to be rescued by a man; these women are tough and that's part of what makes this movie so engrossing.Set for no real reason in the Appalachian Mountains (was this some subversive move on the part of the writer/director as a commentary on contemporary US relations with Europe as most of the women are European?), this is a great tale that takes its time developing and delivers a great payoff. Hold onto your seats in the final half hour as things get very nasty very quickly. I have never been a fan of violence against women, such as in the recent remake of \"The Hills Have Eyes\" (which included a nasty rape), but I could handle it in \"The Descent\" because the women fight, and they fight hard and are not hapless victims. How often do we get to see that? Like - never.Great movie, but not for the claustrophobic. You'll become so involved with the movie that you'll feel like you're in the caverns with the women and it's not always a comfortable fit.",

Throw in a hearty measure of claustrophobia, coupled with some really tense climbing sequences, and you have pretty much a perfect horror movie. Relentless, bloody, and truly scary on many levels. Horror fans won't be disappointed.",

    "review/text": "Not to be confused with `Descent' a very bad sci-fi film starring Luke Perry.Neil Marshall (`Dog Soldiers') did it again. With much lower budget than most of the Hollywood films, Marshall succeeded in creating one of the most claustrophobic pictures in recent years. To be frank, I find Marshall's `The Descent' a bit too long, and wish that he cut the latter half of the film, in which I was amazed by one of the most disturbingly gory scenes I ever saw. Well, but it is impressive, and of that fact I am sure.From the opening chapter (that includes one shock sequence), we are to meet six females, amateur explorers going deep down into a cave among the Appalachian Mountains. When things are going well, one unnecessary step results in a roof fall which cuts off the way out.The basic rule to survive in this extreme situation is, as you know, to stick together all the time. The point of the film is that the explorers are not always capable of doing that. One of the merits of the film is its psychological nuances behind the behaviors of the people under the pressure, and the film is clever in suggesting that these explorers are going to get into a trouble in several of the scenes prior to caving.The second part of the film gives stress to another aspect, the `secret' of the cave which I should not reveal here. All I can say is that you are to experience the drastic change of the tone with more bloody fight and lots of gore.Technically the film is superb with the perfect lighting and sound effect that are both unnerving. Though scientifically Neil Marshall's story requires suspense of disbelief, and probably those who really enjoy caving expedition would say a word or two about the probability of the story, the fact that `The Descent' is a gripping horror film remains true.American version has a different ending. I saw the original British one, which I think is superior. I hope that you can compare them after the DVD release.",

    "review/text": "When I first saw previews for \"The Descent,\" I immediately wrote it off as a copycat wannabe thriller like \"The Cave.\" In fact, that's what took me so long to view this film. I figured that it would be just another dull spelunking horror flick. Boy, was I wrong. \"The Descent\" is one of the top horror flicks to come out in the last few years. The plot is simple enough: six ladies, all with varied intentions, head off to the Appalachian mountains for a weekend of spelunking fun. Once they hit the hole, however, they begin to discover a hidden agenda as well as some creepy, gel-skinned critters that are very, very hungry. The creatures begin to pick them off (as all good horror movie monsters do), but they don't do it quietly. In fact, these creatures are very vocal once they begin their attack. Who, if anybody, will make it out in the end?The cast is headed up by Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Jackson Mendoza. Both do a wonderful job with their characters, Sarah and Juno, respectively. The rest of the cave-hopping gang includes the talented Saskia Mulder, Alex Reid, MyAnna Buring and Nora-Jane Noone. American viewers will probably recognize Noone from her role in \"The Magdalene Sisters,\" although she has less hair in \"The Descent.\" All of the cast do a wonderful job with their roles and do manage to muster some sympathy from the viewers even though their characters aren't developed too deeply.The visuals in this film are breathtaking in two ways: the Scottish forests which double for the Appalachians are simply beautiful and the claustrophobic, dust-filled cavern squeezes tightly at even the most non-claustrophobic person's throat. Director Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers) knows how to highlight the vibrant greens of the forests and does so wonderfully despite the carnage that awaits underground. When the action does move into the dark, Marshall plays on the fears of the human mind by using limited visuals and near-constant dripping water, creaking noises, and violent growls, yelps, and screams. By cutting off the viewer's vision, Marshall notches up the suspense. He does sometimes rely on the \"boo!\" factor to get a few cheap thrills, but for the most part, Marshall keeps the suspense at a decent level and moves the film along at an agreeable pace.The DVD transfer is wonderful, with no flaws that I noticed. The colors of the forests, as I've bragged on before, pop off of the screen and blood never looked better. Special features include cast biographies, a documentary on the \"making of\" and other obligatory offerings. My favorite extra, and one that I suggest viewing after watching the film to lighten the air a bit, is the outtakes reel. The \"crawlers\" lose a bit of their fierceness in a hilarious bit in the outtakes.Overall, this is definitely one of the top horror films of late. Is it a classic? Probably not, but the fact is that when compared to other recent gorefests like \"Hostel\" and \"Saw,\" \"The Descent\" rises above them. This is a definite purchase for fans of films like \"The Hills Have Eyes\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\" Sci-fi fans will appreciate this flick as well. If you have a weak stomach or don't enjoy gory films in general, stay away. Also, if you're claustrophobic, you might not want to watch this either.",

    "review/text": "Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, \"The Descent\" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made. In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing. Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, \"The Descent\"\"The Descent\" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet. So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave. Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected. However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture. At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom. Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional. So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave. It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie. A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown. On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.Even though \"The Descent\" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.\"The Descent\" is unrated and contains violence and language.",

    "review/text": "Neil Marshall, hot on the heels of his brisk & entertaining were-wolf debut \"Dog Soldiers\", comes up with another character-driven monster movie in the tradition of the classics ( Night of the Living Dead, Alien ).The story starts with a tragic event for the main character, after which we are introduced to the women with whom she is involved in a amatuer adventurer's club of sorts. During some casual 'hanging out' the characters have a chance to interact - we see some of their strengths and weaknesses + get hints at the tensions between them. Their banter comes off as reasonably convincing, while the intro as a whole is peppered with ominous bits of forshadowing.After some bad choices leave them stranded in a subterranean cavern, things go from bad to worse as they discover they are not alone... and that the other inhabitants may not be human. As the terror mounts, attacking mutants, human flaws and character conflicts lead most of the group to their doom. In the end, the viewer must decide which is worse: the mindless beast or the darkest, deepest pit of the human urge for self-preservation.Neil Marshall provides thrills and shocks of the visceral, you-are-there variety; the result is lean, mean and morally ambiguous. The production values and effects are stripped-down, favoring physical reality instead of overdone CG.As someone who avoids 'slasher flicks' ( sadistic humans killing their own kind ) in favor of horror with monsters or supernatural elements, this really hit the spot for me - delivering the primal horror. I am officially adding Mr. Marshall to my list of horror directors to watch for.",

    "review/text": "In the same vein as Wolf Creek and the Blair Witch Project comes another tale about what happens when you get too adventurous. A group of six female friends get together to explore what most of them believe will be a relatively benign group of caves in North Carolina. They're getting together for the first time a year after one of them, Sarah, lost her husband and daughter in a car accident. The ladies feel that if they get back to their adventuresome ways maybe Sarah can learn to forget the past and start living in the present. What they don't realize is that one of the women, Juno (an athletic, no-holds-barred, go-for-it kinda chick), has decided that they won't go to the caves they'd planned to and will instead explore a group of unknown caves that aren't even charted. She's hoping that this adventure will bring them closer together and help them get a little female bonding time. What she doesn't count on is an avalanche leaving them stranded in a group of caves that no one has ever heard of, and a group of cave dwelling creepy crawlers who begin to stalk them once they're stuck.This movie was, in a word, terrifying. I screamed out loud at several points. It made me glad that when I take a vacation there are hotels and shopping involved instead of wilderness and mystery. Lions Gate has a knack for releasing disturbing thrillers about everyday people who just sought to make their lives interesting by going on an adventure, like in Wolf Creek and The Descent. All I can say is I know who to turn to the next time I'm in the mood for a scary movie. I'd definitely recommend this to the same people who enjoy those camping-trip-gone-wrong kind of thriller movies like Wolf Creek and the Blair Witch Project.",

    "review/text": "Good horror films aren't just tales about horrifying events. Instead, they are stories about people in horrifying circumstances.The distinction is critical, and that's where the vast majority of horror films fail. They portray events without relating the horror to the film's characters - or worse, they leave us not caring at all and able only to think about the graphic nature of the film.Some think \"The Descent\" is a movie about six women who 'descend' into a cave and are attacked by man-eating monsters. Yes, those things occur. But that is not what the movie is about. The monsters only catalyzed the most horrifying aspects of the story. \"The Descent\" easily could have been made without them.\"The Descent\" is a tale about friendship, adventure, and betrayal; it's about the women's descent into savagery as the price they paid for grim survival; and, for one, it's about a final plunge into madness. This film wasn't made in Hollywood, so don't look for a happy ending. While the US release has an outwardly softer ending than the British version, appearances can be deceptive.This wasn't a perfect movie. It did contain a few noticeable flaws, but the flaws faded to insignificance because of the power of the lean story-telling. I was surprised by this movie, pleasantly so. It was much more than I expected, and more than any recent horror movie I have seen for many, many years.I highly recommend it. And, having seen both the US and the UK versions, I believe the UK version is slightly superior. The ending is simply a better fit - although strangely, while the UK ending is outwardly darker than the the US version, in a very real sense, it also is a more merciful end to the tale.",

    "review/text": "A group of girls, some similar to the Powerpuff girls in prowess, get in lots of trouble when they embark on an adventure in an unchartered cave with some little surprises waiting on them deep in the cave. To be quite honest with you, I have lots of friends that are girls, and not one of them would even think about going into a cave like that! Anyway, \"The Descent\" starts off very well, and it is a very entertaining movie, overall. In fact, the very isolated and claustrophobic trappings of the dark cave scenes were really effective at creating a superb presentation of terror and horror movie atmosphere. The creatures that the characters encounter are quite creepy at first. However, when these girls start killing them like roaches, the creatures lose a bit of their prowess as horror movie villains so to speak.All in all, this is a good effort with only barely adequate acting...the characters really don't stick out with any kind of consistency except for Juno, who is undoubtedly the most flawed yet also the most interesting character of the bunch...that's not saying much at all, however. Of course, there is also the idiot, Holly, who is so impetuous you cannot help but be disgusted with her stupidity. Still, it is difficult to relate to these characters at least to some degree. Part of this may be due to the nature of the movie itself, how dark the setting of the movie is which causes difficulty (at least during the first viewing) in distinguishing the characters other than Juno, Sara and the idiot, Holly. This movie does suffer from lack of character development (which is part and parcel for a movie of this nature), and undynamic characters as a whole. The acting could have been much better, especially Sara played by Shauna McDonald, and, to be perfectly frank, the creatures realistically should have been more formidable against Juno and Sara. Just think about that for a moment...in reality, do you really think any of these women would have stood even a snowball's chance in hell at getting out of this cave alive with those things in there? I mean it's not like these girls are the powerpuff girls or anything...well, on second thought, as this movie portrays them, maybe they are or something like that I guess.Still, the creators of this movie were really on to something and the first half of the movie was very good! It's only that when Juno and Sara start killing the creatures like roaches in the basement that the movie's credibility as a horror movie becomes questionable in my opinion, and that is enough to bring the movie down a little bit. I think \"The Descent\" is a cute movie and worth owning, but it stars the Powerpuff girls-type characters, and that's kind of lame and unrealistic when you think about it, at least that is my opinion.Sure, girls can be tough as nails, but this movie goes too far in this regard. In reality, these creatures would have made minced-meat of these women. I mean Ripley in \"Aliens\" had a hi-tech machine gun to fight off the aliens...these girls had some climbing tools and they chop up the creatures like they are Japanese steakhouse chefs chopping up zoucine and onions. Indeed, the primal instincts of these women became apparent by the movie's end, but if the creators of this movie were looking for strict realism, these women would not have survived the first attack of these creatures. The fact that Juno and Sara are transformed into She-Ra type characters cheapens the movie in my opinion, at least to a certain extent. Still, \"The Descent\" is a pretty good horror movie and is an example of a movie that points the horror genre in the right direction, albeit very imperfectly.",

    "review/text": "I did, and did not enjoy this film. As a BIG fan of Dog Soldiers, I have to say that it seems like the director wanted to go one direction, and the studio another. The first half of the film that deals with ONLY the aspect of claustrophobia, separation, and a sense of impending doom, and anything that can go wrong in a cave is unbelievably intense. The thought of being hundreds of feet underground with a titanic amount of rock overhead is a terrifying concept. Then add being in a tunnel only high and wide enough to crawl through on your stomach, and THEN hearing the Earth rumble. Then after you escape the rockslide, you find out that you're in a cave that is not mapped and nobody is coming to look for you. Sounds intense? It is, and the director conveys it masterfully. Then for some reason, bat-people are thrown into the mix. Not just any bat-people, but blind, blundering, soft-skulled bat-people that are wearing the same costumes as the Ubervamp and The Master, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Not kidding, EXACTLY the same. For me, it really took the focus off of the true terror of the cave itself, and placed the focus on a threat that was really far fetched. I have a hard time believing that a race of cave-dwelling bat-people has occupied a cave system for, according to the film at least 100 years, going unnoticed in the Appalachian Mountains in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA?! It derails the attention from the isolation, claustrophobia, and terror of being trapped in the cave. Additionally, the monsters are shown WAY too much. The viewer can easily become desensitized since the beasts are forced constantly in the field of vision. The ending is very anticlimactic, and the \"dark secret\" that one of the women is harboring is painfully apparent from the first scene of the film. Overall, this film is worth a look, only one though.",

A spot-on hero's journey.That said, I dropped two stars from this DVD. Why? 1) I hate the UK ending. 2) Lionsgate, in their grand wisdom, decided not to release the theatrical cut in a widescreen edition. You can get it in full screen. What is that? Talk about a tease. I realize this is a subject that will be debated amongst fans for years, but if your going to release both versions of the film could you please put out a widescreen edition for those who want the film they came to know and love when they saw it multiple times in theaters?Look, Neil Marshall, in the \"DescENDING\" feature on the DVD states he prefers the original UK ending, but he also states he does like the US ending. Also, the US ending tested in the eighties among audiences while the UK version tested only in the seventies. Now, with the UK ending, this very original masterpiece of horror cinema falls prey to the same mistake most horror films of the last 5 or so years have fallen prey to. It still remains above schlock like \"Saw\" \"Hostel\" \"Cabin Fever\" \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre the Beginning\" etc. but falls too close along the same lines.This film dared to be different. Now, it's just disappointing. Release the American cut in Widescreen, please!",

Its a really dark film (yeah duh its in a cave) and the claustrophobia was done to good effect. I felt more queasy watching the movie cuz of that than anything else. One scene I felt was done very well was when the main character falls down into the monsters' pit, completely dark, and essentially uses the camcorder as her set of eyes. On a side note, the US ending is lousy...completely typical and cliched type horror movie ending.

    "review/text": "I liked this movie when I look at it as mindless entertainment. But all the reviews that this is new and groundbreaking are ridiculous. This movie is full of cliches from American horror that were predictable 10 yrs before \"the Descent\" was made. For one thing, echolocation isn't something that only works when something moves or makes noise. A creature with echolocation is able to spot prey even when it is inert and silent. Another thing: so the creature can kill moose and wolves? But 95 lb Asian and British women armed with nothing but a pickaxe and a collar bone can take down a dozen without so much as a scratch? And get this: these women can kill these creatures even after her throat's been slashed.The characterization is nonexistent in this movie. These women go from frail Englishwomen to full-blown Green Beret Rambos? Director Neil Marshall has obviously been influenced by Rambo: the cave scene reminds me of First Blood's cave scene. The scene where the wolves fight the soldier's in the forest in \"Dog Soldiers\" is reminiscent of Rambo's forest scene against the cops. But using the Rambo influence is implausible here. These women have never fought these gollums before, let alone knew these things existed, yet they are able to defend themselves skillfully against a swarm of them? Right.If you watch this movie for entertainment purposes, it's good. But don't listen to the whole \"it's new and innovative\" talk from some positive reviewers. Virtually everything non-Hollywood is considered innovative. It's part of the whole \"bash Hollywood/praise non-Hollywood\" scene that's popular these days. To act as if the Descent isn't swamped in Hollywood horror cliches is ridiculous. Lionsgate helped promote this flick. People wanna bash the so-called \"American ending\". That's what helped the hype. This film gained notoriety based on the \"American ending\" controversy. This is true because all of Neill Marshall's other movies (except Doomsday...bleh) aren't nearly as popular as \"the Descent\". So shouldn't Marshall be grateful the controversy hyped his movie? It's not as if the ending was a big deal. So she smiles at the end. Big deal. Neither endings did nothing to the poor (or lack of) plot and characterizations. Who cares?Like I said: entertaining as far as regular nonsensical horror goes? Yes. Groundbreaking and innovative? No.",

Things start out pretty slow, but I don't mind when filmmakers take their time to develop their characters and lay the groundwork for what's coming. That's not what they did. You get an hour of bad dialog between characters that are nearly indistinguishable while they explore a cave. They're all more than a little bit irritating, so by the time something actually happens you're trying to figure out which one you hope gets it first (my pick got it, the only part of this film that wasn't dissapointing). Gollum-like monsters begin chasing the girls around in typical horror movie fashion, and we discover two of the girls have some kind of innate ninja abilities that allow them to fight off large quantities of Gollum-monsters. The rest of the girls buy it, but that doesn't really matter because you can't tell them apart anyway. The movie ends without giving any closure, but kind of implies that maybe not everything actually happened. You know, just so people will confuse the lack of plot for some kind of mystery they need to figure out.In short, this thing is plagued with characters with no depth that routinely do unbelievable things (even by horror movie standards), scares that are all created by cheap camera tricks and editing, and a story that tries to be more than what it is. People have said it really captures the claustrophobic experience of being trapped in a cave, but that's really unavoidable when you're movie is in a cave. It's like saying Jaws really captured the wetness of the ocean. That's great and all, but I'd rather they captured the experience of an enjoyable movie.",

    "review/text": "Six women go spelunking...and find flesh-eating beasties.Such is the basic gist of THE DESCENT. The film is very-well done; the cast of relative unknowns are all believable and relatable, and writer/director Neil Marshall certainly knows what he's doing. The atmosphere is prevalent and truly frightening; while the film isn't necessarily claustrophobic (maybe it is; I've never been very claustrophobic myself), it is certainly a \"close\" picture, thrusting you right in there with the characters as they go through this living hell. You're on the edge of your seat the whole picture, never quite knowing what'll happen next, and it all leads up to a truly haunting finale.Then why the three stars? Because it bugs the hell out of me whenever a movie shirks its potential greatness to become something less than what it is. There is tremendous talent behind this film--the cast, the cinematography, the writing, the directing--which makes its shortcoming all the more regrettable. The film's first half is fantastic--part Tarantino, part \"Alien.\" The cave system itself is terrifying, and the audience is frightened right alongside the cast. And then...it becomes something of a zombie film set underground. Not to say these creatures are zombies; but that's what they come off as--flesh-eating, fast-moving, blind (yet somehow with functioning eyes?) zombies. It's a terrible shame; if there weren't so many of the creatures, or if the emphasis wasn't so fully upon them in the second half, their presence could be justified (if if there existence never truly is; there are a few hints as to their origins, but honestly, the film would have been more believable if the creatures' origins were left completely unspoken).Thus, THE DESCENT is a great film that winds up being only a mediocre one. It's still a must-see for horror fans, as the first half of the movie especially is truly outstanding. Certainly it's worth watching to reassure yourself that there is true talent working in the horror industry today, with a writer/director (and cast) who knows how to relate to you, to entertain you, and to terrify you.",

Perhaps reading the book first is why I was so disappointed with this movie. The two have almost no connection except for the \"monsters\", and the idea of being underground. The movie had very few \"suspenseful\" scenes and had to rely on shock value most of the time.It did, however, create a strong atmosphere of being secluded and closed in, better than any underground movie I've ever seen. I literally began to feel the claustrophobia come over me from watching some of the scenes, but that was the only reason to give this movie any stars.It has gore for gore, the plot is not well thought out, the acting is only so-so, and it has a typical female heroine. The ending also leaves alot to be desired.In conclusion, read the book and see how great this movie should have been!",

    "review/text": "Six women go inside the Appalachians mountain on a expedition to find the mysteries of the cave, a rockfall blocks their exit and they go on to find a way to get out and soon discover a race of ancient flesh-eating creatures for they must fight their way out to the secret exit that lies somewhere in the cave.A claustrophobic and atmospheric British horror thriller shocker from Neil Marshall (director of the suprisingly great \"Dog Soldiers\") delivers all the thrills of a rollercoaster in this movie. The acting is quite good and there's some shocking gore in the unrated cut, it's a heart-pounding and gripping thrillride that never lets go and pushes you over the edge. Originally released in 2005 in foreign countries, it came out here in the U.S. last year and became a minor hit for LionsGate with good reviews and i believe this is a new horror classic of the new era and a must see.This unrated widescreen director's cut DVD contains footage of gore not shown in the R-rated cut and has cool features like two audio commentaries, a behind the scenes featurette, deleted and extended scenes, storyboard and scene comparisions, stills gallery, interview with the director and Bios, a must have for the horror collection.Also recommended: \"The Hills Have Eyes\" (1977 and 2006)\", \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", \"Re-Animator\", \"Slither\", \"Predator\", \"Alien\", \"Aliens\", \"Demons\", \"28 Days Later...\", \"28 Weeks Later...\", \"Night of the Living Dead (1968)\", \"C.H.U.D\", \"From Beyond\", \"Evil Dead 2\", \"The Hills Have Eyes 2 (2007)\", \"Slugs\", \"Stephen King's IT\", \"Saw Trilogy\", \"Bloodsucking Freaks\", \"Grindhouse\", \"Vampire Hunter D\", \"Underworld 1 & 2\", \"Blade Trilogy\", \"Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)\", \"Day of the Dead\", \"Land of the Dead\", \"Cabin Fever\", \"Hostel 1 & 2\", \"Battle Royale\", \"Shaun of the Dead\", \"Street Trash\", \"The Toxic Avenger\", \"Undead\", \"Demons 2\", \"Inferno\", \"Ichi The Killer\", \"The Thing (1982)\", \"Resident Evil 1 & 2: The movies\", \"Dog Soldiers\" and \"Dagon\".",

    "review/text": "I had reasonably low expectations of this film at the onset,since it takes quite a bit to actually unnerve me and the more recent \"horror\" films of late have been quite laughable. There are a few exceptions,Hostel entertained my gore side,Saw 2 was just a cool horror movie,and The Hills Have Eyes was a good horror/suspense flick. I have yet to be entertained on more than one level which is why I guess its hard for me to imagine a horror flick that will truly hold my interest and unnerve me, however slightly,like the first Alien movie did. I must say,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this movie. Once again a low budget movie by the director of Dog Soldiers which was pretty darn good, and not a notably named actor in the bunch. The acting was pretty solid and the story was adequate enough that I didnt lose interest during the first half of the film,which was all leading up to the meat and potatoes. I am not like some reviewers and dont really care how the group of women met,it was evident to me they had been friends awhile and that was sufficient. It was established well enough that there was a strong bond between the characters,and just enough information shared about each one to allow for some empathy at their imminent demise. The real treat of this movie starts about halfway through,after they have been trapped in the cave and it becomes clear they are not alone. The level of confinement and paranoia is communicated quite well to the viewer,and the feeling of complete claustrophobia at times is very potent indeed. The gore was not overdone and not understated as in Dog Soldiers,and although the creatures immediately brought to mind Gollum from Lord of the Rings at first glance,further inspection shows them to be quite frightening. I think the real treat for me was the subtle plot twist toward the end,and after building to a violent crescendo the movie hits you with another little surprise treat. All in all Id say I was very entertained by this movie and found myself to be quite satisfied with it,to the degree that I would certainly watch it again. If your a long time horror fan like myself and not all that hung up on some lenghthy character development,I am sure this movie will be a winner with you as well.",

Just more proof that the great horror films & the great horror film Directors are comeing from the world of independent films. Even though the concept isn't so fresh it seems that everything else about it is. The cave creatures are brilliantly gruesome & realistic(great make up/efx). Even with all the mostly dry & un-original remakes out there,the last 8-9 years has still produced some of the best horror films ever & \"The Descent\" is truly the final seal of approval that we horror movie fans will look back at the turn of the century as a great era in horror movie history let alone movie history in general. If I'm Alive 20 years from now I will be so glad to say I saw this one in the theatre. A masterpiece!",

    "review/text": "I was leery about seeing this film. I like a good scare and gore doesn't bother me. But what I don't like is cheap exploitation. Lion's Gate has previously released stuff like SAW, HOSTEL and WOLF CREEK, which are all graphic, but more to the point, very unpleasant to watch. Unpleasant in a way that makes you feel like you just watched something very unseemly and need to take a shower.So I heard some good buzz about THE DESCENT, but still felt trepidation. I'm glad I ignored my instinct in this case. THE DESCENT is in many ways the best film of the summer. It is promising to deliver something, and it delivers and then some!! Most other summer films (much larger) either promised and fell short (such as POSEIDON or MI:3) or promised and came close to achieving (X-MEN 3 or PIRATES 2). THE DESCENT, while modest in scale, budget and ambition was a stunner.You probably know the basic story, but quickly...it is about 6 British women who come to America to explore a cave in the Appalachians. Only what 5 of them don't know is that their 6th friend has purposely led them to a scarcely known, totally unexplored, off-the-map cave with the goal of getting to name the place after themselves.Surprise, surprise...the plan doesn't go so well. They get into a great deal of trouble, and in many ways, the scariest part of the film is when you are actually able to get a sense of what it would be like to be about a mile underground, in an unmarked cave, with your only known way out hopelessly blocked, and no idea of what lies ahead. It literally made me shudder. Through much of the film, nothing \"supernatural\" happens, and frankly, it was a pretty darn exciting bit of work even then. But finally, the cave-dwelling mutants who will apparently eat anything they hear are introduced...and all hell breaks loose.The confrontations with the mutants are horrific, noisy, sometimes graphic and yet somehow shot with a just a bit of taste and restraint. That's not to say that blood and bone doesn't spray, that horrible disembowlings don't ensue, etc...but the dark of the cave leaves most of it somewhat to our imaginations. We see glimpes of the grotesque, but not all of it. The camera doesn't linger over the gore...there's too much else going on.The best thing about the film, in my opinion, is that all 6 of these women (all very different characters) are intelligent, witty, smart and atheletic. They don't make too many stupid mistakes. There are moments when their athleticism is brought to bear, and it is refreshing convincing. These actresses, who no doubt trained and buffed up some for the film, don't LOOK like actresses who just trained and got buff for a film. They look like people who know what they're doing. And while the director and writer don't take a lot of time to establish deep characters (there is a cliched scene early on when they all get together at the cabin, get drunk and laugh when we get to sort of see each of them in the daylight and know who they are), we still emphasize with all of them...even the \"villian\" of the piece. I liked all the performances, and all these women should feel proud to have been in a \"slasher\" movie where they give back nearly as good as they got.The dynamics between the women are pretty interesting as well, and it's remarkable just how cold-blooded they are allowed to be towards each other. This isn't a film where the survivors get together, despite their bickering, and find the way out through the monsters. They separate, they turn on each other, they form loose groups and unform them as well. It's a great way to add richness to what is afterall a genre film we all know pretty well.I HIGHLY recommend this film. Why no 5th star? Well, the very end of the film is not so great (although I'm sure the original ending will be restored for DVD) and the cabin scene was less than stellar on the part of the director. But the other 80 out of 85 minutes are true edge-of-your-seat stuff. I was pretty well drained by the end, and so was my wife...who also enjoyed it a great deal.",

But, I will admit---the final scene left me jumping out of my seat. Perfect ending---although not \"the original\" extremely downbeat ending that was shown in the U.K.Very violent, VERY GORY, and very scary---if you like physical horror that gradually descends into psychological horror---this film is for you.

And just as you're about to be eaten alive, you wake up sitting straight up in bed, soaked in sweat, your mouth open in a silent scream . . . . . . . . . . . . . sorry, this movie won't take you there. This had good scare potential -- trapped in a cave with unknown creatures lurking about, but it went downhill once the real action began. Yes, the scenes are dark & shadowy. It's in a cave! I don't have any complaints about the lighting. It adds to the atmosphere. Anyone, who's been in a cave, knows that lighting and filming in a cave, while maintaining realism would be challenging. I agree with some of the other reviewers -- the Enquirer's bat boy was stolen! The cave monsters were a little too humanoid, and lacked the physical adaptations for their apparent abilities -- claws, large ears, large, powerful jaws, large canines, maybe some sticky, gecko-like feet, etc. Sure, these women might be physically fit, and it might've even made for some good film footage, but they'd be no match for prehistoric, meat-eating, underground cave dwellers! The last scene between Sarah & Juno -- what the?! After Juno went back for Sarah, no less! You wouldn't wanna go spelunking (or anything else) with friends like these. Vengeance for what? The accidental death of another friend as Juno fought for her life while everyone else fled like rats before an earthquake, simultaneously abandoning an injured friend and leaving Juno to fight alone. It's each woman for herself in this movie -- a good way to get yourself killed. And if none of that makes this movie annoying enough, there's still the wishy washy ending. You're left wondering how it really ended. Did she or didn't she?? A big let down after so many rave reviews here. Doesn't live up to the hype.",

I do not want to spoil anything for you but I think even without a monster menace the claustrophobic feeling and the attempts to escape would have made a pretty good movie.The filmmaker goes that extra mile though and inserts these creatures into the story. You will learn about their origin and it is very cool. I really dont think I have felt a sense of dread and hopelessness as strongly as I did in this movie. The poor girls are constantly assaulted by the environment and flesh eating monsters and although you feel bad for them, these girls are pretty hardcore and do some ugly and violent things to survive......you go girls.If you are in the market for a new horror movie...pick this up without delay. It is definitely in my top 5 and will probably be in yours too.",

I will tell you that its about a group of women who, every year, go on some sort of extreme sporting expedition. This year, they decide to go spelunking and what follows will test their friendship and their lives like no other event could. That's about as much as I want to tell you. A lot of reviews and websites detail some things that happen about 30 minutes from the end of the film. And this is a film where the less you know, the better.Using pitch black tones with just hints of light, Marshall creates a great cinematic tapestry in which to thrust his characters. In this way, he creates a very claustrophobic atmosphere and presses down on you. He also plays with some of the horror conventions (like using a camera, for instance) to great and chilling effect.I have been watching horror films since before I really should have. While there have been films in which I have \"jumped\" or was spooked by something (loud noise, quick image or what have you), this is the first film in which I have shouted. In fact, I almost fell out of my chair. And from that point on, I was on pins and needles. It was genuinely thrilling to finally have a movie terrify me to the point where I just sat there and watched the credits roll for a few minutes.I would definitely recommend this film to any and all horror fans. It is probably the most terrifying movie I have seen in a very long time. And is hands down the best horror film I have seen in the last year.",

Never has a movie been so bleak since \"John Carpenter's The Thing\". Neil Marshall first made his mark on \"Dog Soldiers\", another excellent film, and the direction here was even more fantastic. The all-female cast was perfect, just spot-on, and the creatures both looked and acted like no others I have ever seen. The gore was immense, absolutely amazing, you will do yourself a favor by picking up the unrated version of the film. This movie is beyond your typical hack n' slash horror film, the characters are so greatly fleshed out you really get a chance to know and become attached to them. None of the women are just disposable gore fodder. Bloody, disgusting, frightening, claustrophobic, amazing. This is one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite, ever made.",

    "review/text": "I guess I'll start out by saying I went into this film with extremely high hopes, which is something you should never do. I had read countless great reviews of the film in every single horror mag/movie site over the last few months, some of them even going as far as to say it was the best horror thriller since Alien. Hearing it being compared to Alien had me both curious and worried at the same time. As far as I'm concerned, the first two Alien films are absolute masterpieces, and I didn't think it was right of a reviewer to give people such high expectations.How wrong I was, and how right those comparisons were.For once, a film not only lived up to all of the hype, it was even better than advertised. I can say right now with confidence that after only one viewing, this is one of my top five horror films of all time. I'm also going to have to redo my top 10 films of all time because The Descent is most certainly deserving of being in that list as well. Writer/Director Neil Marshall really has given us the first ORIGINAL bona fide classic horror film since Alien. I agree with that statement 100% now after having seen the film. I raved about The Hills Have Eyes remake that was released back in March, but the bottom line is that it was a remake. Alexandre Aja did a phenominal job with that film, and I take NONE of the praise I gave it back, but the fact that it was a remake disqualifies it from being considered the Best Original Horror Film Since Alien. That is unfortunate because Hills was fantastic, but that's the facts. Besides, it makes it easier for me anyway since I thought both films were phenominal, and would prefer not to have to choose between them.As far as this film is concerned, I want to first say that the TV/Radio ads are painting this film to be something that it definitely is not, which is kind of annoying. This film has nothing whatsoever to do with Saw or Hostel, other than the fact that it was distributed by Lions Gate. The similarites end there. I liked Saw, loved Hostel, but quite simply put this film is flat out better than both of them on every conceiveable level. No disrespect intended to my MySpace friend (and Hostel director) Eli Roth either ;) This is not a torture film. It is actually a monster film, but a monster film like none I have ever seen. The story is that six women get together once a year and do different outdoor adventures. A year after one of them loses her husband and daughter due to a horrific accident, they get together for their yearly adventure to try to help her get over the tragedy. This particular year they decide they want to go spelunking, which is exploring caves. When they get down there they find out there are more to be afraid of in said caves then bats...I thought the character setup of all six women was fantastic. They are all very believeable characters, and there isn't a bad actress in the bunch. I'm not sure I've ever seen a horror film where all of the characters are women. It definitely puts a different spin on it, and was a brilliant idea in my opinion. The pacing of the film is excellent as well. Marshall moves things along quickly to get to the meat of the story, but not so fast that you don't get to know each of the characters. A lot of times in horror films you don't really get to know the characters, so you could care less if they live or die. Not in this film. The minute I started feeling genuinely sad for one of them in a particularly gruesome moment was when I knew Marshall hit a homerun with this flick. I don't think I've ever had that happen during a horror film before, and I doubt it ever will again. You definitely CARE about these women, and when bad things happen to them, you have a different reaction then with 99.99% of the rest of the horror films I've seen. There is no winking at the audience going on in The Descent. This is horror that is meant to be just that, horror. Marshall went for the laughs in his first film, Dog Soldiers, but not this time around. This film is deadly serious and that's what makes it so wickedly good.All of the stuff in the caves is so wonderfully shot that I still can't believe they were sets. I would never have known had I not read an interview with Marshall saying they were. The way the cave sequences are shot makes you feel like you're in there with the characters. I'm wondering how that effect will translate seeing it on a TV screen when it comes out on DVD. I'm sure some of that effect will be taken away, but I have a feeling it will still feel very claustrophobic. That is obviously what he was going for, and he definitely hit the mark.Marshall takes his time getting to the creatures, which is the right way to do it. If you reveal your monster(s) too early, the payoff is never quite as effective as it is when you have a slow buildup. The absolute best creature reveal shot I have ever seen introduces the \"crawlers\". It is done using night vision, and is one of the spookiest images I've ever layed my eyes on. Let's put it this way, I consider myself to be pretty immune to most \"scary\" visuals, but even I felt a bit unsettled. And it had no gore to speak of! Just the odd night vision lighting, a fantastic creature design, and an overall creepy feel. Marshall said that he wants to keep his films as CGI Free as he can, and chose to go all practical with the creatures. No CGI on them to speak of. He did this flick old school, and the results were nothing short of spectacular. The creatures are supposed to be the evolution of cavemen who were trapped in this cave, and adapted to their environment. Like bats they cannot see, and use sound as their way of tracking their victims. They slightly resemble the vampire from Salem's Lot, so I was not at all surprised to read that the creature designer was a fan of that film. The thing about these creatures that I really liked is that I could actually see their existence being possible. Humans technically are animals, and all animals can evolve to adapt to their surroundings. It's entirely possible that this could have happened in an undisturbed cave. You never know. I know this though, I'm not going to be the one to find out! Aside from the creature factor, those caves are extremely dangerous, and I would get entirely too claustrophobic to set foot in one. This flick has soured me on caves just like JAWS did for people in the 70's with the ocean!There are also some very interesting plot twists that go on between the characters which make the story that much more interesting. I won't go into any spoilers, let's just say this is not your average \"people running from monsters\" scenario. There are some underlying tensions that make the situation the characters are in all the more real. And all the more tragic.The only complaint I have is directed at Lions Gate. Marshall couldn't do a thing about this, so I refuse to let it affect my review of his film. Apparently Lions Gate decided that they wanted to cut the final minute of the film out to end it on a more \"American Jump Cut Horror Ending\". I saw the remaining minute that was cut out on YouTube, and I have to say they made a big mistake doing it that way. The original ending was absolutely fantastic, and much darker. It tied the film together perfectly and should never have been cut. Shame on you Lions Gate. That was the director's vision and you should have kept your big noses out of it. The American ending by no means ruins the film. It's just annoying knowing this original ending is what was intended, and was foolishly taken out for no good reason at all. Having said that, PLEASE do not let that affect your decision of seeing this film in the theater. It absolutely HAS to be experienced in the theater to be fully appreciated. I am going to post a link here to the original ending. After you have seen the film, you can come back here and check it out. I guess it's not that big of a deal though. In a recent interview, Marshall said that the American release of the DVD will absolutely have the original ending included, so this will only annoy me in the theater.I've used the \"rollercoaster ride\" analogy in film reviews before, but never has that analogy been more perfect than with The Descent. This flick should be shown at every film school on the planet to teach students the art of building tension. Marshall does this so well that I'm a little shocked this is only his second film! Think of the biggest, baddest coaster you've ever been on, and the feeling you had when you got off. That's the feeling I got when this film ended. It is tightly directed, beautifully shot, extremely well acted, and deliciously scary. I've seen a lot of great horror films in the past couple years, but The Descent has done the antithesis of its title. It has ascended to being one of the very best films (horror or otherwise) that I have ever seen. Thank you Neil \"Savior Of Horror\" Marshall for this horror masterpiece. I'll be enjoying it for many years to come.",

    "review/summary": "A wholly different film from the asinine US cut",
    "review/text": "I honestly don't understand the ending in the US version versus the original. Not only does it defeat the purpose of the *ENTIRE* movie and Sarah's character (much like I Am Legend, whose film adaptation made the title insensible), it's not scary, it's not interesting, it's not profound, and it's in no way an improvement over the original. It degrades the film into nothing more than a gorefest because it leaves out the absolutely critical final shots that explain everything. One has to wonder who got the idea to leave out the final minute in the original, which was nothing more than a single shot that explained literally everything about Sarah and her motives throughout the entire film. It was the conclusion to a long series of strange happenings, and it made perfect sense. The US version doesn't make sense. At all. The last minute defines the point of the film, but when it's taken out, it makes the entire premise insensible. The loose ends aren't tied up, Sarah's motivations aren't revealed, and we get what amounts to a useless and cheap screamer ending that makes no sense whatsoever. Ending changes are very rarely this senseless, as if the director or studio must have thought it was a good idea for some reason none of us understands.Having said that, this is a truly excellent flick about the psychological aspects of real horror among normal people caught in a bad situation out of good motives. It particularly focuses around Sarah, who we see as the only survivor in a gruesome car crash that kills her husband and daughter, but she survives. The rest of the film happens a year later, when everyone just wants, basically, to get Sarah out of the house and back into life, and out of her unrelenting despair. Before they actually enter the cave, we get a feel for the characters and their own reactions to Sarah's tragedy. The awkwardness that permeates everything is always there, as it would be in real life, and Sarah is just trying to make the most of it. The rest of the film can be summed up as Sarah being placed in a situation in which there is seemingly no escape for her or any of her friends as they're killed one after another.The film is pretty keen with its use of gore. None of it is pointless. It's meant to shock, but to shock for a reason. It's well-placed and directly relates to each character in their own reactions. Without the gore, it wouldn't look as natural to see their respective sanities begin to slip. When we ultimately get down to how Sarah handles it, we see the result of everything that's happened since the accident that left her without any family, nearly all her friends dead, and a transformation in her that culminates in the excellent final couple of shots in the UK ending. Now, you won't get that in the US version, which chooses instead to be a pointless horror flick without all that awful depth that the film is designed to have about people in utter despair and desperation.Really, this is such a totally different film from the one we got in US theaters that it becomes a completely different being. Practically everything is different, especially its tone and purpose. The US version was intentionally shallow and designed for cheap thrills. The original wasn't nearly so asinine in its approach, and is definitely worth several watches. There are little details that can be noticed that make it stand out as a truly well-designed character study and horror film in one.Very highly recommended, especially if you haven't seen the original and have only seen the very severely cut US version. It's definitely up high as one of my favorite films of all time for its original portrayal of Sarah and her transformation throughout the film, as well as the interactions between the characters, which is surprisingly convincing, the way people would normally react to such events happening around them. Just excellent.",

    "review/summary": "I won't say much",
    "review/text": "Well I'll try not to say much. This film is one of the highest rated films I've read about in the past year. Rarely have I seen this film get reviewed and not get at least 4 stars. That won't neccessarily be the case with customer reviews, since J.A. Lieder (I think that was the name) thinks the film is really bad. Not that a critics opinion really matters, but in my opinion, if Roger Ebert gives a HORROR film I like (and I liked 'Hostel', although for different reasons than others and I'll be the first to admit it's flaws) 4 stars, then that tells me this film has a certain accessibility. Newer films like \"Hostel\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes\", while enjoyable horror films IMO, are very limited with the kind of audience that will want to watch it more than once, and in some cases even finish it. Everyone that I have met that has seen this movie, even the ones that aren't horror fans, thought it was awesome. A friend of mine who doesn't like gore, and who is going to film school, thought the movie was well written and intense. He even used the term \"Greek Tragedy\" to describe it. That's a first.Any who, tonight I became envious of a friend of mine who I showed this film to. She didn't even hear about this film. All I told her was \"You're coming over to watch my favorite horror film of the year. It's like 'Alien', and as amazing as 'The Thing', in the woods.\" I later said the cast is pretty much all female. In all honesty that shouldn't matter but it really adds that much more to the story considering a specific conflict(s) that occurs in the film. The point being, she had no idea what she was in for. I turned out all the lights, and didn't talk. She loves horror films, and was absolutely frightened. I'm so jealous of that because I've been following the film since it's July 2005 release in the U.K. and missed it by a couple of hours at The Sundance Film Festival, so the surprise factor was somewhat diminished.There are plenty of reviewers who have described the story and why its good, so if you want to learn more about the film I suggest reading earlier reviews. All I will say is, I was so goddamn happy when this film was over because this is the horror film I've been waiting for for years. I just wanted to watch it again and again. Heck my friend who was horrified even admitted she wanted to watch it back to back!One thing no one really mentions when discussing this film is the music score. David Julyan, who has done films for Christopher Nolan like 'Memento' and 'The Prestige', has made quite possible my favorite score this year. Neil Marshall used his work for the remake of 'Insomnia' as a temp-track, and they both have similarities. David crafts a rather unlikely score for a horror film that could work in a serious drama or even at times an epic like 'The Lord of the Rings'. That's not to say it is better but I was very surprised by the way it sounds. The score knows how to let the sound design come through in the film though, which is nice. There are some intense dissonant clashes of noise, and even some rhythmic action-movie styled moments, but there is one song (track 19 or 20 on the soundtrack, I like it so much I own it. I've been listening to it since 'The Descent' left theaters and listening to it has made me so impatient for this dvd release) that affected my emotions. I can't describe the scene, but the music is very diatonic, using mostly (I haven't analyzed completely) just the natural minor scale. The build ups feel so powerful, and there are parts where different instruments will descend scale wise while others ascend, creating an amazing harmony. David knows how to employ the dissonance between certain melodic intervals that really just grabs me. This might sound lame, but I almost cried in this movie because of it. Very melancholic.It just seems like everything about this movie works so well. I'm very surprised that some people think it is bad. Although, there is one actress who at times delivered lines where I thought \"Eh...should have re-shot that,\" but I can forgive it considering everything else about it shows the film industry how you're REALLY supposed to make a horror film.I saw this film twice in one day. The first very early in the afternoon all by myself, where I was frightened, and in the evening with almost a sold out showing, where I haven't heard so much nervous laughter and screaming in my entire life. If you are a horror fan, you owe it to yourself to see this. If you don't like it, eh, what can I say? It's all subjective I guess. If you appreciate cinema this is definitely worth checking out. And one last thing, this was one of the scariest movie watching experiences of my life, but that's just me.",

    "review/summary": "First-rate UK Horror",
    "review/text": "The British horror industry seems to be coming back to life in recent years, and Neil Marshall's sophomore film \"The Descent\" is the latest impressive addition to the growing catalogue. Marshall previously directed the much, perhaps excessively, lauded \"Dog Soldiers\". I thought \"Dog Soldiers\" was good, but not altogether remarkable, and \"The Descent\" is definitely a cut above that, and falls into the upper tier of horror films. Though \"Dog Soldiers\" wasn't quite a horror-comedy it was definitely a relatively lighthearted, fun and humorous horror movie, while \"The Descent\" is much darker and more serious. The setup, as in most horror movies, is exceedingly simple: A group of friends go on a caving expedition only to be assailed by a pack of carnivorous, subhuman monsters. This will doubtless cause many ignorant individuals to suppose that this film is a knockoff of \"The Cave\", but hopefully the superior quality and craftsmanship of the film will carry it during its American release. Either way, horror aficionados will know the score, and that Neil Marshall has clearly established himself as one of the most, probably the most, promising up and coming horror director of the new millennium.Marshall says, in interviews, that his prime inspiration for the film is the early 70's classic \"Deliverance\". This may seems a little strange at first glance, but they have a lot in common under the surface: Both focus on a group of friends who enjoy going on athletic, adventurous vacations only to find that they've now bitten off more than they can chew, facing dangers from both murderous individuals and the natural setting itself. Of course, replacing \"rafting\" and \"crazy rednecks\" with \"caving\" and \"monsters\" is a pretty substantial reworking, but it's not tough to believe that this is where Marshall got his main inspiration. In contrast to the all-male major cast of that film we've got an all female ensemble here. We've got 6 people here, perhaps a few too many to allow for much characterization of a couple of them. (i.e. Sam and Becca) Other then those two we've got Sarah, who is somewhat more timid and low-key then most of the others, partially due to the tragic accident which occurred during their last trip. Then we've got Juno, the one American and the authoritative leader of the group, and her reckless Irish protege Holly plus Sarah's best friend Beth. Again, we don't get to know all of these characters terribly well, since there is little time for characterization prior to their horrific adventure, but they at least aren't the obnoxious cliches you'd find in most horror films, and Marshall manages to create some real pain and sadness in their deaths.Technically the film is very accomplished, particularly for having a mere 6 million dollar budget. The widescreen cinematography is very nice, particularly in the aerial establishing shots, and they manage to keep it from getting to visually monotonous in the cave itself. The cave is a set, naturally, but it looks very good, though the effects do falter at a few points, particularly a CGI bat swarm, and a somewhat dubious cave-in. Acting is professional and convincing all around, though perhaps not that much is asked from some of them. I also really like the score. It's effectively varied, with some throbbing pulses along with roaring, shrieking and chaotic stuff all topped off by the very dramatic main theme.\"The Descent\" uses an interesting, uncommon tactic: The film pretends like you are watching a completely different movie from the one you really are up until the point where things really fall apart. This isn't like in some horror films, where they just kinda sit around for an hour before the killing starts, as we've got an actual plot and conflict here: Shortly after entering the cave the entrance collapses, trapping them all inside a previously unexplored cavern which may or may not have another exit. Thus, they have to deal with a wide variety of concerns prior to the appearance of the monsters, including a gruesome compound fracture where they have to cram the bones back into her leg in order to splint it. There are relatively few hints that anything is actually going on prior to the appearance of the monsters, and I suspect that anyone who watched this completely blind and who wasn't paying a ton of attention may be in for a surprise.Once the crawlers show up things really get out of control, and the film is just this side of incoherent, as the various characters are separated, wandering around looking for each other, hiding, and fighting the crawlers etc. A monster movie needs a good monster to work, and the Crawlers are quite cool. Not truly remarkable or anything, but nasty and gruesome enough to be effective, and their makeup is very good. Needless to say this film is extremely dark, not so much that scenes are poorly lit, but that many portions of the screen are not lit at all, with nothing but flashlights to illuminate it. At a few moments I literally could not tell what the hell was going on the first time I watched it, but these are rare enough that it's not too big of a problem. One minor concern is that the characters are frequently extremely tough to tell apart in the later scenes, but honestly it doesn't really make that much of a difference who is who. Personally, I didn't really find this movie scary, but it is intense and severely watchable, which is just as good. That's another nice thing about the long, buildup, as that it allows Marshall to throw everything at us in the climactic 35 or so minutes, and the film is just unrelenting from the first encounter on.Many have claimed this film is old-fashioned, and while that it true in many ways, that isn't correct regarding the violent encounters, which are exceedingly modern, particularly reminding me of \"28 Days Later\". Here Marshall uses incredibly frantic editing, sometimes makes the movement haphazard and jerky by speeding up the action or cutting frames. This sorta modern presenting it is risky, and many films like this are tiresome and incoherent, but they get it just right here, making it genuinely chaotic but maintaining coherence. I should also mention that the film is fairly gruesome. It doesn't linger on the gore, but there's plenty of spurting blood and flesh eating going on. Furthermore, it's got genuinely brute, painful violence, not the over-the-top and silly bloodletting you'd see in lotsa gory movies.This DVD has restored the UK ending, and I've never felt strongly about it either way. Neither ending is great, but they're both acceptable. Ultimately, I think the US theatrical ending implies what's show in the UK one, so they're effectively identical. As for the DVD itself, I haven't got much of an eye for this kinda thing, but the transfer looks good to me, and the Director/Cast commentary was fairly entertaining, if not overwhelmingly insightful.But all that aside this is just a great horror film. Definitely one of the best ones in recent memory, and mandatory viewing for any horror fan.Grade: A-",

As far as horror movies are concern Directors really do not conduct as good as job as in the other catagories listed above. However, this movie (The descent) is head and shoulders above all the other horror movies in the last past ten to twenty years or since Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee collaboration. Moreover, the plot is about five women that are close friends. They take their girlfriend on a cave exploring journey to cheer her up, because she just lost her husband and son in a car accident. One of the women has a secret that could make this expedition turn really ugly. In addition, the women get trapped and must find a way out after realizing that they are not the only ones in the cave and they do not possess a map of their location. The team has to pull together and fight for their lives against the creatures that can not see, but they do have keen sense of hearing. This movie has very good acting. The flow of the movie is good along with the action and fight scenes. I thought that this movie did very well for not having all of the high paid movie stars of the today's world. You can not go wrong by purchasing or renting this movie. Although when it comes out December 26, 2006, I will definitely add this to my DVD (movie) collection.",

    "review/text": "A tight-knit trio of outdoorsy ladies invite some friends along for a weekend of alcohol and spelunking, but ultimately bite off more than they can chew in an uncharted system of North Carolina caverns. Darkness is an essential ingredient of any good horror flick, and after a chamber collapses shortly into the expedition, there's no shortage of that. The tight quarters add an appreciable element of claustrophobia to the mix, too, which really heightens the tension when a creepy tribe of pale, man-eating creatures appear and begin picking off stragglers. It's a good recipe, with plenty of quality spooks, but the low visibility and lack of characterization for most of the supporting cast meant I was playing guess-the-victim during the hairier scenes. Still, points for proficiency and for testing a few new tricks on a tried-and-true formula.",

    "review/summary": "A movie that explores the dark recesses of the subconscious",
    "review/text": "First off I have to give credit to someone on IMDB (grayden1977) who mentioned the symbolism in this film. Prior to reading that review I found this to be an average movie. But once you realise the importance of metaphors, this turns out to be a great horror story.Basically, this movie explores the dark side of the human psyche - the side that we don't show and find hard to confront. Nonetheless it's the part of us that is roused when we need to conquer our demons and set things right. This movie could be summarised as an allegorical telling of a particularly nasty argument between two friends - one where no punches are pulled and everything is dragged into the open.The film begins with a group of friends who are whitewater rafting. The husband and daughter of one of the women (Sarah) stand nearby watching. On the drive back, Sarah's husband seems distracted by something and ends up crashing the car leaving Sarah as the only survivor.We then skip to a year later. The five friends have planned another trip with Sarah, in part to lift her spirits but also to bring them together again (we find out that certain girls haven't visited her since the accident). The trip is headed up by Juno, a risk-taking, adrenaline junkie who's planned out a caving expedition for them. She continually states that the trip is for Sarah.We soon learn that Juno had been having an affair with Sarah's husband, which may have been why he was distracted on the day of the accident - it is not clear if Sarah is aware of the affair.The day of their trip starts slowly but the pace soon picks up and they're quickly within the cave. It doesn't take long for the girls to get into trouble but it's just the start of their nightmarish ordeal. The cave is a metaphor for Sarah's subconscious, which is still troubled by the death of her family. What happens within the cave is how her morality manifests itself in the physical world.Throughout the movie, the viewer is challenged with claustrophobia-inducing camerawork, an inventive use of colours, light and darkness and a good deal of gore. But the scariest part is being let into the mind of a grieving woman looking for solace who finds something truly horrifying.*** SPOILERS ***I hate to mention spoilers in a review but this stuff is just too good to pass up. Since it is Juno that leads Sarah and the girls into the cave (and ultimately gets them trapped and lost), we can assume that she is the reason Sarah has been forced to confront the death of her family and the possible causes for it.We get plenty of hints that Juno was having an affair with Sarah's husband and this may have been why he was distracted that day. I interpreted Sarah's morality as somewhat twisted by this point (hence the dark cave, collapsed tunnels and strange monsters) and this is why she feels that Juno is responsible for her family's death.Juno was definitely selfish, neglected to bring a map and left one of their friends to die, but she also tried to save Holly from being dragged away. It's interesting that she tries to save Holly without anyone else around but then leaves the other girl (whom she accidentally killed) to die by herself. Later, when Sarah is separated from the group, Juno makes a \"public\" show of \"not leaving without Sarah\".I didn't really like the way the monsters looked but I think they were intentionally humanoid because they represent Sarah's \"demons\"; specifically, they represent Sarah's evil desire to kill Juno.The ending might be seen as cliched, especially since it involves a dream-like sequence, but I think it works in this case and it wasn't a cheap way of tying up loose ends (as is the case in many other movies).",

    "review/summary": "SCARY AS HELL 9.5 OUT OF 10",
    "review/text": "The Descent is one of the best horror movies I've ever watched. It's actually scary, the gore is gut-wrenching, the setting is great, and the creature designs are great. If you love horror movies, you need to watch this movie because it's the best horror movie made in over a decade.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Six women; Sarah, Juno, Beth, Rebecca, Holly, and Sam; go on a cave-climbing trip in the Appalachian Mountains, and find a mysterious cave no one has been in for over a century and wish to claim it and name it... or at least Juno does. The rest of the group thinks they're going to Borham Caverns. Things seem to be going well for a while, until the cave entrance collapses, and now they are trapped two miles underground with grotesque human-like creatures who like the taste of flesh.STORYLINE: SCORE: 8 OUT OF 10- Some parts of the story evoke memories of storylines that would come from a movie in the '80s, or perhaps earlier. However, the story is done well, although the beginning is slow, and it never gives an explanation as to what those creatures are, or an explanation of the bizarre and creepy ending. But that will never really bother you.MUSIC: SCORE: 9 OUT OF 10- There's not much, but it's good, and it knows when the pivotal moments of terror in the film come up.GORE FACTOR: SCORE: 9.75 OUT OF 10- The gore is just plain nasty and nausea-inducing. Eye-squishing, rock-climbing-axe-stabbing, falling into giant pools of blood, broken leg, and people being eaten... lovely.SCARE FACTOR: SCORE: 9.5 OUT OF 10- Don't watch this movie in the dark, it will scare the hell out of you. The film is tense a lot as you fear what comes next, and you don't know what comes next. It's really a marvel to see a film that still has an ability to scare you.ENTERTAINMENT: SCORE: 9.5 OUT OF 10- Aside from a slow beginning, this film has the perfect entertainment for horror fans and will definitely satisfy those who are looking for something that is actually scary and worth watching as a horror movie. Don't watch this movie if you're afraid of the dark or you're claustrophobic because it is loaded with these fears.OVERALL: SCORE: 9.5 OUT OF 10- This film is incredible and rather impressive, as it puts so many other horror movies to shame. You will enjoy it, you will get the crap scared out of you, and you will feel a little sick from the gore... HELL YES!!THE GOOD: It's scary, it's gory, and it's one of the best horror movies made in over a decade.THE BAD: Slow beginning.",

I'm claustrophobic, and I the only air I was gasping for watching this piece of sadistic trash was estrogen free oxygen.Someone mentioned Dario Argento in relation to this movie. Please, no. His misogyny was a little less subtle and easier to take because he never bothered to make characters out of the women he slaughtered on camera. I find it kind of disturbing that people enjoy watching this sort of thing and write rave reviews about it. If all these chicks had died because they went insane and we never got a clear picture of the creatures that would be one thing, but you're telling me you enjoy watching this?The only remotely effective part of this ludicrous mess is the end.

Odd creatures come out (who apparently can't see, and have to rely on their hearing) and attack the women, in different ways. They weren't as scary as people made them out to be. Just typical-looking monsters.A big problem I had with the Descent was that the picture was incredibly dark, because the majority of the movie takes place in a cave, so darkness is mostly all around them, except for the flashlights and whatnot. A very dark film.There were a couple moments that made me jump, such as that scene in the beginning of the film when the woman jumped out of bed and walked to the window. Other than that, the movie was just a typical horror and bloodfest. It would be a good idea to look elsewhere.",

This film details the story of a girls' weekend in the woods, filled with gossip, laughter, and - of course - spelunking. Rebellious Juno learns an important lesson about telling the truth as she leads the girls on their expedition into a breathtakingly expansive cave, and the group of girls are delightfully excited to discover a previously unknown species of cave creature with fiesty personalities. Sarah, the protagonist, teaches us, the viewers, to be brave in the face of adversity, and above all else, to have trust in yourself!",

    "review/text": "I haven't seen a movie like this one in ages. It was bloody, messy and very creepy. The Descent is purely terrifying. It will provide you with an experience that relates entirely to those of the characters on screen. Each one is trapped, isolated and alone. The film, like it's big brother 'Dog Soldiers', takes British horror to it's deserved glory. Unlike such films as 'Creep', which was a complete mess, The Descent is a chilling experience that places believable characters into a situation that is strangely real, despite the obvious fiction.Films with great gore abound, for example Jason X, with the audience just waiting for the next gruesome killing to end the tedium in between. However, The Descent keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout, struggling for breath as you feel the walls closing in. This is a film to watch in a very dark room with great surround sound. This is a must watch film for those who complain that horror films just aren't scary anymore. Just make sure that whoever you take with you is prepared for the experience. Word of mouth is sure to make this film a success.",

    "review/text": "Somewhat resembling a big budget `Blair Witch Project' for adults, `The Descent' finds six girlfriends from the U.K. spelunking in the caves of Appalachia after one of them, Sarah (Shaina McDonald), has a tragic family SUV accident. Wanting to console her a year after she loses her husband, Sarah is not always a happy camper. Everyone is all smiles in their mountain cabin, but soon we are confronted by the usual surprise tactics: people sneaking up on others, bats coming out of nowhere, etc. The movie then digs deep into the subconscious. There are dream sequences that effectively tap our deeper regions. Then, we go down physically. (How refreshing it is to have a horror movie where going down and tunneling through caves replaces the forest or haunted buildings. )In the movie, writer and director, Neil Marshall, relies on plausible missteps. There's the misplaced and left behind guide books, replaced in favor of adventure, and then there are injuries. Tunneling through the caverns and tight holes made me feel claustrophobic, so true was the journey's authenticity. (And I don't suffer from claustrophobia.) There's also a foreboding presence that is made tangible with low-key creepy music. In the story there is also some ambiguity about treachery that thickens the plot. Led by Juno (Natalie Mendoza) but having Rebecca (Sashia Mulder) as a key player adds to our drama and makes the dangers lurking ahead all the more dire...The line, \"We all lost something in that crash,\" creates a tension and a needed ambiguity. Twisty, just like the underground terrain, `The Descent' rises above most formula horror pictures, even, if like M. Night Shymalan's, `Signs,' and many others, it relies a great deal on anticipation to create its results.",

    "review/text": "Besides the ending, which leaves you scratching your head, The Descent was excellent. The vague ending didnt bother me that much. It lets you end it the way you want to in your own mind. Did that really happen the way I seen it? What exactly happened? What was real and what was in that persons head? It ended in a way that leads to talk after the film on what YOU think happened. And I like that.What this movie does extremely well is the fear of tight spaces. I am not claustrophobic AT ALL but this film had me freaked out even before all heck broke loose. The girls fit thru tight shafts about 18 inches square, some filled with water. Gasping for air, the roof falling in on them. It had me on edge just from that. Another plus for the movie what that \"the crawlers\" did not show up until about 45-50 minutes in. Up to that point all you had to be afraid of was the girls getting trapt underground. It was as if the film maker wanted to lull you into thinking nothing was lurking in the shadows. Then BAM, over half way thru the movie \"the crawlers\" pop out and the whole mood changes.These nasty buggers have no sight, pale white skin and sharp hearing. They never see the light of day. They have been living in these caves for hundreds of years. Were they once human? I think so. And living in the darkness for centuries they lost sight, gained hearing and lost the ability to speak. These guys are gross. The way they move sends chills. They creap around and you never know when they will pop out.I suggest you pop The Descent in for friends and dont tell anyone what the plot of the movie is. Nearly an hour will go by without anyone guessing what the movie is really about. It will shock everyone I promise you! AWESOME!!!!",

    "review/text": "Sometimes I think when people watch a horror film these days they expect a little too much the reality is there is very little new that a director can bring to the horror genre. A few years ago the English speaking world was treated to the Ring and suddenly went crazy for Japanese films due to the whole 'more suspense less gore' aspect of the films. Along came Grudge then along came Dark Water which (to steal the title of another film) was frankly ahem..a 'bridge too far' People made a big thing about Saw but to be honest for all the pseudo intelligent nut case it was all done before in Seven (elaborate methods of murder to punish and teach the victim a lesson etc) The point is, this film should come as no surprise when you find it has little to offer.You can find almost the exact same format from the Hills Have Eyes down to Creep. Group of normal folk go on holiday only to be killed off by lunatics, hillbillies, mutants, inbreds etc....That the film has an all female leading cast really had little effect on me (I guess with it being underground and in near darkness there wasn't any sexual aspect to it) and really I just didn't see any 'feminist' slant to the film nor did I see the monsters in this film as 'males' (Maybe there was some subliminal feminist motive to the film that was just lost on me)The film has all that is needed for a good night in watching a shock/horror/gore film. Group of people hopelessly lost in tunnels and caves being picked off by blind monstrous looking things which do look like the character in the film Creep. The body count mounts on both sides as the ladies use whatever weapons come to hand to fend off their attackers (to some good effect) so you will be treated to plenty of blood, plenty of cracked skulls, fair bit of eye gouging, a dash of entrails eating and a fair bit of blood squirts from gaping head wounds.Is this predicable? Yes. If you are looking for a horror film to make you think as well as scare you best look somewhere else. If you want a good hour and a half of shock, blood and scare then this may be the film for you.",

Shocking, scary, thrilling and so fantastic it can chill you to the very bone, \"The Descent\" is a free-fall into fear that simply cannot be missed.Not since James Cameron burst onto the scene with \"The Terminator\" has a director crafted as deliriously kinetic a calling card as writer/director Neil Marshall does with his new horrific subterranean adventure \"The Descent.\" Following up his 2002 giddy soldier vs. werewolf movie \"Dog Soldiers,\" the filmmaker has created one of the most deliciously terrifying adventures as any I've seen in years. This is a beautiful movie, a sublimely eerie meditation on why we're all afraid of the dark and an examination of why the deepest fears aren't the ones attacking from the outside, but the ones gurgling up from within.",

Most movies of this type lose their ability to scare (me, anyway) by the second viewing. Not \"The Descent.\" Feelings of claustrophobia, panic, disorientation and dread cropped up even when I watched this movie a third time.This is a combination adventure/monster movie. It's got all the physical action of an Indiana Jones flick (only played out by six women!), mixed with the gory shocks of the original Alien. Seemingly against the odds, director Neil Marshall succeeds beyond my wildest expectations. I cared about the characters, I was sickened, I was disturbed. What more can you ask from a movie about cavers going up against man-eating bat creatures?The cast is uniformly excellent. Marshall's direction is brilliant. The sets are completely convincing. The scares are well placed and effective. I never thought I'd say this, but I loved both endings. The cinematography and music are first-rate.What sticks in my mind most of all is the first encounter with the Crawlers. I won't give it away, but the reveal of the cannibal in the bone room is, quite simply, the most effective shock I've ever seen in a movie. Marshall places it at just the right moment, so that you never quite know when to expect it ... and then BANG! Who the hell is THAT guy?!?Great movie.",

But let me begin by saying what a joyous thrill it was to finally watch a modern horror film that mangaged to be scary, suspenseful, disturbing and genuinely creepy. What an experience it was to see these women battle something so heinus, so imaginatively disturbing, so humanly wrong that my jaw was sore from holding my mouth open for 90 minutes. Don't waste your time thinking you'll know what is going to play out in this film because you will be dead wrong. The films disturbingly wondrous discoveries are part of its powerful impact. And that's all I'll say about the great qualities this movie posesses.I enjoy the opportunity to \"remake\" a movie as to how I think it should have been made. So, let me start by saying that the beginning needs to go. Movies need to land on their feet running, and to have us sludge through back story and needless character development is a waste of precious film time. The movie should have started from the moment they decend into the cave. A few hints and commments about their life stories and why they are all together could have been done during the cave exploration scenes. Nevermind the overused explanation as to why they were on this trip to begin with (the tragic death of a loved one prompts the characters to go on a retreat to recouperate and deal with their grief). It simply doesn't matter. I also felt that there were too many characters. I say this only because it grew rather confusing to keep track of who was who when certain characters were in peril. Throw in the darkness of the cave and it was even more confusing to identify who the victims were. Finally, I have to mention the AWFUL ending. I won't reveal it but I will just say it deflates the incredible adrenline rush that the brilliant last hour of the film provides.",

    "review/text": "This movie reminded me a lot of \"Wolf Creek\" It starts very conventional and boring in the beginning (aside from the death in the beginning) but then starts building up adrenaline as it progress. This film is far, far better (and has more surprises) than some of the lackluster flicks like \"Hills Have Eyes\", and \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning\". The man who directed it Neil Marshall hasn't directed a film in three years prior to this but, he showed no rust here.One thing that does stand out this flick from the other garbage (When A Stranger Calls another trash flick) is the fact that this is an all female cast. Think about that for a sec, there haven't been that many horror flicks with all female cast, well at least ones that haven't been this good.Reading some of Neil Marshall's interview on the film and his directing is also interesting. While he had planned to make the movie after \"Dog Soldiers\", nothing really happened. That might actually have been a good thing because he describes working through several drafts of the movie. Having gone through so many, it's conceivable that the first draft may not have been developed as the product fans have seen.The great thing about this movie that sets apart the other garbage released this year is the fact that the characters in the movie are all sympathetic and well rounded. We give a crap about them. That's a key thing that many directors even the big ones miss many times.Shauna MacDonald and Natalie Mendoza who plays Sarah and Juno are absolute fantastic. Natalie has acted in tv shows and movies, but this probably her leading role to date and she really carries this flick along with her co-stars. The story about the girls on a caving expedition is very simple, but once you see the terror that they deal with, both the creatures and terrain they are on, you see it's a very complicated script.As far as the endings for the flick, well I don't see them as a big deal. I figured out how things were going to turn after the accidental death of one of the girls. I wasn't disappointed at all in this flick. It has great acting, action, suspense and for a movie that had such a small budget , Neil really did a fantastic job.Anyhow, glad I finally saw it and I would recommend to others who still haven't seen it.",

This film has been hyped up by critics of all people as one of the scariest films in the past years and that to me says a lot. I've been so disappointed lately with the slump in genuine horror films that I had all but given up in really finding a worthy scare...that was until I heard about 'The Descent'. Granted, there have been horror films of late that have proven to be watchable, to be intense and at times, yes even a little scary, but nothing that had my skin crawling. I wanted to feel trapped, helpless and alone. I can honestly say that throughout the majority of this film that is how I felt, even though the theater was packed and my brother was sitting right next to me.'The Descent' centers on a group of women who enjoy pushing themselves to the limit. The movie opens with three of them, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), Beth (Alex Reid) and Juno (Natalie Mendoza) rafting down some rapids while Sarah's husband and daughter watch in amazement. These girls are fearless...until tragedy strikes in the form of a freak accident that takes the life of Sarah's family. A year later the three girls meet again for their yearly adventure, this time in the Appellation Mountains for some caving. They meet up with three other girls, sisters Sam (MyAnna Buring) and Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and new addition Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), all of whom we have a few minutes to get to know, and then they're off. Juno is the leader of the group, she called the group together for their adventure and she serves as their guide. The only problem is she's not much of a guide being that she doesn't know the cave's they enter.Soon after entering these unknown, uncharted and undiscovered caves the girls become trapped when their point of entry caves in. Without a map these girls have to find their way out, find another exit by burrowing deeper into the cave. This fills the viewer with a sense of claustrophobia that doesn't go away until the credits role. The monsters haven't even shown up and you're already on edge. Everything around these girls is foreign to them, is a potential danger. They are forced to push themselves as far as they can go, to the point of wanting to give up for everything looks helpless. The viewer is also forced to feel this way. I had what I wanted. I felt trapped as they did, I felt helpless as they did, and once the creatures show up, and in a rush of panic the girls separate...I felt alone as they did.From the moment the crawlers show up the movie takes a frantic turn from increasingly creepy and atmospheric to intense and horrific as these girls fight to survive, let alone escape. As intentions are revealed between the girls it also makes things all the more horrifying for you don't know who to trust. If you can't trust anyone then you truly are alone. The pace doesn't let up once the creatures are on the screen, and your heart won't stop racing either. As some of the critics have pointed out, this is a truly horrific film with images that won't leave you anytime soon, and yes, while I was able to sleep alright and didn't toss and turn in fear I was haunted by what I saw. This is not a film for the squeamish, that's a fact not an opinion. Neil Marshall did a brilliant job directing this film, giving it the raw edge that true horror films need, giving it not only jump scenes with blood and gore but building a layer, a foundation of fear before the first drop of blood is shed. And the actresses need to be commended for proving to be believable as well as likable, never 'over-acting' but giving us the feel that this is really happening and that these women are really that petrified (as I'm sure even the manliest of men would be in that given situation). Amazing job all the way around without much of a single drawback.I do say 'without much' and I only say that because of the ending. Now I've seen the US version so I can't speak for the UK version that has a different ending I hear. The US ending, while not horrible, leaves you wondering what is really going on. I have my ideas, that of which I won't share so as not to spoil anything, but I will say that it reminded me a bit of the way I felt after watching 'The Ring'. The only drawback to that film was that the ending didn't answer any of our questions, it just added to the confusion. I felt that way after watching 'The Descent'...confused...but it's not really enough to harp on. The movie does enough redeeming work BEFORE the ending that it's easily forgiven.",

    "review/text": "****NEW ADDED INFORMATION*** I have found out some new information about this film that could change my rating to a better one. This movie had two different endings. The version I saw on cable TV ends with one girl injuring one of her friends and then leaving her in the cave to be eaten alive while she escapes. When she gets to her car to leave she sees the friend in her car sitting next to her(like a haunting memory of what she did to her) I did not like this ending at all as it has been done a ba-zillion times before. I would like to know the other ending if anyone would care to explain. END OF ADDED INFO****The biggest problem with this film is lack of true character development. Having a woman lose her family in a car accident does not create a 3 dimensional character. Typical sub-plot about one friend fooling around with another's husband...blah..blah..blah. From the time this movie begins until they reach the cave is an excruciating example of bad character development. I didn't care about any of these people and when you don't care about the characters, the movie is in trouble.On the plus side, this movie has some creepy moments and it is extremely claustrophobic, but it's has some of the stupidest situations I've seen in any film. Do people actually do these crazy things? Why anyone would want to crawl into a small dark hole the size of a basketball in the middle of nowhere is beyond me! Once these characters put themselves into this predicament, I just couldn't wait for them to die! The creatures are very creepy and when they are on screen, it's quite tense, but it's too easy to make the audience jump in this dark setting, so I can't award too many points for those types of scares. Stupid people go to stupid place and die horrible deaths! I give it 2 1/2 stars. This film could have earned a 4 star rating with a few small changes. It's not unwatch-able, but it not all that good...unless you like pretending your buried alive!",

    "review/text": "Or, \"Geez, is that what they mean by Post Partum Depression?'Neil marshall's spelunk-a-dunk with she-hunks gone terribly wrong has been favorably compared to Aliens, and in one sense it's easy to fathom why: you've got a strong female protagonist (actually, um, all the cavers are chicks, but onward), pitted in a deep, dark, confined space against a shadowy, hungry, and unrelenting Evil.That's about where the similarities end, aside from the hopes of the guys in Marketing---who evidently did their groundwork well & hit the beaches hard for Neil Marshall's follow-up to the blearily gory good-times slaughterfest \"Dog Soldiers\".Don't believe the Hype. Unless you're easily scared, \"Descent\" just isn't that big of a deal: basically a bunch of chicks go spelunking in a Big Deep Cave in the mountains of Appalachia, and have a great time getting in touch with their inner caving-chick until some flesh-eating troglodytes come along and start harshing the vibe.But let's back up a bit: Descent's reluctant heroine Sarah (Shauna MacDonald, who does what she has to do with reserve & a stiff upper lip) has had a nasty trauma: her husband and daughter were killed in what is possibly the coollest road accident I've ever seen translated to film, minutes after her group's last escapade: a white-water rafting expedition in Scotland, where she thought---glimpsed, a few scant, fleeting moments of sight enhanced by a woman's intuition---that something just might be going on between her husband and the group's Alpha Female, Juno (deliciously played by Natalie Jackson Mendosa, who can sink her pitons in my futon any time).Six months pass, and Sarah has to get back up on the horse, get back on that stallion girl, head back into the wilds with her former gang. She agrees to go caving with Juno & her caving buds, but none of the women fully grasp the enormity of the challenge against which Juno has pitted the team.They're about to find out.Now look: long before Mark Twain penned that nasty, creepy, claustrophobic chase sequences between Injun Joe & Tom & Becky in the caverns, good solid folks---folks like you, Gentle Reader!---have had a horror, a fair dose of squeam, when it comes to thinking about being trapped beneath the ground, caught, stuck, air running out, darkness flowing down over your face, your mouth, like a mask, a caul, a coffin.Brrrr.Marshall is a fine director when it comes to building up atmosphere, and just as he did in \"Dog Soldiers\", he builds it here in brilliant little snippets: an ancient climber's piton gouged into the rock, a mouldering miner's helmet left orphaned in the inky black, the chittering and chirruping of something well off in the Dark---just beyond the pass, the turn, the little shaft that curves off to the northeast.I was hooked until the first attack, until the first big creature reveal, and here Marshall falls on his own sword: he's great at building suspense, but lousy at delivering the goods. The cave-troglodytes, however awful---and they're awful, particularly the den-mother who comes sloshing across this swimming-hole of goop & blood and viscera to throttle Sarah---never can compare with what you imagine might be stalking these women, just out of eyeshot, nestled back in the inky black.Worse, once the big attack comes, it's clumsily shot & edited---lessening the tension, rather than ratcheting it up.Step back from the film a second, please: think about the vast, horrible, gigglingly-insanely scary potential of a group of women marooned in an unexplored cave-system, their retreat blocked, the way forward mined and menaced at every turn. Imagine how easy it would be to turn claustrophobia into terror with the tiniest of things: the shift of sand a few feet behind the group, the clatter of talons on an escarpment above---or below; a wilding chase miles below ground, where the Killer takes its time in killing its victim.And the darkest terror of all: don't these things need new flesh, new blood, to breed?I'm not saying you should avoid \"The Descent\". Not at all: in time, it might be one of my 'regrets'; those films I loathed at first, perhaps out of mood, and then came to relish (like I did, originally, with Marshall's \"Dog Soldiers\").But perhaps not: there is something missing here, some jubiliant, nasty, wicked horror frisson that I just didn't feel, that made \"The Descent\" more of a chore and far less than a pleasure.But view it another way and it does get interesting: what if Sarah suspected Juno of stealing her man from her, and made up her mind to seek revenge in those dark, unguessable depths.Now *that* would be a Descent---oh yes, indeed.JSG",

This movie was decent, not great, not excellent.... decent. It was slightly predictable, but there were many times you caught yourself jumping or reacting to a certain part.

Lame. The director also made everything move way too fast during the action scenes and since the camera was right on top of it and it was terrible lighting, half the time you couldn't tell what was going on. He should definitely explored the \"ancient explorers\" aspect of it to give it some interesting depth because the \"dynamic\" of the women's interactions was of no interest at all, half the time I couldn't even tell who was who.

I hope this is not your introduction to the new horror genre because high tension, them, may, and inside are all far superior than this film (French horror is awesome). The movie spent alot of time setting up for the scenes in the cave and had some pointless story before they finally even got to the cave. It seemed like for over half the movie you are sitting there waiting for something to happen. It was so dull, luckilly I had my computer and was surfing the net. I also feel that creatures themselves looked like a knock-off of a sci-fi channel movie. They look like a combination of nosferatu with pirranha teeth. If you see the movie for hot girls you may be happy, but don't expect much to get you to excited....i.e. no nudity.(A cardinal sin if hot girls are in horror movies) There were some scenes in the cave that were quite intense, but not enough. They should have had more scenes concerning the isolation and darkness of the large cave. They also should have created more suspense playing with the emotions of the audience. All the characters seemed to have light moving in the cave through the whole movie, and I believe that if some scenes in complete darkness would have been far more effective. Overall I feel this is no better than any of those straight to video horror movie.",

    "review/text": "Every year studios spew out a multitude of boring, uninspired, and idiotic horror movies on the masses. And every year a few diamonds are found among all that rubble and trash. THE DESCENT is one of those diamonds. An tragic tale of an innocent cavejumping expedition gone wrong. So what's to love about this flick?Well I enjoyed the story. There were so many elements. The cave dwellers are just a small part of a bigger tapestry. The characters are well written. I loved that the women featured in this film were experienced athletes. No bimbos tripping over high heels here. I was blown away by the big reveal as to why they are in that cave in the first place. Yeah, there's blood and guts here and there but it's the psychological stuff that really hits home. I was more terrified of Sarah getting stuck in a crawlspace than a cave ghoul leaping from the ceiling. Not as gory as advertised but what is shown should satisfy slasher fans. And it's not just the monsters dealing the pain either.My only concern is that THE DESCENT may not translate as well to DVD. The theater experience was incredible so I figure if you don't have one of those super-duper home systems then just shut off all the lights and light sources and hopefully that will be just as good. This is one of the best horror movies to come out in a long time. It's got action, drama, murder, gore, tension, humor, and carniverous cave-beasts. Like I said---new classic. Enjoy!",

This movie is phenomenal.For years I slovenly sagged by head after viewing one dissappointing horror flick after another. Jeez what a sad journey, but now I am happy and oh so pleased to tell you my amazon friends, a new king (or queen shall I say) is born for horror.The Descent transends the murky and abysmal, then turns it into a ride that cannot be ignored. Horror fans must see this movie. It is genuinely intense and at times, downright frightening.I don't want to delve into the story. There are far too many people ready and willing to give exhaustive descriptions of the plot. I can do it in one sentence, then I shall tell you of my personal experience.Seven women go off on an expedition into the earth, then almost immediately, the spiral into hopeless, claustrophobic darkness ensues. Oh yes, then there are the creatures...People were screaming, jumping, gasping and running out of the theater. Two girls on the top row had panic attacks, and that was before the movie was half over. I personally was sucked in. Usually I am able to keep a safe distance from the films I watch, so that I can relate to others whether or not the movie is \"good\". I couldn't help it. It teased, pulled then ultimately drew me in. Can any better compliment be given to a movie?The Descent is what every good scary film hopes to be, but seldom reaches. It's fantastic and truly scary. The Queen is dead - long live the Queen._____(Update - Jan 10th, 2006)I have now seen the Descent four times. I'll have to admit that I was always left wanting more with the ending. I thought it was a cheep conclusion to a masterpiece. The R-Rated version, I now know, is to blame for this. Thankfully, now there is the unrated version! It has an elongated ending that is a better match for the film. Now the movie is flawless. ~SAOS~",

    "review/text": "I watched this movie twice then decided not to include it in my vast horror collection.Why? I can't get past the ending (even more so when you immediately watch part two).And a lot of the 'scares' seem less impressive the second time around. Cliches abound with not one but two sudden bursts of animals out of nowhere (birds and bats), the often used BOO factor of someone or something popping out at you when you least expect it, running around screaming when you know something is after you and it tracks you by sound. All of the fear involved is based on a primal inherent dislike/distrust of the darkness, couple that with the fear of falling, being trapped; it's all pretty basic, no great risks in story telling was involved...horror by the numbers.Yes, it's effective, yes, it makes you jump (often), yes it's well done when you consider everything it takes to get you to believe they're in a real cave being picked off by things happy to have their meal catered for once. However, the second time through was a bit of a letdown, because when you know what's going to happen you start to look at other things and start thinking, wait a minute, that didn't make any sense. Too much wondering, too many whys later, I wasn't as impressed as I was originally.It did keep me entertained both times, so that counts for something. Just not a keeper.",

    "review/text": "I'm gonna be the Simon Cowell judge of this film.A FIRST.First film with only girls (except for an early husband scene)! Opposite \"The Thing.\" Promising so far.Skipping to the beginning, about 30 minutes in: (some time after what may be any film's most coincidential yet most stereotypical car accident):SHOCKSIn the cave, at least twice you could see the \"shock\" coming. This makes me think the writer is lazy. Example: A girl and you thinks something is there; it's a false call. Then you can see from 10 miles away when the shock is, unless you are 12 years old and never seen a horror film. I suspect this technique - the red shark - began in jaws. That's how long it's been reused. Then it worked. Everybody now knows it doesn't work anymore, yet they all keep doing it..To have a surprise, you need a new configuration (there are many via conscious thought, none are used in any film).SCARESI was genuinely scared twice - no thrice - in the movie.1): Once near the beginning when the first scary thing happened underground. That was genuinely unnerving, and, most importabntly, we could all relate so well to that because it could be real.2) The first appearance of you don't know what.3) And near the end, after the critter bits ... oh I can't say it, for giving it away. Except that was tremendous, the way she expressed herself.So, after the film was nearly over, it surprised me. There were other times I was nearly scared, or partly. This just confirms to me cliches and stupid rules were fell back upon too much in the main film.EDITING:The rest was a monster mish mash confounded more by the ever-increasingly infuriating idiotic editors today who seem to think it's better in the action scenes if you cannot figure out what the hell is going on to who faster than ever before. Older movies used to have a similar style to disguise the inept monster - quick cuts or moving the camera jerkily. But what a worse cut up mess they make today, when they could make the most flowing continuous actions scenes ever.In this film, the editor was one of the erratic monsters.When will they learn to hold back, and NOT move the camera, or cut, when the scene movement does it all?SOUND:Uh-oh, the aliens have that same, too familiar, clickety clack sound. Christ, thats a bad Siqns.Why in Mell's name?THE DEMONS OF DARKNESSI can't believe there wasn't a point where all was pitch black, or at least for one character (even better) to enable losing their headlight realistic. Imagine that, for a few minutes, preferably half an hour, stretching it and offering something never done before. A totally dark cinema. Hell, that's almost liker Sensurround in Earthquake! An event.One other promising part was the guide telling the ladies, on the way to the cave, that underground you can have delusions, disorientation, and a host of other demons. Neil barely exploited this, yet surely was the core for most intense situations and horror. Each one could have been explored and exploited for maximum variety. But instead all we are left with is what I feel is an above-par by-the-numbers \"ghost cave.\" Toward the end, too often the fright relied on by the monsters appearing, and chomping down on people, and again, and again.The DELUSION aspect could have really been milked, so that for a long time none of them know if they are seeing things - and neither the audience - and that leads to some girls fearing they may be going crazy. But delusion is barely skipped upon.The psychological aspects are where terror is.DISORIENTATION in the dark could have been another new area of horror to explore.Panic-inducing CLAUSTROPHOPIA.was missed too.CHARACTER:Dog Soldiers, Neil Marshall's first film, was on TV for the first time, 2 days after I finally hired The Descent. It confirmed to me - besides the reality of coincidence, yet again - my memory was correct, of the muck-about-humour and surprise witty banter in generous serves, and is how people act in real life. It was the film's best point and made it stand out above all others. The Descent was below this, mostly. Some characters gradually moved toward movie stereotypes (uo-oh, not that dreaded word again), instead of real people that keeps it believable.Has anyone noticed most films mistakenly leave out life-like humour? Or fun?DOG SOLDIERS was all better. I have no complaints about it but mostly praise for its surprises. Except one death scene, in the truck, mimicked Aliens. Likedumb, in the Descent, near the end, a girl almost became Arnold Schwarzzennegger in Predator's climax.So that's one part Aliens, one part Predator. Ha ha. I'll be looking out for a classic Terminator bit in his next film. Ha.THE END:Neil Marshall has taken a descent, instead of ascent, from his first film. Though marginally. That's how the horror begins.Now, I will stop being Simon Cowell, and cower in my cave.",

Although we don't learn a lot about most of the women, save for Sarah and Juno, we learn enough to feel the added suspense while they are in the caves.Before there is even a glimpse of one of the creatures, there are scenes that had me terrified. I'm not especially claustrophobic, but I was very uncomfortable watching as the explorers squeezed their way through very tight spaces. I found myself gripping the edges of my chair during one scene when two women become stuck.Once the creatures make their entrance, the suspense and terror are elevated. The somewhat strained relations between the women become more so. As they begin to trust each other less and less, the creatures become more prominent and the blood bath ensues. There are more than a few \"jump out and scare ya\" moments that are very well done. And through it all, the intense level of suspense never relents.A superior horror film that is definitely not for everyone. Anyone squeamish around tight spaces, intense terror, and gore may not like it. But for those of us who enjoy it, this movie is a gift.",

    "review/text": "** SPOILERS AHEAD! **It's all about motherhood.In the beginning Sarah's husband and daughter are killed in an accident. It is this event leaving Sarah damaged and traumatized that forms the basis of the entire film. A year later Juno organizes a spelunking adventure for Sarah and her friends to help cheer her up. This turns out to be a terrible idea.Now note the scene where the women rappel down into the cave. The cave entrance is a reminder of a birth canal, while the women with their umbilical cord-like ropes extending from their waists are a reminder of babies. It's the birth process only in reverse. Sarah lost her child, is haunted by it to the point of near mental illness, and is now going back to where children are born, back to where her daughter came from. As the red flares transform the rocks and stones into flesh and blood, the cave becomes a \"womb.\"So now all the elements of the film come together. Sarah lost in the \"womb\" battling her emotional demons which are paralleled in the real world by the crawlers. Once she is under attack she naturally goes into survival mode, but this is not just a fight for her life but a fight for her sanity as well.As the film progresses, Sarah is pushed further and further to the brink of madness leading to her cruel revenge on Juno who had been having an affair with her husband. Note here how Sarah herself covered in blood and guts resembles a newborn, for she is no longer the civilized woman she had once been. After this we come to the film's climactic moments where it all makes sense.Sarah runs off, falls and gets knocked unconscious. In the dream sequence that follows, she awakens to a light and climbs out of a second \"birth canal\" comprised of bones and skulls. It is here we witness the death of the sane Sarah and the birth of the INSANE Sarah.It is only in this state that she can find an end to her torment and experience true happiness. Sarah has stopped fighting. She has her daughter back, and she is at peace. In the film's final moments, we hear the cries of the crawlers echoing the psychosis of her mental collapse as we see her blissfully trapped in the cave forever... The \"womb\" has become the tomb. The End.The Descent is not just a great horror film, it's a great film period. / RATING: Excellent!",

    "review/text": "** This review contains spoilers. **Sarah's husband and child died in a tragic car accident a year ago. Now, her estranged friends come together with her to go on their annual caving trip. It's a little awkward at first because they hadn't seen each other since the accident, but that's quickly over as they spend a night of drinking and reminiscing together. The next day, they head out to Borum Caverns, an easy, tourist level cave. They go there to find a much more difficult cave and end up trapped inside due to an avalanche. They start to panic and turn on each other. One of them becomes injured because of her own recklessness, making it imperative that they get to the surface. An unforeseen obstacle rears its ugly head in subterranean humanoid creatures that attack with ferocity and hunger. Can these six women battle these dangerous creatures and make it to the surface alive?I saw posters for The Descent during its theatrical run in the US and I dismissed it as another cheesy, lame horror film. A few years later, my sister recommended it to me and I watched it in total darkness, enhancing the scares and the film's already creepy atmosphere. The Descent is a frightening and claustrophobic film that features both realistic and supernatural scares. The first half of the film has no supernatural elements at all. The scares stem from narrowly escaping being crushed in an avalanche and trying to find a way out of the undiscovered cave while trying to keep calm despite practically certain death. Then the cannibalistic cave dwelling creatures appear and all hell breaks loose. The six women struggle to fight off these monsters and find a way out as their numbers dwindle, making their true natures emerge.The six women in this film each have their own strong personalities and back stories that are established when they meet at a cabin the night before. When they are put under the stress of being trapped, they turn on Juno, the woman responsible for misleading the group and dooming them to certain death. Despite their fear and hopelessness, these women are incredibly resourceful and strong, even in the face of monsters. The monsters cause some of them to lose their humanity in order to fight back as ferociously and survive, Sarah and Juno in particular. Sarah goes from emotionally crippled and barely functional to bad ass creature killer. She puts aside her fear and emotion until only her anger remains. Juno is the opposite. She starts out strong until she accidentally murders one of her friends in the heat of battle. Afterwards, she keeps physically strong, but her fear and guilt eat at her. Sarah stabs Juno in the leg and leaves her for dead surrounded by creatures as revenge for everything that happened. Is it Sarah who has turned into a morally devoid monster and killed her friend? Or is Juno the villain, whose carelessness and cockiness cost her friends their lives? There is no clear answer to who is more justified or who ultimately is the hero of the film.The Descent is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. It's a perfect mix of suspense and gore that works harmoniously in a way I haven't seen before. Through the supernatural aspect, it shows how quickly the behaviors and constructs of civilization fall away to basic, animalistic survival instincts. The women that make up the entire cast are well written and wonderfully crafted, dynamic characters. I highly recommend this film, but urge you to watch the UK ending and ignore the US ending.",

    "review/text": "Written and directed by Neil Marshall, who also happened to write and direct one of my personal favoritesDog Soldiers, knocked out another instant classic with this film. Highly underrated on it's release the more people were able to see it though were able to help spread the word into a horror film I don't know anyone who has disliked.The movie starts with a tragic accident and shows how six good friends come together to enjoy one of their favorite past times as both a way to have fun as well as a way to help the one involved in the accident get back on her feet and move on with her life. How does one turn a movie about six tough female spelunkers of all things into a horror movie? What exactly is a spelunker? Watching The Descent will easily answer that as it was hands down one of the best horror films in the past 10 years! Oh, and to answer the second question a spelunker is a cave explorer for those who really didn't know.There are many ways to up the suspense level in a situation where 6 people are exploring caves. In fact how many basic premises of fear can we fit in? The three major ones are: the dark, being lost, claustrophobia and building on all three with a slew of increased dangers and ideas. How about starting the exploring and realizing the person in charge of setting up the expedition thought it would be a great idea to instead of picking a known cave system to explore a brand new one? Now let's mix in that they initially started to follow a map that wasn't relevant to the cave they were in and no one has a clue on which cave they actually went to explore?Of course known for his first film about werewolves it's easy to think he may include a creature of some sort chasing after our explorers - and he does. So on top of the above 3 major reasons for suspense to build upon, once things almost look like they are going well we can add in something stalking them into the mix. It is quickly clear what these creatures are what is hard to figure out is how these 6 friends will be able to avoid them and get out alive.When I first heard the premise for this film I wasn't sold on the idea that it was going to be great. When someone told me it was \"kind of like Dog Soldiers but with women in a cave\" I was worried it was just a rehash of a basic premise. In fact I wasn't even really interested in seeing the film until one of my friends said I was doing a disservice to myself for not giving it a chance and reminded me of my dislike for most werewolf films and how much I liked Neil's first movie about werewolves. Don't let this gem of the horror genre pass you by if you aren't sure if the plot was going to hold your attention - it will.",

Probably not. Still, it was quite interesting for what it was. Kinda like the 'Poseidon' of the caves, wandering through unnavigated areas trying to find a way out, and tragedies occuring frequently along the way.The monsters got a bit much though. Creamy yellow slimy monsters which scream at and eat people. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all. They all look like Golum from 'Lord Of The Rings' still.At least the movie wasn't an American blockbuster, it was English. That's something. And you kinda get to know the characters, understanding their personalities in every scene, learning their names and not forgetting them, remembering when someone has died.My favourite characters were Holly and Juno. Holly was funny and knew how to have a laugh. She annoyed everyone else but she was probably the funnest of them all. No-one really liked Juno but she meant well. I think she would have tried her best for her friends and wouldn't purposely try to hurt them, still, she was the hated one in the end.The scariest part is when the real life realities are shown. How when we rot away (or in this case flesh eaten by raging mad monsters) all that we are, are bones underneath, and how death can happen so easily. It's frightening how each and every one of us are so robot like, we're machines, humans with minds, feelings, thoughts and emotions, but our bodies are totally separate from that; one false move and we're gone, nothing can change that. No happy endings make me happy though, that's for sure :)Decent enough movie though, worth seeing. 3 stars.",

None of the underground scenery was real, but you would never know it, unless you are an avid spelunker, and I would like to hear from you if you are to see if the set was as realistic as it looked.DO NOT watch this movie if you think it is an adaptation of the book by Jeff Long. I will admit, there ARE similarities between the two - albeit meager ones.The unrated version includes a final minute of footage that is cut from other versions. Yes, one minute can change everything.",

    "review/summary": "A gripping, claustrophobic film",
    "review/text": "I don't know why some people hate this film. I have read the bad reviews, and tried to sympathize, but I can't. It's got a somewhat slow beginning, but you can't always just jump into the action, and keep it up.The \"descent\" is figurative, as well as literal. The lead character, traumatized over the death of her husband and daughter in a vehicle accident, is having a hard time trying to cope with and process what happened to her. In time, she and her friends embark on a caving trip, and the one leading the trip, named \"Juno,\" decided to surprise the rest of them by going to an uncharted cave, and they become hopelessly lost. And, there was apparently a betrayal by this Juno, and a lot of guilt ensues.But, being in an underground cave is a very claustrophobic experience; I once went on such a trip with some friends, and even though we didn't go too far down, and the upper part was explored and well-lit, we went into the dark part, and it's not a pleasant experience. You can actually feel the darkness, it's incomprehensibly dark, and seeing these people become stranded, with nothing around but the cave walls, I got uncomfortable watching it. So, when they start to see creatures in the deeper parts of the cave, it would be easy to just say it's the mind playing tricks. But why does nobody ever believe the person who says they have seen something? This is an old cliche', but it adds to the discomfort of experiencing this.When you go into the depths like this, you don't know what you'll find, and sometimes, it's better not to find anything. You are in their turf, they are perfectly adapted to their surroundings. There are detractors of this film who say it isn't scary, and I believe such people probably take Ritalin. Psychological terror goes on in the viewer's mind, as well as on the screen, and when we finally see the creatures that live in the cave, you now have some people who are lost, injured, disoriented, and quickly losing hope, plus now, they are hunted by these ghastly things that would tear you apart as soon as look at you (if they had eyes, these things, living in total darkness, are blind from birth). One reviewer, who hated the film, and gave it one star, said \"...the monsters didn't look real...\"I would ask you, how are they supposed to look? They live underground, apart from people, and aren't even a real species to begin with. But given this mindset, they would probably say the same thing upon seeing a deep-sea fish for the first time. Hey, they don't \"look real\" either.This film has probably the bleakest ending I have ever seen. (spoiler here)The main character, the one who lost her family in the car crash, is the sole surviver, and imagines escaping, in a hallucination sequence, and even though the photography here is spectacular, beautiful landscape, it is ruined by a gag-inducing moment, a startling moment, and a return to the bottom of the cave. This is her real \"descent.\" One into complete insanity, with positively no means of escape. It's an uncomfortable film to watch, and following the events as it does, it achieves what suspense and horror films set out to do.And I don't think I will go into another cave. No thanks, I'll pass...",

    "review/text": "I heard lots of good things about this movie when it was in theaters and again when it first came to DVD. When it comes to horror films, I usually enjoy movies that build the tension and then go for a good scare instead of typical slasher films or movies that focus only on gore. So this sounded like it was right up my alley.Visually the film is extremely effective. The caverns and caves look very real, and for anyone who gets claustrophobic, this movie is one to steer clear from. The lighting also well done, giving us enough to see by, but also providing lots of shadows that movie and twist as the light sources move. Sound and music are also very effective, heightening mood and providing lots of good scares. How about the gore? Well the movie does have some bloody bits in it, but the most disturbing section was a broken bone peaking out of the skin and needing to be reset. The combination of the sounds, the visuals, and the acting made me squirm in my seat.The story itself is simple. Five women go into an uncharted cave, get trapped deep within the ground and find horrible creatures that want to devour them. However Neil Marshall who wrote and directed the film gives us a bit more. Each of the five women have their own histories, personalities and weaknesses. We get to know them a bit before the adventure begins, and when things start going bad, we learn even more. This intricacy works for and against the movie. On the one hand, it creates believable characters, who you root for and sympathize with. On the flip side, it provided a couple of interesting places for the movie to go, and yet it seemed that movie went with the most obvious and least satisfying path. I don't want to say more without giving away spoilers, but I think the movie could have worked even better as a psychological horror, instead of a monster movie.The acting is stand out. All five women give great performances. Since each of the characters has a distinct personality and history, this gave them more to work with and each of them does a great job. It was also nice to see fresh faces in these roles. My only minor quibble was their diverse accents made some of the dialogue a bit difficult to catch. The folks playing the monsters do a great job as well. They don't have dialogue but thier movements convey all the hunger and threat you need.This is a very good horror film, much better than the recent stuff we've been getting lately It was scary, disturbing, and moved at a good pace. I confirmed that I never want to go cave diving... ever. It also confirmed that good horror films can still be made in this day and age. I look forward to Mr. Marshall's next film.",

    "review/text": "A group of six adventurous women are all set for their first adventure since tragedy struck one of their families. The last trip was white water rafting and this one will be spelunking. Plans are made and the women meet up in the Appalachian mountains. They hike to their cave which looks like a Yucatan sinkhole and begin their adventure. Things are moving smoothly and the women are having fun. But a small rockfall blocks a narrow passage they need to use to exit. Then the truths start to come out. They are not in the cave they thought and they have no maps. The cave is previously unexplored so they have no idea if there is another way out. But with no other choice, they set out deeper into the cave to try and find a way out. If they don't then they will die and no one will know where they are.Further into the cave system it becomes apparent that they are not alone. There are other things that look sort of like people but are pale and blind. They also happen to be excellent climbers, fast, strong, and vicious. Now the women have a two front war on their hands. One the one side they have to fight the cave to find their way out. On the other side they have the cave creatures that think they are their next meal. Tension, action, and desperation mount and time is running out. Will they get out? If they do, who will survive? You will have to watch it to find out.Although remarkably similar to Jeff Long's book THE DESCENT there is nothing in the film, packaging, or extras that makes any mention of it. This is an unusual film in that except for in the first few minutes, the entire cast is female. There is no testosterone-fueled action here and yet it is not needed. The film works. There were a few subtle scenes that actually made my hackles rise (fewer than ten films have managed that). The caves look like real caves and not flat-floored movie caves. The lighting is handled so that it seems like the cavers are supplying all of the light and yet nothing is missed. The tension and action build asymptotically. Slowly at first but then faster and faster. A very well-done film. Check it out.",

    "review/text": "If you're looking a really good horror film, this is it! It's got everything dark and clausterphobic scenes, jump out scares and psychological terror and not to forget a lot of really horrifying things living in the caves. I'm sure you've read reviews that gave you a summary on what the film is about so you probably already know the plot. All the women in this film did outstanding performances not just for a horror film but also for a film itself which only adds on to what makes it so successful. It's so nice to see that a horror movie has some backstory on each of the characters especially the main character because it adds more psychological to the film like i said earlier. So again if you're looking for a really good horror film with strong performances from the actresses and a good story with great twists to keep things from getting dull and buckets of blood and gore which is what a horror film is supposed to have, then i would highly reccommend this film. I would also highly reccommend seeing the unrated original cut because i believe it will have both the uk and the u.s. ending to choose from. See the original uk ending it's a lot better and makes a lot more sense than the u.s. one not to spoil it too much but with the original you basically get both endings because the u.s. they cut it short so with the original the movie will last a few minutes longer if that makes sense? As for the full screen maybe it's only full screen because this was originally a uk film so maybe they don't have widescreen there for example the driver's seat in a car is on the right not the left. Different countries do different things i don't know or maybe the studio hasn't produced a widescreen since it was presented as widescreen in theaters so there must be a widescreen. But Widescreen Full Screen it really doesn't matter to me and I don't know why it matters to anyone else either i mean they only cut a little bit of the picture off when they crop it for the full frame and you only see a little bit more left and right for the widescreen it's not like we're seeing a different movie here it's the same thing. Although I will usually buy the widescreen dvd movies unless they're all sold out at the store that i'm at because it's kinda riddiculous to drive all the way to another store just so i can get the widescreen dvd movies. You know what i mean? is it really worth it? I sure don't think so but that's just me.",

The buidup to the real threat is fantastic, and theaters will be filled with screams when the movie hits the U.S next month. I think the American studio cut the real ending off so they can sell the 'unrated' DVD afterwards. They know they have a hit on their hands, so they will milk it for all it's worth.

I watched it alone (how scary could cave monsters be when you're at home?) and it really stuck with me that night. It wasn't the monsters; it was the atmosphere. The Descent takes place in a cave. It's dark, wet and claustrophobic. I found the setting disturbing and very, very scary.What I liked the most was the way the characters are portrayed. These are all strong, intelligent, capable women. There are enough character traits provided to distinguish each woman, but these remain mostly subtext. There are no ditzy blonds, no comic relief characters, and no 'red shirts.' When these women go down, they go down fighting.It's not perfect, of course. There is too much gore for my taste, although at least the camera doesn't linger. As other reviewers have noted, we get too many clear looks at the monsters, which diminishes the scare. However, it seemed to me that we as viewers were getting a much clearer look than the characters do.The ending that I saw (US unrated version) worked for me, as did the general darkness of the film (physical and mental).

    "review/text": "Neil Marshall comes through for English horror again with the best genre film of 2005! A group of friends enter an uncharted cave, but after a collapse, they are forced to struggle through the serpentine passageways to find daylight. Too bad they aren't alone.. The craftsmanship implored in the careful writing and making of this film is unmatched in recent horror, and Marshall is able to make the first half of the film (completely devoid of monsters) even more terrifying than the climax. Gut-wrenching scenes of claustrophobic cave crawling, the unseen in the dark, and protruding bones are just a few of the universal fears that are tapped into, creating an immediate emotional bond between the characters and the audience. The women may not be given complete back stories, but what works is that they are portrayed as real people. In what situation in real life are we given flashbacks or do we commonly reveal our personal histories in our daily dialog? Rather, Marshall has written distinct cadences and personalities that distinguish a group of individuals rather than a group of talking heads.Then, there are the monsters. By the time the cave dwellers enter the film, it is already established as a terrifying and successful feature, but the vicious Gollum-like monsters in the film heighten the tension and fear to a whole other level. Though I typically despise surprise scares, Marshall has perfectly timed reveals for the creatures to scare the piss out of the audience. Though humanoid, they have regressed into bat like creatures hunting by sound, which makes for creepy visuals and allows the characters a plausible advantage in attempting to fight them off and escape. As the title implies, the film is not just a descent into the cave, as a surface level reading might suggest, but also a descent into madness for several of the characters, pushed to the brink of sanity at the thought of being trapped and having to fight for their lives against the impending foes. Our lead heroine, Sarah, takes control and makes a fighting effort, leading to tons of monster bloodshed which are handled with fantastic FX and gore.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",

    "review/text": "This is hands down one of the scariest films ever made. Horror is my favorite genre, and I was so tired of seeing these horrible, pointless remakes being pushed out one by one. But then this little unexpected gem came out, and it blew me away. It takes skill to truly terrify your audience, and Director Neil Marshall was more than capable. Its as if Marshall watched The Cave, and said to himself, \"This could be made so much better.\"Whoever dares to compare this to The Cave has obviously never watched these two films. Where The Cave was a piece of garbage, The Descent is a truly spectacular film that will make you nervous from beginning to end. The blood used in this film isn't there for the sake of being there, it is used intelligently, not moronically like the Saw or Hostel films. There are no stupid characters here, either. Almost all of these women are likable, and you are going to care about them once they descend into madness.Video: This is one of the best transfers I have ever seen. Even in the darkest scenes, this film looks outstanding. Detail is very strong in all areas. What really caught my attention is that there was no grain in the dark scenes, which is very impressive. This is demo material all the way.Audio: The PCM 6.1 Uncompressed soundtrack was upgraded on my PS3 to a PCM 7.1 Uncompressed soundtrack, and this is where the film truly shines. The surrounds are used very well, and the soundtrack was well balanced. This is demo material.Extras: I haven't seen all of them, but there is a lot here.If you have yet to see this film, what are you waiting for?If you have seen this breath of fresh air, and loved it as much as I do, then what are you waiting for?Buy this Blu-ray!",

The Descent is a claustrophobic, oozing, gut-munching feast for horror fans, replete with a creepy, \"no-way-out\" feel and chock full of abominable, bat-like humanoid creatures with a taste for flesh. These are easily the most interesting horror villains in recent years. Who are they? What are they? Where did they come from? How long have they been down there? Imagine their gleeful suprise when a crew of old friends decide to explore their bleak subterranean domain in the dense hills of Appalachia. The dinner bells are a-ringin'. Carnage and compound fractures ensue as the ladies first find themselves trapped miles below the earth's surface in an \"unexplored\" cave system and then at the mercy of the \"Crawlers\", and from there on in it's a race to the surface with those slow of foot becoming lunch. The Descent may feel like two movies folded into one, but it works. Mucho bloody fun for genre fans.",

It is off the Hollywood grid and that makes for a very gritty, down and dirty feel-- the opposite of the slick junk American studios turn out.The characters are really well written and acted. It is a treat to see a film starring all females-- adult, fully developed, strong females, who never mention shopping.The story has a lot to say about human nature. It is also incredibly visceral, terrifying, and sickening. I would have been scared and filled with dread if they had just stuck to getting trapped in a cave. But then the things that live in the cave came out. I was pulling the covers up to my nose and screaming like a sissy. This movie is not for the faint of heart. I think my mother would quite literally die from fear if she saw this. Awesome.",

    "review/text": "How about something original for a change? I thought that's what \"The Descent\" might be. Wrong.Scary films, at least the majority, have become Gore Films over the past decade. The occasional, really spooky, rare treat pops up and surprises me, like The Others (back in 2001). No gore, no intenstines, no copying of a dozen other movies. Unfortunately many horror movies seem to copy from others, and blatantly. The fact that \"The Descent\" takes place in a subterranean cave is possibly the only original thing going for it (and I'm not certain that I haven't seen this setting before as a major scary movie location).Some good vibes from critics and word of mouth, and even Stephen King's praise, encouraged me to check out this film. Remind me to ignore movie critics and Stephen King from now on. It seems that people must enjoy gore and sadism in scary films these days. Why else would they praise this movie? Maybe that's all that they expect from new horror films, because of Saw, Hostel, some recent remakes, and such. What a shame.Like \"Deliverance\", this film introduces us to some thrill-seekers who are ready to bite off more than they can chew. Like \"Dead Calm\", there is a tragic accident at the beginning. Like \"The Shining\", the camera looms high over the car winding its way through a mountain road. Like every other horror movie before, we are shown the Night Before The Terror when we are introduced to the characters; and in the morning we are shown the Photograph of the Happy People who unknowingly may be going to their doom. Like \"The Hills Have Eyes\", there are nasty things hiding, who have been there for a long time and have adapted to the environment. They are hungry.This film is bonecrackling, bloody, stomach turning, suspenseful, gory stuff. That's not a compliment. This is all nothing we haven't seen before. What a disappointment.The women are incredibly, unrealistically fierce and formidable when faced with the vicious creatures. Funny, but there was no backstory about these gals all being self defense experts, and yet they conveniently knew how to kill an albino cave cannibal in less than ten seconds. It was all like hyped-up superhero action/violence. Ho hum. Not scary.And the filmmakers show entirely too much of the monsters. Remember, guys, in future, less is more. And less is also scarier. You can leave something to the audience's imagination. We're not cave dwelling freaks, thank you very much. Overall, I was not very impressed at all with this movie. I want something more than the usual 'no brainer' junk that Hollywood spoon-feeds the audience.**** Spoilers ahead...Proceed at your own peril! ****Before the women head underground, the filmmakers make a huge point of showing us that the stupidest character has intenionally left the guidebook behind in the car. This was unnecessary; instead, couldn't the book have eventually, accidentally fallen into a dank, gooey pit at some point while the women are spelunking? We will soon discover how stupid this Idiot Woman really is, anyway, when we learn that she's jeopardizing her pals by leading them to the unexplored cave, not the one they were supposed to enter. The guidebook isn't even necessary in the film.The last ten or fifteen minutes of this film really stank. We are given not only a nasty, ridiculously savage act of revenge against Idiot Woman, but then we are deceived by a dream sequence that is disguised as a happy ending. My eyes are rolling in annoyance. There was so much possibility there, especially with the ending. But again, there is mimicry, even in the dream: like the ending of the original 1974 \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", the survivor escapes, delerious and disturbed but very much alive. Turns out that the woman in \"The Descent\" isn't so lucky. And neither are we.",

Cleverly, he's got all the `heroes' as women, only they're not \"screaming at anything that moves, falling down at the first ridiculous opportunity, looking for a guy to rescue them\" women - these are strong women, in an intriguing scenario, who realise the only way out of it, is fighting their way out. Think of Ripley meets Clarice Starling.I'd heard it had received good reviews, but then I've heard that so many times and been disappointed. What a refreshing change it was to find a movie that lived up to the hype.If you like action or horror, or just a rollicking good ride, you really have to see this",

    "review/text": "Having had to sit through the \"horror\" films that the Hollywood studios have given hideous birth to these past couple of years, I was in the mood for some good old fashioned imported hair raising terror. I had read about this film before going to see it, mostly because I had read a novel of the same title by Jeff Long which is about a terrifying cave exploration gone wrong, but this movie directed by Neil Marshall is a completely different story although similar in its originality. I dragged my husband to see this last night, promising him a different experience than all the horror movies as of late. We both are sick of paltry remakes of Japanese films, and big budget stinkers that involve lots of water and hair, and rely heavily on computer generated scares , This movie is a serious monster movie for a generation without monster movies. I really missed the good old days where the baddies were flesh and bone; the stories were fresh and didn't need too much elaboration, and I had the chance to see some unknowns get massacred. This movie delivered all that to us and more, its scary but not cheesy it has unknowns which is so rare nowadays to see a fresh face in a imaginative movie. it had an awesome story line, that was full of symoblism of course but not so blatant that you were rolling your eyes and saying \"okay, cave wombs, blood, rebirth i get it\" the movie also had great effects for a 6 million dollar budget, and I left feeling like I had a refreshing adrenaline horror filled enema, cleansing all the \"the saws, the grudges, the rings, the darkwaters, etc\" out of my system.

    "review/text": "Because horror movies have effectively been told in a number of ways, it's difficult to determine exactly which elements are needed in order for them to be good. I began thinking about this after seeing \"The Descent,\" a high-tension roller coaster ride that left me more puzzled than exhilarated. This was an incredibly unstable film, lost within a maze of unfinished ideas. It reminded me of a misguided three-act play, each act characterized by wild shifts in storytelling methods. Yes, certain parts worked in and of themselves, but when put together, it turned into a chaotic, messy film.The first act is grounded in humanity (and I mean that in more ways than one), focusing solely on the interactions between six female rock-climbing enthusiasts. Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), Juno (Natalie Mendoza), Beth (Alex Reid), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (MyAnna Buring), and Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) gather in a remote area of the Appalachian Mountains one year after Sarah lost her husband and daughter in a car crash. While she's understandably still upset over the whole incident, she's willing to rejoin the group and have a little adventure.The second act is the psychological portion of the story. While Juno's personality isn't fully developed, it can safely be assumed that she's the more reckless, ego-driven one. At one point she says something to the effect of, \"If there's no risk, why bother?\" This is apparently the motto she lives by, and because of that, she convinces the others that they should all explore a network of tourist-friendly caves hidden deep beneath the mountains. What she neglects to tell them is that they're actually going into an unexplored area, one she hopes they can claim as their own. Once they enter, they quickly learn that they're in a very unpredictable environment; they encounter pitch darkness, deep pits, unstable ledges, and narrow passages that could collapse at any moment. All of these scenes are tense, bringing on bursts of panic, blame, and uncertainty. For a while, it becomes a matter of pulling themselves together if there's to be any hope of escape.It then becomes a matter of survival at any cost. That's because the third act begins, and it turns the film into a gory creature feature by introducing a pack of slimy, humanoid predators with carnivorous appetites. At this point, all traces of plot cohesion are lost; it would have been just as effective if the three acts were expanded, separated into their own stories, and released as individual films. I say this because each act was completely different in genre, tone, and style. By the time the creatures are brought into the story, crucial details suddenly become irrelevant. The biggest one concerns Sarah's daughter, Jessica (Molly Kayll). The audience is initially shown quite a few haunting visions that plague Sarah on a regular basis (such as birthday cakes and an impaled windshield). But they dwindle in frequency during the second act, and by the third act, they're completely gone.I guess the car crash and Jessica's death weren't as important as the filmmakers led us to believe they were. If anything, they were nothing more than filler material, meant to kill time before getting to the good parts of the story, the ones with scary creatures. It was as if the filmmakers were saying, \"Who cares about that old subplot? We now have monsters and blood to keep them entertained.\" But if they wanted monsters and blood so badly, they probably should have created something that could support those elements for the entire film. It might not have been as compelling a story, but at least then we wouldn't have to waste our time investing in characters we didn't need to invest in.And then there's the ending, which left me unfairly baffled. I obviously can't describe it in detail, but I'll say this much: one of the characters makes a particularly drastic decision. It was a decision I didn't feel she needed to make; it was not only an unnecessary thing to do, it was also an amoral one. The scene was over the top in a bad way, making one feel as cheated as if they had been watching an anticlimactic plot twist. It would be wrong of me to say that I expected something more inspiring, but I definitely expected something more appropriate. It probably would have been a good thing to re-shoot the ending, even if the rest of the film's incompatible elements were left alone.Based on this assessment, it would seem that one of the necessary components for a good horror movie is consistency. \"The Descent\" can't decide what kind of film it wants to be, and that made it an especially mind-numbing experience. This isn't to say that it doesn't have its good points; it actually has quite a few of them, especially during the last half of the movie. Most of those scenes are hidden in shadow, leaving much of the imagery left to the audience's imagination. That's certainly an effective way of delivering scares; what's not seen is always more frightening than what is seen. I just wish it had been a cohesive journey, one that didn't rely on unnecessary shifts in plot and structure.It's a mystery why ads for \"The Descent\" included comparisons to Ridley Scott's \"Alien.\" They're only fair to the smallest degree: in both movies, small groups of people are trapped in a confined area and stalked by an otherworldly being. They also both have that sense of panic and desperation about them, conveying the confusion and fear the characters are going through. But \"Alien\" was a much more carefully crafted film, it's intent never wavering, it's story consistently terrifying. \"The Descent\" only has moments of effectiveness, ones that unfortunately don't add up to very much. I give it credit for trying, though; the idea behind it was definitely a good one. It just needed to be in the hands of a more focused writer/director.",

What really worked for me, was that the light was only really provided by the character's lights on their helmets. That was it. So you can never fully see what's on the screen. And believe me, it really works. Although, at points for me, it didn't, cos I was muddling up some of the characters, and the ones I wanted to live, didn't.The actresses were really good, especially Shauna McDonald, who managed to pull the role off, despite being totally covered in blood at one point. Lovely. I really liked Holly's character (and the accent!) What made the film really mind blowing for me, was the start. Viewers literally get thrown into the thick of things, and I was sitting there going \"That car's not going to hit them surely, it's just ...\" Oh dear. BANG. Fast forward a year later, and the film really kicks off. But was that an underlying story somewhere? Sarah's (Shauna McDonald) husband seemed to be hiding something, and later, Juno says that they all lost something in the crash. Just a little something I noticed.Keep a close eye out early on when they're in the caves, you do actually see the creatures watching them. I didn't notice it straight away, but got it pointed out to me. The creatures weren't actually shown to the actresses until they had to actually film with them, and then they got their reaction for real. That must have been some reaction!All in all, a really simplistic but scary movie, with a really freaky cover. The cover alone is enough to send shivers up your spine.",

Might as well get all the bang for your buck, right?**********Additional comments from November 20, 2007:I listened to both commentary tracks on the DVD. Both are interesting, but the one with the director and 5 of the 6 girls is better. Not hard to guess why they jokingly referred to this film as \"Six Chicks with Picks\". At the start of the Blooper Reel, right after the footage of the six actresses belching during takes, is some footage of one of the Crawlers doing his best Mick Jagger imitation (and he's pretty good!).Not all Director Commentary tracks are interesting. But of the two on this DVD, the second one offered (the one with Director and Cast) is worth a listen.The only thing I can think of that would have made the Special Features section even better would be a \"Music Only\" track. David Julyan's score is haunting and creepy.And in one of the commentaries, the director commented on the sparse use of CGI in this film. He believes that CGI should enchance the physical reality, not take the place of it. Are you listening, George Lucas?",

    "review/text": "Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) could use some cheering up. Just one year ago, she lost her husband and her only daughter to a bad car accident. In an effort to cheer her up, five of her best friends take her on a vacation into the Appalachian Mountains for some routine spelunking. Things go horribly wrong, however, when they find themselves trapped and without a map inside one of the caves. Unfortunately for them, this cave has yet to be thoroughly explored and an unknown threat lurks in the darkness, ready to attack and threaten their solidarity and sanity.Writer/director Neil Marshall spends ample time building up the characters to the point where they feel real, but also wastes no time in getting to the point. It isn't long before our characters are submersed into the abyss from which they spend 90 minutes of the film trying to escape. A claustrophobic's nightmare come true, the film makes sure you're in the cave with the characters as they fight for their lives with a careful balance of character development and spooky atmosphere, achieved by its stunning cinematography and authentic location. By the time you get to the gore and the creature effects, the movie has already done its job and the rest is just icing on the cake.In fact, that's pretty much what sets \"The Descent\" apart from most modern horror stories. Rather than relying on outlandish death scenes and over-the-top gore, it's slightly restrained in its old-school approach that values tension over eye-candy. To be blunt, the death scenes are probably the last thing you'll remember from this film. What you'll likely take away from it is an unmistakable and unforgiving tone, a healthy portion of unforgettable imagery (see: climbing up a hill of human skulls) and an ending that will stay with you for days. It's a well-rounded, well-written and effectively directed film that warrants repeat viewings to absorb it all. With this film, Neil Marshall has certainly earned himself a spot in the echelon of iconic horror movie directors, and is truly a visionary to keep an eye on.A sequel is currently on the horizon, although what would possess Sarah to enter that cave again remains to be seen, especially if you are to go by the original ending -- found in the \"Original Unrated Cut\" (the true version of the film) -- which leaves nowhere for a sequel to go. By itself, though, it stands alone as a modern classic for a reason and a film that will effectively creep out and thrill audiences for many decades to come. When this decade is looked back upon in future years, \"The Descent\" will no doubt sit at the top of the pile of films that helped define horror movie cinema in the new millennium.",

    "review/text": "I'm not typically accustomed to going \"gaga\" over horror films. It's not that I don't like them, I love them--but truth be told, it's hard to find genuinely good ones. I'm entertained by lots of the gory, splatter films that have recently dominated the box office. Usually, however, it's a matter of accepting the limitations within these films and getting whatever enjoyment you can out of the scenarios. It's been a very long time since I thought of a current horror movie as a 5 star event, so nothing could have surprised me more than \"The Descent.\"The preliminary setup is a good one. Our heroines begin to explore some unknown, uncharted cave systems and quickly become trapped. Now our ladies must use their resourcefulness and intelligence to try to get out. The dynamics start to play out between the women--good and bad--and a real fear for survival starts to set in. We are squarely in a man versus nature psychological thriller atmosphere. It recalls for me \"Open Water\"--a film whose horror is about helplessness and being stranded, not about sharks.But just as soon as I was sure where I was headed, the rug was pulled out. The last third becomes a monstrously bloody battle for survival. It is so well choreographed, I was sucked in wholeheartedly. And far from being victims--our heroines exhibit intelligence, brutality, resilience, loyalty and a real survival instinct. We've got some real female empowerment going on! For pure horror, this film goes out with a real bang.I was completely blindsided by this one. There's a good screenplay, a credible backstory, appealing actresses, great cinematography and nice effects.\"The Descent\" may not be the \"best\" movie I see this year--but as a pure adrenaline rush, I promise you it will be one of my favorites.

These films are entertaining enough, but eventually you feel like you're watching the same garbage over and over again. With that said, I didn't expect to be very impressed with The Descent, in spite of its excellent reviews. But I watched it anyway and I was very impressed. Instead of falling back on the same old settings and sadistic villains, The Descent opened up an entirely new and creative horror landscape. And the villains were more interesting and intriguing than your run of the mill axe-murderer. Another interesting aspect of the film was the professional nature and technical ability of the protagonists. It was nice to see a horror film in which all of the players were skilled and pretty tough. It was hard to pick out who would survive, because no single character stood out as the token slow, cowardly loser. There were a few shameless `BOO!' scenes in which one character `accidentally' scared another by sneaking up on her. But I guess if you're in a cave that probably happens. Aside from that though, the film had very few weak points. If you are looking for a well crafted and fresh horror film that will make you enjoy the horror genre again, The Descent will not disappoint.",

It's a descent into the unknown!I will not talk about the story, because one key element in this movie is surprise, and once you get struck by it, it'll be NON-STOP action until the ending credits.

If you're not into horror movies, but do enjoy the result of a mix of good violence and blood, then.. well try it out and see if you like it.Watch it alone, watch it in the dark, raise the speakers and embark in a life-changing experience.And in the end.. i bet you'll think twice about exploring a cave.",

I was convinced that the screenwriter did not actually read the book, but just heard about the story from a friend of a friend, and kind of made something up around the idea. The movie is good, but really has nothing to do with the book other than some demon like creatures in a cave- and I must say again, the book is such a great read. I might have rated this movie with more stars if I had not had such high expections unmet by comparing it to the book for the duration.The Descent(the book) by Jeff Long one of those stories that you'll want to tell everyone about as you read it, and you'll be loaning out your copy to everyone that you can convince to take it. Tell then that if you're not a reader, read the first chapter. SO FREAKY! If you \"kind of read sometimes\", read the first three chapters. The first chapter is about some mountain explorers, the second chapter is around legends from a native african tribe, and the third chapter is from a military perspective. The rest of the book goes in to connecting the three perspectives (individual explorers, legends, and military involvment) into a thrilling story that will stick with you. If you're an avid reader, read all of The Descent and then it's sequel, Deeper. Deeper starts with some missing trick-or-treaters, and goes more into scientific and religious discussions around Long's idea of devils.",

    "review/summary": "Doesn't Go Quite Deep Enough",
    "review/text": "This movie follows the long-standing convention of having friends talk to each other in flippancies. No one really communicates with anyone else here. This group of women who get together periodically to empower themselves by engaging in some grueling sports challenges - flip off, swear at, and breeze past each other. When confronted with amazing natural phenomena and obstacles, their reaction is also generally not awe and certainly never poetry. It's usually just another curse. Few, if any, meaningful sentences are exchanged.I know our society has grown increasingly rude and raunchy. But when I get together with women friends, we don't talk that way. We still do hunker down and talk more earnestly about politics and the environment - and most of all - about things of the heart. However movie directors seem to think it's more modern and visually arresting to have groups of young \"friends\" just bash and banter against each other in the most superficial ways.The trouble with following this format, especially in a movie like \"Descent,\" is that we don't get to know or care about any of the characters. I couldn't distinguish one gal-pal from another most of the time. This trouble was compounded by the fact that most of the action takes place in a cave where there is only the dim orange, smudgy, glow from various flares to shed any light at all on the characters.When the movie's menace appears though, there are some genuinely wrenching, suspenseful scenes. If only it was all happening to someone we knew and identified with more.The two DVD director commentaries are generally a waste of time. They are annoying frat house laugh-overs. If you do take the time to listen to one or both of them though, don't do it right after the movie. Let some time elapse, or else you will ruin whatever grim, gripping emotional impact the movie might have had on you.However the \"Behind the Scenes\" bonus feature is worthwhile. It shows how some of the movie's special effects were painstakingly created, and it shows some of the lively family-like atmosphere that develops among movie cast and crew members. (If only some of that sort of chemistry had gotten translated to the characters on-screen!)The Bonus Material also contains interesting information about alternate endings that were considered for \"Descent.\" In spite of the director's/writer's guffawing, superficial intent throughout much of this film, I think they hit on the right ending after all. The one they went with opens the door to new subtleties of interpretation. And it leaves a poignantly haunting last image. It might make you consider your own last shot, and whose memory you'll have to sustain you through that moment.",

However, having heard enough good things about \"The Descent\" plus the fact that the director of \"Dog Soldiers\", my favorite werewolf film, directed this as well, I was interested enough to keep a watchful eye out for a good sale. Well, when a DVD goes on sale for four bucks, I have no fear. When I pay next to nothing for a 2 disc DVD with minimal expectations I am usually pleasantly surprised; \"The Descent\" is no exception. In fact, it is probably one of the more original, well made horror films I've seen in a while.In the extras, it is mentioned that this film has elements of three horror greats combined into one; \"The Shining\", \"Alien\" and \"Deliverance\". It's difficult to argue with that comment. This film explores the effects of stress on the human psyche, an ensemble in the path of horrific danger in cramped confines and a catastrophic collision of cultures for 6 cocky thrill seekers. All of this is accomplished with great flair. For times sake let me break down some basic things to help you get a picture of what this film experience is like without retelling the plot/story...Lookout!! Here come the bullets!!THE FILM-If you have claustrophobia, please stay as far away from this as you can. Any normal person will feel the pressure of the confining cave. Imagine \"Aliens\" only twice as cramped.-I thought character development was great. At first you're thinking; \"Oh that's the clich&eacute; sassy chic and that's the clich&eacute; tough chic and that's the clich&eacute; crazy chic... and so on. However, as time passes and the stress level rises, you get to see deeper into these surface dwellers personalities. No one is ever as simple as they seem at first sight.-The story would seam simple enough, yet its brilliance is in its subtleties. Yes, the crux of the story is; 6 gal pals have an ill fated adventure into a cave and encounter more than geological danger. But you don't get a six person ensemble for the simple convenience of body count as is the case with many horror films. Nearly everything said or done leading up to the cave expedition has a point.-The set-up is fairly long. It takes about one third of the films length to get things going. In all fairness, none of the set-up could be considered pointless (as stated above).-The women's nemesis in the film (Cave Crawlers) is fairly realistic considering the circumstances of their existence. They behave as one would expect for predators. Their animalistic traits make them very unpredictable and frightening. I actually had a slight empathy for them since the women were invading their home. However, I empathized more with the women. When it comes to survival; take no prisoners! (And the crawlers started it!)-There is ample gore in this film. They don't show every horrific act, but when they do, they go all out. Some of the gore is a bit gratuitous in its depiction... ...and highly appreciated! The director does not shy away from lengthy and close gore shots. This would be one of my minor criticisms of the film. Those long gore shots were almost comedic and a bit out of place in what is mostly a very serious horror film. I said \"almost\". The graphic gore does serve to heighten the emotional state of the women..-Near the end of the film is a fairly large melee between the surviving women and the crawlers. This is one great frenzied and desperate fight scene (much like the kitchen fight in \"Dog Soldiers\"). It brings the emotional state of the women to a clear apex and is just a really cool fight! It is brilliantly edited and beautifully staged.-The music is purely functional. It does not garner your attention yet serves to set mood and heighten tension. What more could you ask for?-The sets are mostly rocks and tiny tunnels. Very convincing.-The ending is not what appeared in theaters here in the States. Thanks goodness!! The ending as it appears here completely leaves it up to your imagination how things turn out. I often have trouble with ambiguous endings but not here. My fear is the sequel will take a stupid path instead of one of the cool ones in my head. In fact, a sequel just might ruin this brilliant ending.THE DVD-2 discs for cheap, cheap, cheap!!! (I have not yet watched disc 2).-Good picture and sound.-Ample extras with the standard fair plus outtakes and deleted cuts.No complaints.In summary:-You should like gory horror films.-You should have patience enough to endure ample character development.-You should not be claustrophobic. This would be very, very bad for you.-You should be able to enjoy a movie without any male characters.-You should be able to live with an undefined end to the story.Of course these are only suggestions. If any of the above does not apply to you, you may still enjoy it. I thought it was a much better than average horror movie.",

    "review/text": "I didn't think this flick would be all that great, but I was pleasantly surprised. However you do have six women starring in a horror movie, that's 12 boobs people, none of which we see. So no nudity, but the story, frights, and blood more than make up for it. You have six female friends who like to go on adventures like white water rafting. After a tragic car accident, one of the women loses her daughter and husband.The next outing is planned by Juno, who fancies herself as leader of the group. SHe takes the girls to a massive underground network of caves. The other women are under the impression that these are the Borehdom Caves, but Juno had other ideas. She actually took the women to an unexplored cave system. She wants them to get the credit for discovering it and naming it. Well there is a cave in and the truth comes out as the women realized they are lost and possibly trapped.Now things really start to go wrong, one girl falls down a long shaft and shatters her leg. While four women help her, one woman sees 'something... something that looks human'. Now the fun begins.The cave system is inhabited by milky white, blind humanoid creatures with amazing climbing skills and sharp teeth that love to bite and chew through flesh. Now the women are separated and forced to fight their way out. But soon another one of Juno's little secrets is about to be discovered. While fighting the monsters, she accidently sends he axe claw through the neck of one of her friends. She ends up leaving her for dead.But the dying girl now knows the secret and tells the other woman who discovers her as she lays dying and begs for death. Turns out Juno had an affiar with the dead husband! Soon it is just Juno and the betrayed wife fighting their way through the caves. After a huge battle leaves them both bloodied and exhausted, Juno gets an axe through the leg and is left behind to be torn to pieces.As for the jilted wife's fate, the movie has a great twist that I will not spoil here. So for fun, frights, and fighting as fierce as you will find in '300', this is a great flick.",

It's not because it wouldn't be scary then, horror movies alway take place in a dark place and if you hear screaming or someone getting killed, you're gonna wonder how or what just happened! 'Cause that's what happened to me wile watching this. And how can those crawlers be real cavemen that are cannibals? There were no cavemen in America! There is no way that those crawlers could be people that just mutated and wanting eat any living things. This movie did have hardcore killings! I would give you another advice and not buy the DVD but just rent it. I can't wait for Descent 2 this year!",

    "review/text": "I wasn't really expecting much from 'The Descent.' From the description, a group of women go cave exploring. Soon enough, the women come across a mysterious noise or two, which rightly so freaks them out. After a bit, the women are trapped, scared, after taking a wrong turn, and in the dark. The source of the frightning sounds shows its face and begins terrorizing the women. Violence and sudden jumps ensue.From the opening of the film, when three female friends are whitewater rafting, we can tell the ladies are lifelong pals and adventerous at heart. Tragically, as one woman is driving home with her family, an accident occurs causing deep psychological and bodily harm to all in the vehicle.After a year, the woman decides to tag along with her friends again, along with another few women she meets. They decide to go cave dwelling to live life on the edge and to let out any deep seeded agression.The tension grows minute by minute as the women explore the inner depths of the cave. Danger lurks all around as either a long drop to the depths below are around the corner, or a potential cave in of the rocks surrounding the travelers may happen at a moments notice.The tension explodes when the friends come across a graveyard of bones mysteriously covering the ground in one portion of the dark cave. They soon realize they are not alone.These women are trespassers upon the grounds of an unknown, pale grey, blind creature who are in no mood to give directions towards home. Instead, they're hungry.The Descent brings to mind the 1987 film Predator. Not only because of the gurgling noise heard long before than the appearance of the creature(s), but also because of the build up and psychology of the actions.Each advesary has their weakness. This weakness must be discovered by the counterpart. Each of them have an advantage, which they use to defeat the other. There is a long time within the film which allows for more and more tension to be created. There are minor jumps and scares here and there until the real roller coaster ride begins and the action commences.It may be true that there are a lot of cliches in this film which are seen in almost every horror movie made. However, The Descent puts a twist on one or two of these cliches. Women as victims, for example; Normally a woman is saved by their 'boyfriend' or whichever man happens to be in the general area. But now, with women being the entire cast, each of them can be the heroes as well. The sudden reveal of the enemy in the dark is another example. Normally the first victim is easy picking and a slight gasp is heard among the audience. With The Descent, things don't go quite that smoothly.Overall this is a very good film for someone who just wants to escape the mundane exsistence of everyday life and everyday horror films. It's different, while at the same time remaining familiar. I was on the edge of my seat and clinching my fists throughout. My knuckles don't often turn white while viewing movies, but this time they did.Watch and enjoy!",

    "review/text": "I thought this movie was going to be no better than the hundreds of other horror movies out I painfully watched. Nonetheless, the Descent is a lot better than they.Now I don't think this movie is amazing as so many others here think, but it actually was a horror film that had me on the edge of my seat. For awhile it is pretty easy- going, with they just getting to the cave and beginning the journey into it, but eventually they get into some trouble that eventually leads them to some odd but nothing too scary of creatures. I mean they're ugly creatures, but are they really scary? No not really. But dangerous? Very much so. That's what keeps you on the edge of your seat is knowing it will not be easy at all to evade these creatures- especially when you have no idea where to run to finally escape them.This movie is dark, very dark actually to the point where you might be moving up close to screen just to see what is going on- which I didn't like to do- and the acting was pretty average. Nothing too bold, but the actors weren't lame either. A few of the women were pretty forgettable though. The creatures again were nothing really compared to some of the monsters I've seen in other films and the gore I felt was maybe done a little bit too much at times just to sicken us viewers.What was good about this film though was the feeling of confusion and the utter fear of possibly never getting out of the cave, while those life threatening creatures were just a few steps behind or ahead of you. This movie gives real chills because of that, and that is refreshing after sheer boredom of so many other new films.I recommend it to watch at least once. I would watch it again.3.5/5",

    "review/text": "Others have spent a great deal of time writing details about this movie. Instead, I'll make only a few observations.I always loved 'good' horror movies, but for many years I didn't know what differentiated 'good' from substandard fare. Good horror aren't just tales about horrifying events. Instead, they are tales about people in horrifying circumstances.The distinction is critical, and that's where the vast majority of horror films fail. They portray events without relating the horror to the film's characters - or worse, they leave us not caring at all and able only to think about the graphic nature of the film.Some people think \"The Descent\" is a movie about six women who 'descend' into a cave and are attacked by man-eating monsters. Yes, those things occur. But that is not what the movie is about. The monsters acted only as a catalyst, and the movie easily could have been made without them.If one actually watches \"The Descent\" instead of pre-dismissing it before the screening, there is much more to it. It is a tale about the protagonist's descent into savagery, and her final plunge into madness. It wasn't made in Hollywood, so don't look for a happy ending.This was not a perfect movie - there were significant flaws. However, at least for me, even the flaws could not interfere with the story-telling. Examples of a few flaws: In the film-making - there were at least two cheap-scares too many. Mr. Marshall should have trusted his material enough to leave them out, as this story did NOT need them. Story logic - if people are in a cave that contains bones and bodies of dozens (or more) of large, dead creatures, the stench would permeate the cave. Finding bodies would not be a surprise - you'd be looking for them. Creature design - they bore a striking resemblance to the 'Uber-vampires' in the 7th season of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\".The flaws faded to insignificance because of the strengths. I was surprised by this movie, pleasantly so. It was much more than I expected, and more than any horror movie has been for many, many years.I highly recommend it - although, if you are someone who really enjoys the \"Friday the 13th\" style of no-story/slasher/blood-guts/graphic violence, then you may not enjoy it very much - there is far more story than graphic violence.",

    "review/text": "The Descent (Neil Marshall, 2005)Here's the big letdown of The Descent: the movie gets a whole lot less scary when the bad guys show up. Here's the saving grace: by the time the bad guys show up, you'll probably be too creeped out to care.Marshall (who previously directed the underrated thriller Dog Soldiers) gives us the tale of Sarah (Late Night Shopping's Shauna MacDonald), an extreme-adventure-loving kind of gal, who with her friends and constant companions Beth (Last Orders' Alex Reid) and Juno (Hotel Babylon's Natalie Mendoza), does silly things like go whitewater rafting on rivers that could kill all of them. Her safe, boring husband (Paranoid's Oliver Milburn) and their daughter Jessica (newcomer Molly Kayll) are ironically killed in a car accident, and Sarah has a nervous breakdown. A year later, when she has seemingly recovered, Juno invites her and Beth on a caving expedition in rural North Carolina along with Becka (Saskia Mulder, late of The Beach), Holly (The Magdalene Sisters' Nora-Jane Noone), and Sam (MyAnna Buring, recently of the remake of The Omen). The six of them head off to the cave, and find themselves trapped after a minor earthquake shifts some rock in a narrow tunnel they've just come through. Worse, they find they're not alone...The first half of this movie should probably be avoided by anyone who has claustrophobia issues. It is here that the film's real capacity for fear lies-- in a bunch of people crawling through very small passages with thousands of tons of rock above them. During one particular scene, I was curled up in my seat eating my own hand. (You'll know it when you see it.) It is soon after that that the bad guys show up, and the movie becomes a pretty typical survival thriller, though Marshall does throw in a few twists and turns along the way that, unlike the popping-out-at-you cheap thrills of most survival thrillers, really do hit home on occasion. (Most, unfortunately, have little to do with the bad guys.) The raging exception is the film's final scene, about which I was prepared to rage for most of this review until I found out that about ninety seconds of the original cut of the film was lopped off at the end (the original footage can be seen at YouTube until the DVD shows up, for those interested). Someone in Hollywood needs to lose a job over the loss of those ninety seconds, which entirely change the tone and meaning of the film, tie up at least one major loose end, and add new shades of subtext to the title. If you see the film, hop on YouTube soon after and check out what you missed; without it, the last shot is typical cheap horror-film fare. (And it works that way in the original cut as well, but its impact is considerably lessened by its not being the actual last shot of the film.)I sound like a broken record in today's reviews, but I have to say it again, like I said for Bad Lieutenant and Lifeboat: this is not really a movie about going down into a cave and fighting for your life. This is a movie about characters-- most notably Sarah, but also Juno. It's the way they react to their surroundings, how they come to make the snap decisions they have to make in order to survive, the way the stress of the situation transforms them, that makes this, ultimately, a very worthwhile movie. It's well worth your time.American cut: ***Original cut: ****",

It had me jumping all the way through and totally wired by the end. Had trouble sleeping by the end. As far as horror movies go, this is one of the best I've seen in a long time.But like most horror movies, this lacked substance, which could have existed with a little more effort and about ten more minutes of film. The acting could have been better...but this isn't really the actors faults, they did well with what they had...and the ending...what's the deal with that? At first I was thinking, \"Awesome ending...\" then everything switches and you're back where you were five minutes before and I'm thinking, \"Well, that sucks.

After what appears to be a weird moment between Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and Paul (Oliver Milburn), which is Sarah's (Shauna Macdonald) husband. On their drive home, Paul and their daughter Jessica (Molly Kayll) are brutally killed in an automobile accident. Sarah wakes up in the hospital to learn of her family's demise.A year later the group meets again for a cave expedition intended to strengthen their friendship once again, and to help Sarah heal, as everything is still reminding her of her loved ones. What everyone doesn't know is that Juno, an experienced climber, has changed locations to a different cave because it has never been charted. She figures the group could then name their \"discovery\".Once in the cave, the women realize just how beautiful it is. What they don't realize is how ugly its going to get. As the group gets moving and starts to crawl through a claustrophobic tunnel, they soon get cut off from their only known way out after a small cave in blocks their path. Looking to Juno for answers, panic sets in as they realize her intentions. And that she doesn't have any answers.The movie sustains an unrelenting tension as the group must try to figure out how they are getting out of the cave. The lack of lighting solidifies each individual's horror of the dark and unknown. But worse than that, they begin to hear movement. No longer the peaceful sounds of water lazily dripping. Something is scurrying around them, and its fast. Or is there more than one?Before long, one of these creatures are actually seen by Sarah. The rest of the group finds it incomprehensible that there was even the slightest chance of anything living down this far. That is, until they find the feeding grounds.It's a fight for survival until the bitter end, between the Crawlers and the girls, and between Sarah and Juno. The movie captures your attention early and hooks you deep, without the need for gore. The good stuff is saved until the end. The great flow of this movie is how well it keeps you in until the ending bloody climax.And there is one last mindblower at the end ...[...]",

    "review/text": "This was truly a horrifying movie to experience and I do mean experience with a capital E! Many others here have already outlined the plot so I'm just going to give you what I enjoyed about this little film that will be a classic one day.The title alone is very clever as it refers to both the physical descent into the cave, but also the descent into madness. If that isn't enough, it suggests the descent of mankind itself as we watch these \"friends\" turn on each other.The dialogue and character interactions are extremely believable and played out by a brilliant cast of unknowns. The effects are minimal, but good. This film and story relies much more on anticipation, fear, suspense, and dread than anything tangible even though there is considerable blood and gore at key moments in the film that are certainly not for the squimish. In addition, the claustrophic elements of the film are enhanced when viewing this film at home. My wife and I watched this at midnight in our basement home theater room and I found myself needing air . . . desperately!I always like to check out what a film costs to make and I'm always impressed at how some writers, actors and directors can create a terrific film if they put more heart and soul into it than money. This film only cost about $4 million to make and earned nearly $30 million. That is a very nice profit and well deserved. The lastest Rocky film cost $24 to make and earned $100+ million. Movie producers would be wise to take a lesson from these smaller, but more artfully crafted films.One Compliant: The audio of the film (or DVD) could have been better. Many times my wife and I had to backtrack over what someone said. It seemed to be a combination of poor quality audio or DVD transfer and the strong accents of the English/Scottish actors as those folks have a terrible tendency to \"swallow\" their words (meaning words or phrases, particular near the end of sentences, can be inaudible or suffer from slurring). I guess one could put on the English subtitles to read what they say, but that can be distracting.",

Now it seems I enjoy horror movies for the makeup and special effects and story lines, not for the \"jump out of your seat\" rush of adrenaline you get from being scared. The Descent is the first horror movie in a long long time that actually had moments that made even me jump. If you are looking for a solid horror movie to watch with your girlfriend or whatever else, rent/buy The Descent, it's guaranteed to have the desired effect that so many other horror movies don't deliver.",

Anyway just the ending is different than one that was seen in US theatres. I wont spoil ending for you if you havent seen, but most know from youtube what its really suppose to be.

    "review/text": "Buoyed by a tremendously effective atmospheric horror and a claustrophobic sense of terror, THE DESCENT is indeed a riveting film experience, well directed by DOG SOLDIERS' Neil Marshall and containing good performances from its relatively all female cast.A group of six friends embark on a relatively routine spelunking adventure in the Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee. The group includes a woman who lost her husband and daughter in a tragic auto accident one year earlier and whose stability is undoubtedly questionable. They're not in the cave very long when the expedition's planner announces that this cave is one that has not been explored so no one knows that the group is in the cave. A cave in traps the women and soon they find that they are not alone...something deadly is stalking them.Marshall builds tension incredibly well, and unlike most movies set subterraneanly, the lighting lets us see pretty well what happens, even if the frenetic camera work is sometimes disturbing. There are some confusing moments regarding the accidental death of one of the team, and the typically ambiguous ending. But overall horror fans should delight in this exquisitely done flick.",

    "review/text": "In writer/director Neil Marshall's The Descent (2005), somewhere in the Appalachians, six female spelunkers looking for adventure, experience the terror of being stalked through underground caverns, by vicious, carnivorous, cave dwelling beings. Overcoming the initial panic, the women transition to survival mode, doing whatever they must to stay alive.It begins as just an ordinary excursion. After losing her husband and daughter in a tragic accident, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), is together again with Juno (Natalie Mendoza), and Beth (Alex Reid), looking to rekindle their friendship, on a spelunking expedition. Also in the team, are sisters Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and Sam (MyAnna Burning), along with newcomer Holly (Nora-Jane Noone). Entering the cavern, things are proceeding routinely, when a cave-in occurs. The women can't get out the way they came in, and while looking for some way out, suddenly find themselves under attack, by strange wall crawling creatures. With their number reduced to five, the group scatters into the darkness.There may be some issues with the backstory, as well as some technical issues related to cave exploration, but The Descent solidly delivers the thrills and scares, that most horror fans are seeking. With intense fights, and plenty of gore and graphic violence, the film scores high marks in the woman vs. monster department. The feeling of being driven to the extreme edge, is very real. The cave creatures move fast, their hissing and screeching, becoming a signal for terror. Hideous looking, and blind, the crawlers use some kind of internal radar for guidance, as they stalk their prey, and then attack relentlessly.The underground environment isn't pitch black as it should be, but the lighting is nicely done, giving the impression that the setting is reasonably realistic. The amount of gear that the women have seems a little light. Things like flashlights, eye protection, masks, gloves, and water seem to be in short supply or missing, but fortunately they do have their metal pickaxes along. The sea of bones that appear in several locations makes for a nice effect, but is not very realistic.Infidelity is made a highly significant matter, but is rather lost on an audience, who know almost nothing about the character's personal lives. Overall, Juno gets a something of a bad rap. In the initial attack, she's the only one fighting to defend a fallen comrade. The tragedy that happens to Beth is clearly an accident, but Beth makes it sound like it was deliberate. The ambiguous ending, leaves it unclear whether anyone has escaped. This intriguing question however, is answered in the sequel, The Descent Part 2 (2009), which features some members of the original film.All about facing a terrifying horror that comes out of the darkness, The Descent is highly effective at raising fear at a very base level. The all female cast, gives the creature feature an unusual spin, and the ladies acquit themselves, in a most skull-shattering fashion. The unrated edition, has some nice extras, including two commentary tracks. Neither is particularly informative from a purely technical standpoint, but there is some good information sprinkled among what is mostly chit chat.",

    "review/text": "There are two main problems with most horror movies: (1) they're not truly, deeply, get-in-your-guts-and-twist scary; (2) the characters/victims are portrayed so shallowly and/or unsympathetically you don't really care what happens to them. Neither of those shortcomings afflicts The Descent. Boy, don't they.The Descent tells the story of six friends, female adrenaline junkies all, who get together once a year for a different extreme sports adventure, always a different sport, always a different country. This year it's cave exploring in the United States' Appalachian mountains. When they're well underground a cave-in cuts them off, they must find a new way out. Eventually they discover there's....something else down there with them.That bare description of plot sounds like it could make a really cheesy horror film. Add that the six women are all played by relatively unknown actresses and the possibility of a groaner just gets better and better. However The Descent doesn't even stop at \"bad\" and goes straight for \"excellent.\" Script, direction, cinematography, acting, in this film are all top notch.This is easily the most truly frightening horror movie I've ever seen - and much of the scariest stuff occurs even before the monsters show up. (Not to give it away, but you **did** know that eventually there'd be monsters, right?) If you have any hint of claustrophobia in your system, some of the scenes of these terrified, lost women worming their way through pinprick, dead dark tunnels will literally make it hard for you to breathe. They did me.This movie does so many things right. For one thing, you ever notice how many horror films suffer from what I call the Idiot Syndrome, i.e. the people on-screen die because they do things only an idiot would? (I believe this is one of the primary appeals of a certain type of horror movie: we look at the idiots on-screen and feel good about ourselves by comparison. \"**I'd** never be that stupid.\") I'm not saying that none of these characters ever makes a bad decision, or that cumulative stress doesn't eventually start to wear. But the women in The Descent are, by and large, smart, tough individuals who, once the horror starts, all, to a greater or lesser extent, stay smart, tough individuals. Call it Post-Feminist Horror if you like, all I know is that I find a movie about hard, competent people in trouble infinitely more appealing than a movie about weak, incompetent morons in trouble. (Okay, there is one character who's reckless to the point of stupidity, but \"rush in where angels fear to tread\" is a well-established trait of hers long before it turns around and bites her in the butt.)In addition to its nicely done horror, The Descent is an amazingly well-drawn psychological drama. All the women come across as believable, distinct personalities, all in some way likable and admirable, at least to start. You **care** what happens to these people. The Descent is, along with a very different movie, Phone Booth, probably the ultimate example of what I call an \"elevator movie\" (a term based on a series of movies all appearing within a short time period in the Seventies, about people trapped in elevators) where you put a bunch of people in an enclosed space so they can't get away from each other, ratchet up the stress level, then sit back to watch what happens. And, as is the case so many times in real life, in even the best of us we find that the monsters inside are even more frightening than the monsters without.Watch this movie. If you appreciate a truly fine horror film, you will adore The Descent. And if you have nightmares afterward, don't say I didn't warn you.",

    "review/text": "\"The Descent\" is a good movie in almost every way. The tension and claustrophobia of being trapped in an unknown cave system is palpable. The previous movie of Neil Marshall was, in essence, a black comedy. There is none in here. Everything is horrifying, terrifying, thrilling and scary. Six girls trapped underground and a common enemy. This film brought two things to mind while I was watching it, Aliens and the Thing, these two movies set the bar when it comes to atmosphere, and this above all others is key to a good horror film. Neil Marshall seems to be a master of this, in an era when great horror films are tough to come by. From the very beginning this movie grabs you by your collar and doesn't let go. It seems to place right in the mix of everything that is happening, and emotion, what was the last horror film anyone has seen that had emotional attachment to its characters.The gore comes pretty hot and heavy in the second half of the film, and the ending of the film is appropriately surprising and bleak, without being corny. Another big plus in my book is that the \"creature\" FX aren't over-the-top and don't rely on much, if any CGI. When I first heard that \"The Descent\" was a \"creature\" film, I was kind of worried because I feel that those types of films have gone severely down-hill with the advent of the over-use of CGI...but this film doesn't fall into that category. Some of the acting isn't the greatest but it doesn't really detract from the film overall, and some seem to think that the first half of the film is slow. Personally, I think that the early sequences in the caves are a great \"tension-builder\" as things go from bad-to-worse, and right when you think it can't go any lower, the audience is clued in to the existence of the other \"inhabitants\" of the caves and all hell breaks loose. \"The Descent\" is a pretty good horror film and shouldn't be ignored.",

    "review/text": "Several months ago, I purchased a DVD called The Cave, which was about a group of men who get trapped in a cave with strange creatures hunting them down. I thought the movie was okay, but not great. Then, The Descent came out. I thought this was going to be a simple rehash of The Cave, but with women in it, instead of men, and I found myself not interested in seeing it. It wasn't until I read a review by Roger Ebert, who gave this movie an enthusiastic four-star rating, which is the highest score he gives out for a film, that I found myself going, \"Hmmmm.\" I decided to take a chance on it when the DVD came out. I'm now happy to say that this movie scared the living daylights out of me! I must've jumped at least a dozen times while watching it, not to mention screaming and yelling, \"Nooooo, don't do that!\" and \"Watch out behind you!\" I have to say that I'm not a big fan of movies with a lot of blood and gore and knife-welding maniacs. I usually prefer my \"horror\" movies to be subtle like in Shirley Jackson's The Haunting and Richard Matheson's Hell House. Though The Descent starts out in \"subtle\" mode, it's anything but during the last half. Still, I found myself totally engrossed and unable to turn away from what was happening. I found myself bonded with the characters and wanting them to survive the horrendous ordeal that they were experiencing.The Descent deals with six rather tough outdoorsy women who decide to explore an underground cavern in the mountains of North Carolina. One of the ladies, Sarah, is still recovering from the loss of her husband and young daughter the year before in a gruesome auto accident. It's supposed to a simple expedition into a cave that's tourist friendly; but Juno, the leader of the group, has instead taken them to an unexplored cave for the risk element. Of course, the group doesn't find this out until a cave-in traps them and they begin to realize that there might not be another way out. The notch is raised again when one of ladies breaks her leg in a fall, making the search for another exit that much more difficult. With a limited number of flares and no extra batteries for the lights on their helmets, this would've been a great survival story as it was. But, no, the notch has to be raised again to keep the audience from being bored, and we're eventually introduced to the Crawlers, which are creatures from your worse nightmare. The Crawlers use sound to detect movement, and boy are these creatures hungry for some fresh meat. They begin picking off each of the ladies one by one. The thing is these are tough ladies, especially Sarah and Juno. These women aren't going down without a fight to the finish no matter how scared they are. In one scene, Juno takes on four creatures with a large ice pick and kills all of them. I wouldn't want her mad at me. The question, of course, is who will survive and who will die by the time the movie ends. This is where I got a little confused because the ending isn't what you think it is. There's still another twist to be had to leave you even more drained than you already are.The Descent is definitely one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It's an emotional, adrenaline-filled, roller-coaster ride that will leave you breathless and wanting more. I have to say that the characters were totally believable and had me caring about them from the beginning. I'm not familiar with any of the actresses, but they certainly did an excellent job with their performances, especially Shauna MacDonald as Sarah and Natalie Mendoza as Juno. The Crawlers were absolutely terrifying and gave me nightmares when I went to bed. I kept expecting one of them to hop on my bed during the middle of the night and to pull me out from underneath the covers. This was the first time that I'd seen anything by director, Neil Marshall, and I was really impressed with the quality of his work. I'm now a big fan of his and can't wait for his next picture to come out. The photography and stage design were so good that I thought the entire movie had actually been shot in a cave. I kept wondering how they were able to get all the cameras and lighting equipment down into these little, tiny tunnels. The movie was just perfect on so many levels. It certainly accomplished what the director set out to do which was to make a small, quality film that would scare the **** out of its audience. The extras include a behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the movie, which runs about forty minutes, deleted and extended scenes, an interview with Neil Marshall, and two movie commentaries with the director, crew and cast. I'm now getting ready to watch it again, but this time with the commentary. Highly recommended to those who love good scares!",

A freak accident leaves her husband and daughter dead, and Sarah traumatized beyond anything she believe she can survive. What she needs is to take her mind off the tragedy and get back to what she loves. So, with her friend Beth, she travels to the US to meet up with 4 American friends, led by the fearless Juno, deep into the Appalachian Mountains Juno has promised them a level 2 adventure; nothing too trying. But where she takes the unsuspecting party is an entirely different sort of cave, a cave never before explored. But this cave has more than bats and narrow precipices to challenge the climbers. There is an entirely new species of humanoids living below the ground, and their home has been disturbed.The Descent is interesting on several fronts. It is a new sort of eco-horror film. Go where you should not go, fail to leave the land untouched, and it will fight back. It shows us a parallel line of evolution, humans that went below ground and took a different path than us. But it is also a classic kill-them-one-by-one film, where those who make mistakes are marked for death. Add to that a film starring entirely women, women strong enough to fight creatures instead of screaming, and you have a very unique combination of themes.",

This movie captures the feel and fear involved in exploring the underground. If I ever do go into another one, I will be watching for the freaky creatures that live within the caves of this movie. These guys(or gals)natually freak me out! The way they look, move, and sound are great. There is plenty of suspense and alot of scary scenes.I was a little \"put-off\" by the ending,which I guess is the prelude to \"Decent II\", which I haven't seen yet. Over all, it's worth renting, or buying. It's a classic !!",

Not only was I still in awe of Neil Marshall's technical skill and the actor's performances and how they worked together to create the most claustrophobic film in existence, but while watching the film, I felt my wife almost unable to breathe or move while viewing it, and her energy enhanced my energy and my immersiveness into the film.The absolute best thing about this film is that it could have easily succeeded in a horror film even without the subterranean cannibals because of the setting of the film and the interaction between the characters in the film. It's one of those rare horror films that perfectly transcends the genre, and when a horror film can do that, it makes it an almost instant classic.I say to not watch this film alone, not just because it is damn scary, but if you do watch it alone, you don't have the energy of the other people around you. Some films you can see by yourself and it doesn't really matter, but THE DESCENT is a film that requires you being in an audience of at least one other person. And make sure that you or the other person has a hand to hold!",

Even better, one of the characters wears an Arcteryx jacket - by far the best adventure gear on the planet (forget Northface or Spyder - overpriced garbage)! HOWEVER, while the movie is great, the Blu-Ray transfer is not so. I owned the original (SD) version, then bought HD because I'm a Blu-Ray junkie, only to be highly disappointed. Lots of noise in the video transfer, far too much in fact for a movie only recently created.

These characters balance gritty and vulnerable so well.

    "review/text": "5 Stars = MasterpieceFew horror movies, if any, in the last ten years match the intensity, suspense, dread, action, acting, direction, character study, & just the up in your face horror of \"The Descent!\"A group of women descend in to a cave that is supposed to be already explored, at least that is what they all think, except Juno, who has actually taken them to a uncharted cave system. Juno wants them to be the first to explore it. So our story starts, after a prologue of Sarah, Juno's best friend (or should I say, biggest guilt?) loses her husband & daughter in a car wreck, & the group of friends meeting each other after a long absence, at a cabin in the woods.If you're claustrophobic, then don't watch this film, as the women crawl, climb, & dig their way in to the cave. In a terrifying scene, Sarah gets stuck in a small passage way. Her friend Beth, crawls back to talk her out of panicking, so she can get Sarah out. As this starts to work & Sarah squirms her way out, the passage starts to collapse on top of her, as Beth urges her to move fast! Hence the cave now becomes a huge looming cavernous maw that swallows them whole, & closes it's mouth. The women are stuck in a giant cave complex, filled with passages, spreading out like veins in a hand, with no idea if there is another way out. A true horror, that is completely plausible!As the women search for a way out, with many a suspenseful scene, the cave becomes more & more ominous. They find ancient drawings from cave dwellers that suggest another entrance (exit) of the cave. It is here that all hell breaks loose, as their stalked by mutant cave dwellers for food, one by one.Not since \"Aliens\" has there been such intense action in a horror film, as the women punch, kick, bludgeon, & stab their way through thrilling scene after scene of survival carnage with the mutants. This is literally savage, & is filmed, acted, & choreographed in such a way that it sucks you in like a giant vortex, right into the action! The mutants make up is totally credible & genuinely scary, especially the female mutant. They look like a cross of humans with bat like features on their head & faces, true subterranean looking creatures, right out of a nightmare!To say much more about the story, would be giving to much away. I will say this, the film is a experience! An experience in terrifying claustrophobic horror. One has a hard time figuring out which is more terrifying, the cave & it's hopelessness, or the mutants? Both are a potent combination, & if it were not for the terrific cinematography, make up, ensemble acting, direction, setting, & editing, this film could've of been just another forgettable horror film. Thanks to director Neil Marshall, it's not! For he has created a true masterpiece of the genre, & though there have been similar films, at least in theme of cave creatures, this film stands as a true original masterpiece!The Blu-ray looks & sounds fantastic, if you don't have it, it's time to upgrade!Essential viewing for the horror lover!",

    "review/text": "When I realized this was done by the same director who did \"Dog Soldiers,\" I was not surprised. However, unlike \"Dog Soldiers,\" which is more creepy than scary, \"The Descent\" had me nearly climbing the walls in squirmy terror.Because I am a dunce, I first watched this by myself at night several years ago. (I have no idea what I was thinking.) I didn't realize how truly frightening it would be, and, by the time I did, I HAD to finish it because I needed to know what happened! I watched most of it from inside a blanket, viewing it from a hole in my protective cocoon. I think I held my breath through most of it.It manages to build characters and situations that are believable and real (even exploring the depths of female friendship and loyalty), making you care about these women. When you watch it, it doesn't feel like a soulless Hollywood film that's just gratuitously gory and bloody with a plot thrown in because there needs to be one. It's raw, engaging, and real--you can believe it really is a vacation for six women that went horribly wrong.True to what seems to be the nature of Neil Marshall's brilliance when it comes to suspenseful horror, this movie manages to not actually show you what's terrifying until more than halfway through the movie, yet keeps you engaged and on the edge of your seat by merely... suggesting... what might be terrifying.My husband, an avid horror connoisseur, actually jumped at The Scene (I'm sure everyone knows what scene this is without me having to describe it!) and squirmed through the rest of it, and I have never seen him jump or squirm at any movie before.All that said, and I hate to say it, this movie was not perfect to me. I docked a star for the ending, which was the only part that disappointed me--it was lame. This is because I am not a fan of endings that aren't endings. It's one thing to leave a movie open for a sequel, which is annoying but forgivable; it's another to just leave it to interpretation, as if you got tired of it all by then, so you quickly finished it without actually ending the story.",

    "review/text": "Bored on a Saturday night, my friend and I ventured into this film only knowing it was a horror film and nothing else. What we fell into was one of the most frightening, thrilling horror films we had ever seen.And not horror in the classic blood and guts theme, although this movie has its fair share. This movie plays on you psychologically until you find yourself watching it with great unease, gripping your friend as you straddle the edge of your seat.This movie will make you understand what claustrophobia is all about. You will curse that damned cave for an hour straight, and when things start to really hit the fan, your heart will race for the remaining 40.Why is this movie clever? It presents an interesting study of human nature. When you are caught in a life-or-death situation, how long does it take before people lose all convention of decency, and turn to their primal nature of survival? If you were in a life-or-death situation, would your friends still be your friends - or would they turn on you?The first 15 minutes of the movie shows you a perfect friendship among 6 friends. The remainder of the movie shows a steady digression of that friendship, where the need to survive completely destroys all levels of trust.If you are a horror fan you owe it to yourself to check this under-the-radar film out. And if you aren't a horror fan but can take the gore, you should check it out as well.My friend and I recommended The Descent to ever person we knew when we walked out of the theater that night, and all of our friends have been raving about it since.",

    "review/text": "I can't speak for the U.S. version of this DVD, but here in Canada, the version that Lions Gate put out (distributed through, Maple Pictures) and that's marked on the front case as, \"Original Uncut\", has the original U.K. ending, and not the, watered down U.S. ending.I have procured an early copy (and not just a screener copy) of the Canadian version of this DVD, and checked this out right away.It's also in widescreen with some nice extras, including 2 commentaries, outtakes, deleted and extended scenes, as well as a 40 + minute, behind the scenes.The spoiler below is ONLY intended for people who want to know the differences between the U.K. and U.S. ending, and should NOT be read by anyone else (lest you spoil the movie for yourself).SPOILER: The endings of the US and UK versions differ. In the end, Sarah wakes up at the bottom of the cave, crawls out, and makes her way back to the car. When she is driving away, she pulls over and vomits, and when she leans back into the car, she is startled by the ghost of Juno sitting in the passenger seat. The US version cuts to the credits here. In the UK version, this apparition causes Sarah to wake up for real at the bottom of the cave, revealing her escape to be just a dream. She then has a vision of her daughter's birthday cake, which we see is just her torch. The camera backs out, and the movie ends. This ending was considered \"too dark\" for US audiences.",

    "review/summary": "An effective horror with characters",
    "review/text": "09/03/2008There are over 140 reviews so there's not much I can add in plot summary. I viewed the DVD over 6 months ago but decided to add a few comments and give away a few twists (warning: don't read this review if you want to be surprised).1. The story starts out with the lead character (Sarah), an outdoorsy young, married mother, suffering a horrible family tragedy - I'm not one to \"get over it\" if it happened to me - - the tragedy returns in the finally scene of the DVD unrated director's cut, and it is this closing of the loop that really haunts me, more than the Crawler creatures (which, as far as I know, don't exist).2. Because most of the actors are British/Irish/Scottish, I couldn't pick up all the dialogue. Fast forward a year, and the group of 6 adventurer friends join on an underground cave exploration outing. Unbeknownst to the group, the trip organizer (Juno) selects a cave system that isn't charted. That, in itself, demonstrates the recklessness of the leader and is one of several points of friction.3. To proceed further after roping down, they have to go through a narrow tunnel. I wouldn't crawl under my dusty bed to retrieve a dropped item much less a narrow tunnel dozens of feet underground but it was a situation of \"no guts, no glory\" according to their leader or turn back 10 minutes after starting off. The collapse of the tunnel, the only way in & out they know, is filmed in a claustrophobic manner -- this scene was very effective and gave me an ominous feeling right away.4. Although trapped, they persevere with tense nerves and friction with each other -- blaming and encouraging each other since they know the situation is very untenable. In one scene, one of the characters is overtaken with joy when she thinks there is a way out, and she (recklessly) suffers a broken leg that puts her and the group at even greater loss of hope.5. The antagonist Crawlers, as in most horror movies, are introduced slowly but once shown, they relentlessly attack the group. I'm sure reviewers have a great deal to say about this but the Crawlers are shown to be graphic killers - in the DVD extras, you see the Crawlers are human actors wearing albino suits -- they are not computer generated or added in the editing room. Knowing this, it explains their presentation and in my view, delivers the same scariness as Jurassic Park special effects.6. The movie devotes considerable time to the group's attempt at survival. The characters are smart, athletic & can fight back (not those wimpy, dumb female characters in other horror movies), but distrust and ill feelings set in, and there is a later scene where one character leaves another to the Crawlers to kill so she can flee. The character interactions are as interesting as anything in the movie and sets it apart from others - you actually feel for what they are going through, liking one over another, blaming some, while hoping they all survive but know that some won't make it. During all of this, you get to know something about the women characters, taking sides while watching them fight for survival.7. Well, I wrote that I will give away the final twist so here goes - - in the unrated DVD version (I can't compare it to the US or UK theatrical releases), you think the lead character survives, but she doesn't which is a sad ending in itself -- she imagines seeing her deceased young daughter (died a year earlier) in the final moments as her life is also about to end - perhaps that's better than surviving . . . a very impactful movie in my view.",

The situation do exploring caves and spelunking is unnerving all on it's own, add a few bad decisions by the lady's that puts them in danger and unknown monsters hunting them, your in for a wild and exciting movie. Lots of gore and body count that keeps you on the edge of your seat. the movie keeps on with a frightening pace until the climax.The directing is very good and the underground setting leaves you and short of breath and if your claustrophobic, I wouldn't recommend watching this one.. good ending to a good movie.

    "review/text": "While this film was suspenseful and entertaining, it could have done with a little less gore and a little more backstory. You never get to know the six women very well or understand why they became friends. The subplot where Juno clearly had an affair with Sara's husband before the \"tragic incident\" is never fully explored and could have lent much more tension and depth to the story if it had been.As to what's actually in the cave, that, too, could have been revealed to better advantage and made the film more suspenseful. Truth to tell, the way it was handled, it turned out not to be all that scary. There are a few gotchas, but most were predictable.Many critics have touted the fact that we're dealing with six strong women here, no wimps and no screaming mimi's. While this is true and makes for a refreshing change from the usual horror heroine, it's sad to note that the only way that the writer of this film could write strong women is by having them act like men. I swear one of the scenes had women swilling beer and razzing each other (bonding like men), and all I could think was, \"Miller Time.\" Come on, guys, I KNOW you can do better than that! Some of you need to take a lesson from Joss Whedon.The writing of the ending seemed a little lazy to me, ambiguous in a way that said not so much, \"Now you have to figure out what this means,\" as much as it said, \"It'll look pretty deep if I leave the ending ambiguous. Plus, then I don't really have to figure out what would be an ending that's true to the rather flimsy characters and exciting situation I've set up.\"Still, it was an entertaining ride. One of the film's great strengths is getting the clastrophobic feel of the cave just right. There were moments when I had to reassure myself that the walls weren't closing in as I watched it.Otherwise, don't believe all of the raves you hear about this film. It's a thrill ride, but it ultimately didn't take me anyplace I hadn't been before, and it was pretty frustrating to see an interesting premise ultimately fall flat because of poor writing.",

We have the women friends who are adventure seekers that results in a tragic accident and loss, and then the bonding and healing by seeking adventure again together only a year later (over many beers and idle small talk in a cabin -- perhaps a drunken lesbian love fest would have helped the movie at this juncture -- just kidding, okay, maybe not, because the film is that bad). The girls take due diligence in having all proper equipment for a spelunking trip and then not using it (such as Guide Books, or Ropes that connect one another when going through narrow passages). After taking safety precautions for the trip they drive carelessly and at great speeds over muddy narrow mountain roads that could kill them all at the slightest spin-out (again, this is just the beginning of stupid) to get to their destination. Of course, there are (scary, unexplained -- NOT!) animal carcasses, convenient cave-ins of centuries-old rock formations, equipment loss, classic convenient stupidity leading to injury and death, and feeble attempts at sudden frights, such as Bats shooting out of a rocky crevice (ooooh...scary!) PURE LAMENESS! Add to that, Golum (obviously he found a role for him and his family after LOTR), and his family's thirst for blood underground and the poor \"helpless\" girl victims are there for the taking. On top of it all, the Golum-like creatures are blind, but only conveniently as well when the scene requires them to be blind. UGH!!! I'm guessing the positive reviews here have been written by marketing interns working for the studio or DVD production company. Don't buy the tripe, and don't waste your time.

The entire rest of the movie has absolutely nothing to do with any of it. A movie where the entire first sequence has no purpose, and may as well not have been there, is already off to a bad start...The rest of the movie is just pointless. Things happen exactly as you might imagine: they get attacked by creepy things, etc etc. It ends with a plot twist that is supposed to be dramatic, but actually makes no sense at all, and causes the main character to suddenly seem very, very annoying. The only good scene in the entire action portion of the movie involves the Asian girl pulling some stereotypical karate moves on one of the monsters.The characters are completely forgettable. The plot is boring. There aren't even any inventive gore scenes to amuse the perverts. This movie was probably the worst horror film I've seen in a long time.",

The crawlers were well-designed.***SPOILER ALERT***Unfortunately, the movie did very little to make me empathize with the \"heroine\". Juno had an affair with Sarah's late husband. That was bad. But she was vilified even more for accidentally killing another girl in the insanity of a battle with some of the crawlers, then leaving the girl when she fell to the ground. I'm sorry, but with the wound that she had, I would have expected her to be dead. But, when Sarah wounds Juno and leaves her behind, I lost all interest in seeing the main character survive, which is just as well, since the movie doesn't give us any indication that she escapes the caves. Well, at least until part 2 . . ..",

    "review/text": "I know that I am not alone in saying that all of the sexist slashers(Hostel,etc...) that have been coming out for the last couple of years have been boring and formulaic. They seem to be made for horny male teens that aren't getting any. With that being said, this movie proves that a horror film doesn't need nudity or sex to be great.This film has everything: a great screenplay, acting, and direction. A great horror film should be psychologically scary, and this one delivers. No matter how much gore one puts in a horror film it doesn't mean anything if the screenplay doesn't deliver. It was very refreshing to see a horror film with women as the strong leads, instead of being victims and used for sex.England has always been well known for its horror films from studios such as Hammer and Amicus. It really seems like they are beginning to enter another golden age of horror. This film, along with Dog Soldiers, Shaun Of The Dead and 28 Days Later, have been some of the best horror films to see the light of day in quite a while. Hopefully, American film makers can learn some leasons from watching these great movies.",

I was a little disappointed when it started, but, once it gets going, wow, is this one hell of a trip. Dog Soldiers, the director's earlier horror outing, was a decent enough movie - thrills, action, some nice effects - but hell, has he lifted his game for this one! Cleverly, he's got all the `heroes' as women, only they're not \"screaming at anything that moves, falling down at the first ridiculous opportunity, looking for a guy to rescue them\" women - these are strong women, in an intriguing scenario, who realise the only way out of it, is fighting their way out. Think of Ripley meets Clarice Starling.I'd heard it had received good reviews, but then I've heard that so many times and been disappointed. What a refreshing change it was to find a movie that lived up to the hype.If you like action or horror, or just a rollicking good ride, you really have to see this",

    "review/text": "A group of female friends meet each year for a weekend of outdoor adventuring. After a weekend of white water rafting, one of the women, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) is involved in a tragic car accident. Her husband and son are killed and she is left seriously injured. A year later she gathers together with her friends once again for a weekend of spelunking in the Appalachian Mountains (bringing images of DELIVERANCE and the cabin in EVIL DEAD to mind). Some of her friends want this to be a weekend of healing, some of them are there just for the adventure, and Sarah isn't quite sure why she's along--she wants to be there, yet she's scared, too. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, the leader of this expedition, Juno (Natalie Mendoza), has led the women into an unchartered cave. Passing through a tight tunnel, part of the cave collapses and the truth of what has been going on is revealed. Being trapped in a cave with no option of turning around is horrible enough. But the women aren't the only ones in the cave. Their descent has actually brought them into the lair of a group of semi-human predators who have a particular taste for human flesh. They are blind, but have the ears and reflexes of a bat. The challenge to find the exit then becomes a life or death race to escape from the descent they've lowered themselves into.THE DESCENT uses a lot of typical horror movie techniques, but the film is not a typical horror film. Despite the flesh-eating monsters (who don't even appear on screen until over half-way through) chasing the women and the claustrophobic cave imagery that surrounds them, THE DESCENT is more of an exploration of the psychological and emotional challenges people go through when faced with a life-threatening situation. Taking a cue from Hitchcock, director Neil Marshall knows that the most horrifying things in life are the things we can't see. It is this subtle subtext that gives THE DESCENT an edge. For instance, it is never actually addressed in the film, but Juno might have been having an affair with Sarah's husband and knowing this brings a depth of psychological tension to the situation that makes it far more fascinating than the carnivorous creatures chasing everyone in the cave. Not only that, but Marshall has given us a group of women who aren't like the typical women in horror movies. The women in THE DESCENT aren't frightened little creatures who scream and run away when the going gets tough. Neither are they the idiotic single women of THE GRUDGE or THE RING who seem intelligent but do really dumb things. Instead, the women in this film are women like Ripley in the Alien series; kick-butt, fight back, but fight back smart type of women. They are real women and do things that real women would probably do in such a situation. Nevertheless, this is a horror movie and this film is full of blood and guts. The gore is lessened a bit by the low lighting and economy film making. Nevertheless, there's a lot of blood--think of Sissy Spacek in CARRIE multiplied several times--and therefore the film isn't for the squeamish.I found THE DESCENT to be an enjoyable movie. The beginning moves rather slowly, but is necessary to build the characterization and hinted back-story that gives the film such an emotional and psychological depth later. When I originally saw this film, I was a bit disappointed by the ending. Lionsgate, the U.S. distributor, apparently thought the original ending (the movie was released in 2005 in Europe) was too bleak for American audiences and altered it. I felt that the ending I saw was a complete cop-out and thrown in the please people who have seen too many horror movies that end with the promise of a sequel. I'm glad to say that the DVD version has the original ending intact. There's only a couple more minutes of footage, but those couple minutes change the entire meaning of the film completely. It's a bit ambiguous, too, but it doesn't feel like the cop-out of the original U.S. ending.The DVD includes two audio commentaries, a featurette entitled \"THE DESCENT: Beneath the Scenes\", deleted and extended scenes, outtakes, a short interview with director Neil Marshall explaining the differences in the two endings, some stills, cast and crew biographies, storyboard and scene comparisons, and some trailers for other Lionsgate features. The behind the scenes featurette is enjoyable to watch and the interview with Marshall about the different endings is very interesting. Some of the deleted scenes add some more background to the characters, but the rest were unnecessary to the film's plot and structure.",

    "review/text": "There are a few recipes for survival horror that I've learned over the years. A good survival horror has the following:1) Emotional and psychological conflict. By having some underlying conflict between two characters, we set the stage for a mental or physical breakdown of societal mores. This conflict usually comes to a head under severe stress. For example, in The Thing, the scientists and military personnel have a philosophical dispute on how to conduct their mission. In Predator, Dutch and Dillon have a disagreement as to the nature of their mission. All these issues boil long before a monster shows up.2) A hostile environment. The environment can be anything from the arctic (The Thing), to the ocean (Jaws), to a jungle (Predator). The hostile environment exerts pressure on our protagonists, forcing them together and preventing them from easily escaping.3) A monster. Be it a shapeshifting creature (The Thing), a great white shark (Jaws), or a star spanning alien on safari (Predator), the monster sows discord and divides loyalties by creating an immediate sense of urgency.Stephen King uses all these elements to great effect. But even with all three, authors often screw up the formula by having a weak conflict (if the characters aren't fleshed out enough, who cares if they die?), an environment that's easily escapable (why doesn't anyone ever call for help on their cell phone?), or the monster being cheesy (killer tomatoes? RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!).I'm pleased to report that The Descent hits every note perfectly.Three women, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza), and Beth (Alex Reid), a veritable trio of female empowerment, successfully complete a whitewater-rafting event. The suspicious nature of Juno's relationship with Sarah's husband is subtly portrayed through glances and facial expressions alone. When a car accident kills Sarah's husband and daughter, we have the grounds for a terrific emotional conflict.Fast forward to one year later: our protagonist decides to rejoin her two companions in another bonding experience by going \"caving.\" Three other women join them. We have the sister team of Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and Sam (MyAnna Buring), the older of the two being the more experience spelunker. There's the confident hotshot, Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), who rushes into everything with abandon. And then of course we have our other two characters, the supremely confident Juno and Sarah's friend, Beth, who dreads getting older and seems to have the most common sense of the bunch.Off they go, into the caves. Only it's not just any cave, it's an unexplored cave that's only been recently discovered. The terrain prevents easy ingress or egress and for much of the movie, the foreboding nature of the cave system is as much a danger as the monsters.Eventually, the monsters show up. I won't give away any details other than to say that they are terrible to behold. The arrival of the beasties gives us the final piece of our survival horror movie.The Descent is beautifully shot; director Neil Marshall (he of Dog Soldiers, the best werewolf movie EVER) experiments with different forms of lighting, including red flares, blue phosphorous, green glow sticks, and yellow torches. Flooding and cave-ins are around every corner, and we never forget that our protagonists are stuck in a cave.The characters are equally engaging. Although it's clear from the beginning who will survive to the end, it never feels forced. People die horribly, monsters get their comeuppance, and the conclusion leaves us with the certainty that violence is no way to solve anything.Lord John Whorfin once said that character is \"who you are in the dark.\" We get the answer in Descent. Despite the attractive actresses playing the roles, this movie is literally a descent into the dark recesses of the soul. What they find there ain't pretty.",

    "review/text": "This British low budget horror picture, like 28 Days Later, does something that horror films have not done in a long time, and that is scare the living crap out of the audience. The movie is marketed as \"a movie from the same studio that released Hostel and Saw\" as if it were a bad movie which needed all the helpful marketing it could get. Ironically this film is miles above and beyond the Saw and Hostel franchises, and if anything audiences who hated Saw and Hostel will be turned off from this. It's a real shame though because this film is what horror movies haven't, and should've been, for a long time.The story and plot are well conceived, and it seems that this horrific trip through an unexplored cave system in the mountains can be symbolic of the main character's struggle to overcome the demons of her past. The main character had lost her family in frightening car accident a year before, and has since been having hallucinations revolving around it. Taking it as it is though, the plot revolves around six females who go exploring a cave, when there is a collapse blocking one of the entrances. And so the girls must find another way out. However, disorientation, claustrophobia, and hallucinations begin to set in, making this a terrifying journey.This however is only the beginning. When you just thought it couldn't get freakier, being in a pitch black unknown environment, it appears that the six girls are not alone miles under the Earth, and so this is when the movie turns into an all-out monster movie. The humanoid monsters would scare the living s*** out of anyone who is watching this movie, they move like the zombies from 28 Days Later, and in an environment like a pitch black cave, it's all the more frightening.Stylistically the film uses the same grainy handheld look of 28 Days Later, amping up the disorientation, this combined with the harsh shadows and sharp contrasts of the flashlights used by the characters, creates a look and feel that strongly brings to mind moments from the Alien series. Especially shots where there is a closeup of moisture dripping from the jagged ceiling of the cave. And for anyone who is a fan of the Alien movies, the first shot of the \"crawler\" monster will have you feeling nostalgic.This movie is truly terrifying, as I've said before, something that Hollywood cinema's so-called \"horror\" movies have failed to do for a long time, ever since the MTV Generation of film-makers took over. British horror films seem to still have it, and it seems that they are even reimaging classic horror archetypes into something new and even more scary. Just look at how much more scary the fast-moving zombies of 28 Days Later are in comparison to the sluggish zombies of old. And with this one, look at how the film-maker has managed to take influence from a movie from 1979 and managed to make a film equally horrifying, and fresh-feeling, as opposed to the American tendency to remake old horror movies with little aesthetic merit. The Descent is an exceptional movie.",

I caught the UK ending on another website, and while I prefer that one by far, the U.S. closer wasn't too shabby either. The only thing I didn't really care for were the creatures. They were a little scary at first, but once they started showing swarms of them, they lost that creepy factor. The build up to actually seeing them was so good. I enjoyed the cave diving and crawling parts as much as the creature fest to come. Plus they weren't intimidating and hard to kill like the creature in another film similar to the feel of this one, called Alien.

Natalie Jackson Mendoza (Juno) is beautiful almost to a fault and very gifted. It would be nice to see her in prominent roles in the future.The psychological aspect of the horror in this movie keeps building tension and is intelligently handled, where a lot of things are hinted at but not spelled out for the audience, and the caves and the things that happen inside them are unexpected and disturbing.No doubt about it, this movie does justice to its genre and I daresay that even the seasoned horror fan will be affected by it in some way. It is not a movie that leaves you indifferent to the fate of the characters, and the ending is unapologetic and unrelenting (European version).",

    "review/text": "I'm a pretty recent convert to the horror genre, only coming to enjoy good horror films in the last three to four years. I could care less for films that feature naked teens running around and being slaughtered by the likes of Michael, Jason or Freddy. To me, being scared by the darkness, what you can't see or what you can't explain, is much more frightening! Give me \"The Others\" or \"The Ring\" anyday over Chucky and his ridiculous bride! \"The Descent\" gives you that kind of fear (darkeness and the unknown) and does so on several levels.The story features six action lovin' gals who decided to go cave exploring in the Appalachian Mountains. The alpha female, Juno, is an adrenline junkie and decides, without informing the others, that they will descend into an unexplored cave. Her friend, Sarah, only a year earlier lost her husband and daughter in a terrible car accident and is still battling the emotional demons of that tragedy, perhaps using the trip as a way to move on, trying to distance herself from the pain of loss. Holly, another adventurer, is quite reckless and also prone, like Juno, to a big adrenline rush.Once the women are inside, they are trapped by a rock fall and eventually become aware of underground creatures that see them as a walking meal. The creatures are very creepy and the tight shots of the ladies spelunking and later trying to escape the cave dwellers will tie your stomach in knots. The camera work is great, making you feel the claustrophobic horror that the women are experiencing and giving you only enough light to see the terror that is being inflicted upon them. Add to that trust issues among the friends and personl problems that add to the drama and you have a lot of emotion and fear.The film takes a little while to get into but once in the cave, the suspense builds with each scene. There is a lot of blood and gore, but it isn't overdone and only adds to the shock of what is happening to the team of spelunkers. I'm looking forward to seeing the original ending which was changed for American audiences because it offered a less than positive ending. Even with the American ending, I highly recommend this film to fans of horror movies. I will definitely add this one to my dvd collection!",

    "review/text": "The peaceful life of a reclusive clan of cannibalistic subterranean cave dwellers is shattered forever when their home is invaded by a troop of foul-mouthed women on a mission to convince cinema goers that rude, aggressive, egotistical, profanity spouting twits are the new cool.Horror cliche after horror cliche is evoked as the women, several of whom appear to be high on a toxic cocktail of steroids, PCP and testosterone supplements, make several elementary caving mistakes (my favourite was the one deciding to go running through a dark tunnel she's never explored at full speed) then go all Lord of the Flies on the cave's inhabitants and each other, with ample servings of pointless gore.The movie has no atmosphere whatsoever to work off, so relies on jolting the audience from time to time. The only genuinely scary moment that actually made effective use of the claustrophobic cave environment is the one where one of the women gets herself wedged in a narrow tunnel (nevermind that the tunnel collapsing on top of her inexplicably helps her free herself).To add to the fun, the opening 10 minutes or so of the movie has little to do with what happens next, before being arbitrarily evoked towards the end to justify some more gratuitous violence.In the final scenes of the Descent the protagonist detaches herself from any sort of credible plot or character motivation, and a laughable twist is inserted into the final moments of the film with all the aplomb and originality of a derivative grade 2 creative writing exercise.The production values are good, and this comes from Britain, which may be why it got far more attention than it deserves. A nightmare, but for all the wrong reasons.",

    "review/text": "The Descent was one of those movies that had me enjoying it and hating it at the same time. I have to agree with other reviewers that mentioned that for a large portion of the audience (me included) the movie was clunky, full of holes and, in a sense, confusing and jumbled. *I have not watched the director's commentary, as I don't think that should be a requirement for enjoying/undertanding a flick.On to the meat of the review. The movie is basic and I like those. You have a group of women who go spelunking/cave diving, run into trouble, meet up with some mutated human monster thingies and get themselves gobbled up. Pretty good so far.The cave scenes were well shot for the most part, nice and tight and then at times opening up into dark caverns and underground water pools, etc. But the tight scenes really get to us cluastraphobic types. Good.The acting was fair for a flick of this type. It wasn't great by any stretch because of the type of charchters, the actors playing them and the script and direction they had to work with. I didn't find myself caring if they made it or not, or forming any chemistry for the cast, but I didn't really find them annoying either. When they would die I was rather indifferent and never even learned most of their names anyway (that is how little you will care about them). In a word: Disposable.The monsters. I liked them. But they were portrayed horribly. Supposedly they had access to the surface the whole time, but they preferred to stay down there and mutate to the point of losing their eyesite. Um, ok, fine. But they have been thriving down there and no one has run into them before, though one of the actors had heard about this cave and knew where to find it. Ok. In addition, the monsters are supposed to be blind and the senses they do use (maybe sound) to navigate and engage prey seems to come and go. They can navigate the caves perfectly, but they apparently have no sense of feel, no sensation towards warmth or cold, and they can dodge physical attacks pretty well for something with a body that size that can't see.Another problem I had with the cast was their gear. They were well supplied with ice-axes and they apparently were carrying medical gear, climbing gear and rope, but none of them were wearing fingered gloves (some didn't have gloves at all)? In addition, they didn't have extra batteries or lamps/lights, but they did have flares. And no knives and only one lighter. They had quite a collection of gear (I don't know how they were carrying it because you couldn't see them carrying much) but they didn't have the stuff I would have thought common to spelunkers. But I haven't done that professionally.The combat scenes with the monsters were jumbled. The cast fluctuates from being quite proficient at defending themselves one moment and then being the helpless victim the next.Ok, now I'm going to make an assumption here, because it helps explain away some of the holes I had at the end of the film. The title, descent, could be indicative of two things: 1) the descent into the cave, 2) the descent into madness by the main charachter. For me, that helped bring some cohesion to the movie, as I was originally struggling to find what the beginning sequence had to do with the rest of the movie.Hmmm...so I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think it was a good movie, I don't think it was well thought out, well-acted or well put together.",

    "review/text": "In a wonderful departure from the \"ten little indians\" schemata of previous horror films where the man is strong and the woman survives by luck, here we get an entire movie about just women forced to survive against evil. There are no women running around in towels or their underwear, no women needing to be rescued by a man; these women are tough and that's part of what makes this movie so engrossing.Set for no real reason in the Appalachian Mountains (was this some subversive move on the part of the writer/director as a commentary on contemporary US relations with Europe as most of the women are European?), this is a great tale that takes its time developing and delivers a great payoff. Hold onto your seats in the final half hour as things get very nasty very quickly. I have never been a fan of violence against women, such as in the recent remake of \"The Hills Have Eyes\" (which included a nasty rape), but I could handle it in \"The Descent\" because the women fight, and they fight hard and are not hapless victims. How often do we get to see that? Like - never.Great movie, but not for the claustrophobic. You'll become so involved with the movie that you'll feel like you're in the caverns with the women and it's not always a comfortable fit.",

One morning he wakes up to discover he has purchased the services of a beautiful Chinese housekeeper, Shu-Jen (played by the celebrated Asian actress Li Li Hua in one of her rare American film appearances).This is one of the better films produced by Frank Borzage around this period. Just like the similarly-themed \"Sayonara\" and \"The World of Suzie Wong\", CHINA DOLL explores the problems and prejudices involved in a cross-cultural relationship.Victor Mature is fine playing Captain Brandon; but it's Li Li Hua who really owns this picture. She only made a handful of movies in America, but here she is truly magnificent. The cast also includes Ward Bond, Bob Mathias, Johnny Desmond and Elaine Devry.It's great to see CHINA DOLL finally on DVD. The disc offers no extras but the anamorphic transfer looks a treat.

I saw him once many years ago in New Orleans and recognized him instantly. He fits this part perfectly as it is an older rather jaded character boozing his way through his spare time in a war zone. I was not impressed with the beauty of the Chinese girl and she was waaaaaay too made up, hair too Americanized, but she did a very good job in the role. For a while it seemed like they were playing it mostly for humor then the story turned and it became all drama. For a movie about that time made during that time I thought it was well done.

    "review/text": "This 1958 film directed by Frank Borzage was set in China during World War II. \"Captain Cliff Brandon\" (Victor Mature), drinking away his tour as a Hump Pilot, takes in \"Shu-Jen\" (played by the Hong Kong film star Lihua Li) as his housekeeper. A gruff and distant relationship becomes affectionate; love follows; the two marry and have a daughter; and then the Japanese attack.The film can be appreciated from a number of angles.-- Intercultural marriage. American moviegoers were offered \"Sayonara\" in 1957, \"South Pacific\" and \"China Doll\" in 1958, and \"Bridge to the Sun\" in 1961. The treatments now show their age, but the different plots and characters were addressing interracial marriage, perhaps in response to the small but growing number of GIs returned from Japan and Korea with wives. These films, even though they were about white-Asian marriages, should be recognized for denting interracial taboos, laying important psychological foundations for the Civil Rights movement a few years later.-- War film. \"China Doll\" gave more visibility to the American aviators in the China-Burma-India theatre. Spliced into the film are great scenes, originally shot by combat cameramen, of troop carrier aircraft dropping supplies to the American and Chinese troops crossing Burma.-- Aviation movie: There are some fine scenes of the C-47 and the equipment and uniforms used during the war. Inexplicably, the film editors who put together the other flying sequences must have had hangovers, and aviation buffs will no doubt wince at the several editing whoppers.Finally, if you happen to watch the film with Chinese friends, be prepared to hear them laugh out loud at the Hollywood characters' attempts to speak lines in Chinese. Ward Bond had many virtues, but Mandarin dialog was not one. On the other hand, they will nod in appreciation when Bond, playing a missionary, \"Father Cairns,\" says, speaking of 1943, \"I know China's somewhat behind the times, but you give her time and she'll catch up.\"-30-",

    "review/text": "If THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF PUSS 'N BOOTS was theatrically released in today's era, it probably wouldn't hold a candle to any of America's other animated features and disappear without a trace. But this is a Japanese Anime, and, in its native land, it was a huge box office success. Titled as \"Nagagutsu o Haita Neko\", the production was released in 1969, and the title character, Puss 'N Boots himself, named Perro (or Perrault), became a mascot character for the animation studio, Toei. An interesting fact about this film is that Anime pioneer Hayao Miyazaki is credited as one of the animators -- in fact, he was responsible for the key animation of the climactic, hang-on-to-the-edge-of-your-seat finale. Fans of Miyazaki's work will notice how similar it is to the climax of THE CASTLE OF CAGLIOSTRO.Compared to today's standards, the animation is poor, but at the same time interesting to look at. The entire story is expanded, altered, and spiced up similar to a Disney treatment of a classic fairy tale, but its artistic style is somewhere between a Hanna-Barbera or a Warner Bros. cartoon. This almost sounds like a drawback, but it provides for some silly, funny, and occasionally slapstick moments. It also feels perfect for this kind of movie, even if at times it screams Disney. (Not that I think of it as a bad thing; I'm rather fond of Disney movies even to this day. ^_^)Don't expect a faithful retelling of the classic fairy tale PUSS 'N BOOTS -- this adaptation adds -- and sometimes embellishes -- a lot of cute, funny elements which make it a lot of fun. The hero, Perro, a cat musketeer pursued by three chief-of-police felines (he committed the ultimate \"crime\" of saving a mouse's life), befriends a young miller, Pierre; soon the two are off to seek their fortune. With clever scheming (and a lot of tall \"tail\"-telling) the cat manages to help Pierre pose as the Prince of Carabas in order to woo the lovely Princess Rosa. But the wicked ogre, Lucifer, also wants Rosa, and kidnaps her on the night of the full moon. Perro and Pierre set off to Lucifer's creepy, macabre castle to save her and outsmart her captor. Given that this is a fairy-tale, the ending is very predictable -- yet watching it unfold is only half the fun. Instead of just simply killing Lucifer off by having Perro pull the \"trick him into changing into something edible\" trick, the script (written by Hisashi Inoue and Morihisa Yamamoto) extends the climax into a series of chases, slapstick gags, and, as mentioned, a final confrontation scene which is breathtaking to watch, even if the artwork is dated. (Incidentally, director Kimio Yabuki was also responsible for another fairy-tale Anime, the little-known SWAN LAKE.)I understand that there are Disney haters in the world, and will probably look for things to complain about this loose retelling; particularly the comic mice sidekicks and four incidental musical numbers. But there are others (like me) who won't mind at all -- especially if they're fans of Disney and their adaptations of fairy tales. The mice provide a lot of humor, and, although the lyrics in the English version sound awkward and uninspired, the songs never feel intrusive and are fun to bounce to. (The only exception is Princess Rosa's number, which is as slow and as lovely [but not sappy] as any romantic ballad.)THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF PUSS 'N BOOTS was given a limited U.S. release to the Saturday-morning kids' market, along with other productions Toei produced, including JACK AND THE WITCH and TREASURE ISLAND. The English dubbing was produced by Titan Productions, Inc., with direction by Fred Ladd. Available from HI-TOPS VIDEO (where I first saw the movie) as well as MEDIA VIDEO and VESTRON VIDEO, the voice acting is very lively, but there are problems. For one thing, the voices, with the exception of Princess Rosa, all sound like they're being acted by one actor. (And Perro sounds, oddly, like Al Jolson.) In other words, it's not very high quality. The words don't always fit the mouth movements well, and some lines occasionally come off as stilted and a little too fast. Such flaws are probably best to be expected, since this is an early dub -- recent English track productions have far outclassed past efforts. Still, considering that this is probably the only dub of the film available in English (and that the Japanese language track has not been around in the U.S.), it's not so bad -- unless you count the occasionally sloppy lyrics in the songs and Perro's sometimes grating voice.Unfortunately, the movie may be hard to find -- since its 1988 issue, the video has fallen badly out of print and I have heard no news of any new U.S. company planning to give it a second release. Let's hope it does happen someday. THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF PUSS 'N BOOTS may be a dated Anime when compared to more recent efforts (and U.S. folks probably may consider it too \"cartoony\" for their tastes). Nevertheless, it is 80 minutes of fun, laughs, and action, and a must-see for longtime history buffs, especially if they're interested in seeing traces of Miyazaki's earlier years as an animator before he became a big name. It is a great \"cat's meow\", indeed.",

    "review/summary": "Not So Long Lost Classic",
    "review/text": "American fans of this TOEI animated classic have been waiting a long time to see this early example of Hayao Miyazaki's work on DVD, even longer if they missed its several (at least 3) now long gone VHS releases. What's more, for those of us who remember Fred Ladd's well-done English dubbing that was first shown on American TV so long ago and later released on VHS, Discotek Media has wisely included it as the second audio track. The English audio is a little the worse for wear (though in better shape than the Vestron Video release), and the English credits are unfortunately missing, but unless and until someone wants to pony up the money for a modern re-dubbing, it is better to include it than not because purists can always choose the Japanese audio track with English subtitles.(Parental note: the presumably more recent optional English subtitles, which vary considerably from Fred Ladd's English dub, contain a couple of frequently used exclamations some parents might find a little questionable; suffice it to say that somebody may have forgotten he was subtitling a children's movie.)Miyazaki is listed as a key animator on this extremely loose adaptation of Charles Perrault's \"Le Matre Chat Ou Le Chat Bott&eacute;\", but as usual with Miyazaki his contributions undoubtedly exceeded even his listed credits. A text interview with the director suggests that he did his damnedest to influence character design to the extent that \"his\" version of the title character is said to be noticeably different (\"wilder\") in the action scenes he drew, even in the released version. Then there is the reappearance of so much of Puss 'N Boots in Miyazaki's later work. The wedding inLupin the III: The Castle of Cagliostroand the climactic struggles over the possession of Clarice's ring inLupin the III: The Castle of Cagliostroand Sheeta's necklace inCastle in the Skylook to be clearly based on more comical scenes in Puss 'N Boots, and both the design of Cagliostro's Castle and the pattern of partial collapse of the floating city of Laputa look to be too similar to Lucifer's castle for coincidence. Now there is no question that the animation will seem a little primitive and dated compared to Studio Ghibli's work, but it holds up rather nicely for its age.I hesitate to say too much about the plot because no matter how many versions of Puss 'N Boots you've seen, you've never seen anything like this. It has only marginally more connection to Perrault's Puss 'N Boots than Miyazaki'sCastle in the Skydoes to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, and given how heavily that highway has been traveled, that's a blessing IMHO. Let's just say that this version set in a partly talking animal world includes a back story that reveals Pero, the puss in boots, to be a fugitive from justice from a kingdom of cats under sentence of death for saving a mouse's life; 3 cat assassins on his trail under orders to see Pero dead or \"reformed\" (killing mice again) or forfeit their own lives, who make up in persistence and resilience what they lack in intelligence; a gang of clever mice thieves; 2 scheming brothers; a beautiful princess being forced to marry an all-powerful, magic-wielding devil-king, who is hilariously infatuated with her; a not-the-sharpest-knife-in-the-drawer pauper of a miller's son who becomes increasingly uncomfortable with lying to a princess he is falling in love with; and after the traditional \"ending\" of tricking the bad guy into magically transforming himself into something small and edible fails, a hilarious and deadly game of \"Button, button, who's got the button?\" up, down, and all around Lucifer's crumbling wreck of a castle.Note: This first ever wide screen release restores at least two sight gags spoiled by the pan and scan video releases. This DVD also includes a \"fast play\" feature that plays and replays the movie continuously after just one iteration of the main menu animation; however, as noted above, it defaults to the Japanese version. At least all subsequent replays will be with the language you select if any. Miyazaki fans will find it interesting to compare and contrast \"Puss 'N Boots\" with the laterAnimal Treasure Island(1971), another long lost (until recently) TOEI classic that Miyazaki worked on and Fred Ladd dubbed into English. TOEI produced at least two sequels though Miyazaki had nothing to do with them: \"Ringo Rides West\" andPuss 'N Boots Travels Around The World. Both were released on VHS in the mid-80's, and both are long gone now. Though IMHO inferior to Puss 'N Boots, both are worth a look by fans of classic children's anime, especially the downright surprising Ringo.",

    "review/text": "This movie was actually more delightful than I expected. A bit of it is dated - what do you expect from a movie made in 1969 - but the animation quality of this film was actually better than most of the cartoons that came out in the 80's and 90's in America, and even some of the cartoons today!The human characters were a bit flat. Pierre just takes his brother's abuse, and it appears that Puss does all the thinking for him (which is pretty much the truth in the original story as well) Princess Rose is also flat. She acts helpless and weak, sniveling and crying and then saying 'no!' instead of trying to reason with Lucifer. Lucifer himself was a pretty interesting character, though I didn't understand the deal with his necklace being the source of his power, if he is the Devil himself, as this weakness ultimately led to his demise.The action sequences are beautifully animated, and the animal characters are interesting and fun to watch. You wouldn't know this was an anime from looking at the King or Pierre's brothers, because they're lacking in the wide-eyed anime look that is so common today. Even Pierre and Rose don't look so Japan-ized, but due to the early date of this movie, one can safely assume that this was before anime became what it is today. Overall a very enjoyable movie and one I wouldn't mind watching again, or letting my nephews and nieces watch. 4.5/5 stars for a great and humorous retelling of the Puss in Boots tale.",

It was a bit more fast paced and compacted than the book, which I read less than a week before purchasing and viewing the movie. I have to admit, I am a little biased because I think that Anthony Hopkins is the best actor that ever has been or ever will be. But I truly think that this is one of his best works. Ann-Margaret is cool too, and I enjoyed the lovey parts between them. People on this site seem to want to describe this movie as scary when the only part that I jumped on was when Corky drops the knife at the end, and that was only because the thump it made was so sudden. Otherwise, 'Magic' was a nice, refreshing romance with a twinge of schisophrenic weirdness. But all in all, this rare find was one of the best movies, both that I have seen and that Anthony Hopkins has been in. Great job!!!! I hope to see this movie make it to DVD some time soon!",

    "review/text": "What I first loved about the 1978 film \"Magic\" was the fact the television trailer I saw in the summer of that year caused me to run out of the room. Granted, I was eleven years old, but the creepiness of this alone made me want to know more. I wouldn't find out more until years later when the film was broadcast in an \"edited for television\" version. I liked it then, but love it in its complete form provided on this dvd.As some viewers may have already expressed, \"Magic\" contains one of greatest scenes in all of American film. Not by chance, it occurs between two fantastic actors: a young Anothony Hopkins and Burgess Meredith. In the scene, \"Gang Green\" (Meredith) pays his client Corky (Hopkins) a surprise visit in a country cabin. Green is convinced that Corky has gone insane and presents him what should have been a simple challenge: \"Make Fats (the dummy) shut up for five minutes.\" The tension that follows is unmistakable as we watch the brilliant Hopkins struggle through these seconds. Meanwhile, Green studies his client with a prophetic eye, knowing that his young magician client can't accomplish the task. It's incredibly suspenseful waiting for Corky to crack, because we already know what Green does, and now are just anticipating his reaction. You will likely never forget this scene, and will feel compelled to watch the film repeatedly just because it's there.Of course there are many other delights in this minor horror film, which had the misfortune of being released at almost the same time as John Carpenter's \"Halloween.\" For those of you who enjoy Ann Margret, we get an eyeful of her as well, and Ed Lauter is superb as her suspicious husband. The star of the film is Fats himself, who is charming and creepy all at once. The DVD also contains some nice bonus footage, including the trailer that I previewed as a child.",

    "review/text": "Magic is one of those rare cinematic gems that deserves a wider viewership. The story centers around Corky [played to great effect by Anthony Hopkins] who is shy and self-effacing, and desperate for a break in showbiz. His luck turns around when he comes across a ventriloquists' doll, Fats that is incorporated into his act, bringing him fame and fortune. His agent, Ben Green [Meredith Burgess] gets him a TV stint, but Corky refuses to get a physical 'on principle'. He flees in a panic, and ends up in his hometown, where he stops by a rental cabin that, as it turns out, is owned by Peg [Ann Margret] a girl he had a crush on back in high school. This is where things start to escalate, for the worse, as Fats doesn't 'seem' too happy about Corky's affection for Peg, and acts out in a jealous rage...worse still, matters get complicated when the agent, Ben tracks Corky down, and the appearance of Peg's husband. The movie is held together by the spellbinding performance of Anthony Hopkins. He actually trained for the role, and Fats' voice is all his. The frustrations, and conflicts that Corky goes through is vividly evoked by Hopkins' facial expressions and suitably modulated voice. The supporting characters are equally effective - Ann Margret's Peg & Burgess Meredith's Ben are the most convincing. The effects are more old school, no CGI here - but very effective is conveying a sense of menace in the atmosphere, that there is something darker to the relationship between man and doll. Question is: who is orchestrating whom here? Is Corky being controlled by Fats or the other way around, or is there a supernatural undertone here. You'll have to view this movie to find out, but its worth it. The extras are pretty good too - there is a featurette titled \"Fats and Friends' that traces the history of ventriloquism & the movie. Also included here is an interview with Hopkins. Final verdict - eminently watchable suspense flick with a psychological twist.",

If they aren't still spotlighted by the time you read this minor review by me, then look for them by their dates. They are truly superior reviews.This film is an outstanding achievement in acting by Anthony (The Silence of the Lambs) Hopkins, and directing by the legendary actor and director Sir Richard Attenborough (The Great EscapeandJurassic Parkfor acting andA Passage to IndiaandGandhi) for directing. Of course, both Hopkins and Attenborough are known for their many other works. Additional fine acting is to be seen and enjoyed in Ann-Margret (Viva Las Vegas) and Burgess (Rocky) Meredith's roles. Even the type-casting of Ed (The Longest Yard) Lauter as the heavy is well-played.Of course, without William Goldman's original novel and film adaptation, we wouldn't have this great story and although one can't say that it's original, as we've seen this issue on both the large and small screen before, it is compellingly done here and, again, much credit to the flawless acting by Hopkins who evokes both great sympathy and great dread and the extraordinary directorial skills of Attenborough.This is a minor masterpiece and I wrote about it as I know that it is also fairly much forgotten and deserves recognition.

Turns out people love Fats and, by association, Corky. Certainly Corky must realize people understand Fats and Corky are on and the same, right? Perhaps not, for Corky relies increasingly more on Fats to say and do what he himself could easily do, if only he had the confidence to do so. Fats brings Corky fame and fortune, but we all know money cannot buy happiness. Turns out Corky's fame is just the solution for his childhood romance, Peggy Ann Snow, whose wanderlust has not been satisfied by husband Duke's rooted, staid life. Does loser-turned-celeb Corky have what it takes to sweep the once popular Peggy off her feet and take her away from it all? Anthony Hopkins gives a chilling performance as Corky / Fats, and Burgess Meredith shines, as always, as Corky's agent, Ben Greene. Ann-Margret has some very good moment as Peggy, though ultimately her performance is uneven. Very good film!",

Neuman), and its moveable parts include several minor, accenting \"facial muscles,\" giving the 'persona' of Fats a disturbingly realistic aspect. The supporting players are in excellent form, too. The film has a moody and claustrophobic quality which is perfect for the tale. Attenbourough's direction is top-form as is Kemper's cinematography.

    "review/text": "Corky (Anthony Hopkins) is a failed magician who can still do tricks and finds the secret to his success in a big city night club thanks to being a ventriloquist with a dummy named Fats, his agent Ben Greene (Burgess Merideth) wants him to be on TV as Corky must be required a medical test before he can be on the show. Corky becomes obsessed with Fats especially having chats with him, he's too scared to have the medical test so he runs away for a while to a lake resort in the Catskills owned by the former love of his life Peg (Ann Marget) whom he falls for again, but Fats starts to become evil and wants to take control of Corky so he can kill people and go to the brink of insanity.Highly underrated and unique cult horror thriller from Richard Attenbough and writer William Goldman (\"The Princess Bride\"), the film was a minor hit back in 1978 and gained a cult following. It blends horror with some humor, a superb score by Jerry Goldsmith, and great acting by the cast. The dummy Fats himself is quite a scary little thing for as i remembered back in 1986 when i was 4 watching this movie on video or TV i was terrfied and made me afraid of dummies especially of my brother's dummy but luckily now i'm not afraid of them anymore as much as i was as a kid.This DVD has great picture with sound quality and some good extras like a featurette, interviews, still gallery, trailer, radio spots and TV Spots like the infamous \"Abracabra i Sit on his Knee\" one. This is one of the best psycho and killer doll flicks ever, it's also one of my personal favorite horror movies that i strongly recommend for your horror collection.Also recommended: \"Trilogy of Terror\", \"Child's Play\", \"Sleepaway Camp\", \"Making Contact (a.k.a.

When Ben Green (Burgess Meredith), Corky's agent, mentions that Corky will have to have a medical exam before doing his first television special, Corky flips out and retreats to his childhood home, where he meets up with Peg (Ann-Margaret), a girl he had a crush on in high school. Will Peg be Corky's salvation, or will Fats get jealous?Adapted by William Goldman from his own novel, Magic is a wonderful piece of work that's finally gotten itself a good DVD treatment (including, of course, the infamous television spot). While Attenborough is usually a brilliant director, Magic shows him at the height of his powers. Every shot is perfectly framed, the pace is right on cue at all times, and he pulled incredible performances out of his entire cast. While the film faded into entirely undeserved obscurity, now it's poised to return to its former glory. If you've never had the pleasure of seeing this brilliant film, do so. ****",

    "review/text": "I cannot even begin to tell you how terrified I was of the 1978 film \"Magic\". Actually, I never got around to seeing the film until recently. What scared the blazes out of me were the darn commercials that ran on television when the film played in the theater. In 1978, I would have been seven or eight years old, depending on when the movie came out. No wonder I was scared! Those advertisements for the film surely rank as one of the most effective marketing campaigns in motion picture history. If you have a copy of the DVD, check out the extras' section on the disc. The ads are there, and they're still horrifying. All we see in the television spot is a closeup on Fats, the main character's dummy, as he recites a poem. It's the music playing in the background, and how the dummy says the words and how he looks when he speaks them, that still send shivers down my spine. I ran out of the room with my hands over my ears when I first heard the commercials, and I felt like doing so again recently. Scary. So scary, in fact, that I spent YEARS looking under my bed every night just to make sure that the maniacal little dummy wasn't waiting for me.Now that I can bring myself to watch the movie without screaming over those commercials, it's nice to see \"Magic\" and realize it's an excellent, chilling little film. The protagonist of the story is Corky (Anthony Hopkins), a failed magician looking for the one thing that will launch his star. Early on we get to see the utter horridness of his act. It's bad largely because he's so insecure and hesitant onstage. Flash forward roughly a year and we see that our hero has found the golden ticket to Hollywood. Corky managed to construct a highly entertaining ventriloquist act with his dummy Fats. We see him in action in front of a packed house, and it's like he's a totally different person. Confident, funny, not sweating like Richard Nixon on crank--Corky is ready for the big time. His seasoned agent Ben Greene (Burgess Meredith) thinks his client is ready for bigger and better things, too, but there's a slight problem. The television network wants our man (not the dummy) to take a physical as a precondition for employment. Corky flat out refuses to take the examination, and runs off to his childhood stomping grounds somewhere in the Catskills in order to lie low and clear his head.What's the big deal about taking a physical, anyway? Well, Corky knows he's slipping mentally. He can feel it day by day. His old insecurities never really went away. They actually worsened, and now they manifest themselves through Fats. Call it a split personality. Call it schizophrenia. Whatever the case, our main character is crazy, crazy, CRAZY. He prays the trip will help his condition, and hope seems within reach when he hooks up with his childhood flame Peggy (Ann-Margret). She's in a relatively loveless relationship with the overbearing Duke (Ed Lauter), and is just looking for a way to get out. So is Corky. The two quickly come to the realization that they could run off and live a new life together. Alas, Fats isn't interested in a new life. The dummy wants to remain at the center of Corky's existence, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to win the battle going on in the magician's soul, including committing a series of heinous murders. It soon becomes apparent that no one in Corky's inner circle is safe--including Corky. The situation worsens when Peggy refuses to leave without telling Duke her plans. Too bad her old man isn't around anymore...\"Magic\" is pure magic, a vastly underrated suspense and horror thriller that undeservedly slipped into semi-obscurity for nearly thirty years. The film simply sparkles with creativity, excellent performances, and memorable sequences that stick in your head long after the credits roll. The idea of using a dummy to represent one half of a schizophrenic personality was a stroke of genius. Bolstering this theme are the performances from Anthony Hopkins (amazing) to Burgess Meredith (excellent) to Ann-Margret (also excellent). A great cast always helps make a film great, and \"Magic\" is no exception to that rule. Also giving the movie added vigor are several memorable sequences. I can think of three off the top of head. There's an amazing scene between Meredith and Hopkins where the agent asks Corky to ignore the dummy for just five minutes. The fact that our protagonist can't do it speaks volumes about his deteriorating mental state. Another sequence involving Corky, Peggy, and a deck of cards underscores his condition as well. Finally, when we see the dummy \"manipulating\" Corky instead of the other way around...well...prepare yourself for some serious scares. Thanks go to everyone, from director Richard Attenborough on down, for a job extremely well done.The DVD version of \"Magic,\" brought to us from Dark Sky Films, exceeds expectations. The picture and audio quality look and sound excellent. Extras abound. We get trailers, an old interview with Anthony Hopkins, Ann-Margret make up footage, a still gallery, an interview with cinematographer Victor Kemper (who reveals several intriguing cast changes that make one wonder what the film might have looked like had they went with their initial plans), a lengthy \"Fats and Friends\" documentary, and previews and radio spots for the film. Fats himself even shows up to say a few words. I'm so glad I finally got the opportunity to see this film on disc. I'm also thankful for the opportunity to commiserate with so many other folks my age about those horrific commercials. It's almost therapeutic to learn I wasn't the only one running for the door, hands clamped firmly over my ears and shrieking like a banshee!",

This is the kind of movie that makes you want to look over your shoulder every thirty seconds.I saw it as a young boy and could not sleep that night.

Fats still evokes childish fears and Hopkins is still a master of delivering that kind of unease. It's a lethal combination.Magic is a movie that should be more frequently discussed in horror circles. If you haven't seen it, it's a must. If you saw it years ago, it's worth a second viewing.

I was so scared, I could not leave the bed until my parents arrived back, hours later.I must be honest, ventriloquist dummies still scare me to death. They should totally release the commerical to video or DVD. From what I see, enough people of my age were freaked out about it and would probably LOVE to see it again.",

    "review/text": "The 1978 film Magic is one of Anthony Hopkins earlier movies and, after watching this, it is plain to see why he is the master of doing suspenseful psychological thrillers. Directed by Richard Attenborough, Magic starred Anthony Hopkins, Ann Margaret, Burgess Meredith and David Ogden Stiers. Written by William Goldman, it told the story of 'Corky' Withers who fails at his first attempt at professional magic. Coming back a year later with \"Fats\", Corky does well on the circuit. When his agent tries to sign him for his own TV show, when it is mentioned he has to take a physical- Corky quickly declines and bails out. Yet, the truth is, he doesn't want them to find out that he suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder and he hears \"Fats\" talking to him. Once in the catskills, he meets up with an old flame-Peggy Ann Snow(Ann Margaret) who is in a marriage on the rocks. They both start up a relationship, which leads to the both of them making love & sparks the jealousy of both Fats and Peggy's husband Duke. That's when the fur starts to fly and the story gets even deeper.It's been said that, when the movie's trailer first aired, parents claimed that it gave their children nightmares. The trailer itself featured Fats reciting a poem(Abracadabra, I sit on his knee. Presto, change-o, and now he is me! Hocus Pocus, we take her to bed, Magic is fun...we're dead.\") after which his eyes roll back in his head. It's followed by a cast reading, then Fats opens his eyes and gazes to his left.Siskel and Ebert loved the film and placed it at #9 on their top 10 list of great movies for that year. I, personally, loved the movie myself when it first came out and I still watch it from time to time now.If I had any gripes about the movie, it'd be that Corky and \"Fats\" die at the end. I know that it ties in with what takes place in the book but it would have been cool to see a second film based on the characters. Alas, it wasn't meant to be...which is a real bummer. At any rate, Magic is a great movie. Definitley on my top 10 favorites of all-time.",

The success that his act has brought him starts to push him further into insanity and he runs off to escape with Fats. It is at this point that Corky's weird life begins to fall apart. He finds his long lost love and her violent drunk husband when Fats decides to take over. I remember seeing this movie as a kid and it really scared me.

Just watching as Corky can't go more then five minutes without speaking as fats is sheer genius. Great acting plus a very clever story make for a timeless movie, as is the case in \"Magic\".

    "review/summary": "Tense Character Study",
    "review/text": "This is an overlooked wonderful character study that should hopefully be out on DVD worldwide.A synopsis of the film can be found in many places, but in short, this is a character study of a hapless magician, deftly played by Anthony Hopkins, who hits success when he becomes a ventriliquist with a dummy named \"Fats\", yet Fats may seem more in control...or alive, than one might realize.This movie was a box office and critical flop when it came out, but I believe there are a few reasons why, and why they don't mean anything anymore. First, the film was released at a time when slow character studies were on the wane, and films like Jaws, Star Wars, and Halloween were capturing audiences attention. It also was frought with comparison to two excellent Twilight Zone episodes, Caeser and Me, and The Dummy (one of the series best). But more important, and most significant, is that the teaser trailer to this film was one of the most chilling, riveting previews in cinema history. A simple shot of a dimly lit Fats receiting a little poem, \"Abracadabra I sit on his knee. Presto-Chango, and then he is me...\" People saw this, were scared out of their wits, and expected a tense, thrilling film. Instead they were greeted with a film with a slow opening, and a gradual character study. But while that might sound dull, or drab, I promise you it is not. Once you get into this film Hopkins and Fats are compelling, and the tension at times is very thick and harrowing. It may not have been the horror film people were expecting, but I assure you that Fats would make Chucky pee his pants.Of note: If you purchase this film here, or on eBay, you are very likely to get a full screen (Pan and Scan) film likely lifted at one point from a Betacam version for TV, with no extras, and the terrific teaser trailer absent. The film is still worth watching, certainly, but this film really needs the full treatment on DVD, widescreen, stereo, the teaser trailer, and commentaries by those involved. Maybe even by Hopkins, and Fats!",

    "review/text": "I'm sad to learn from the other reviewers that the only version of the film available is an EP edited version; a bad dub with the language chopped up. Hopefully it'll someday be released un-edited on DVD, but the reviewers here have been wishing for it (and even teasing it) for over 5 years. Doesn't bode well.When I first saw MAGIC on television as a 10-year old boy, I was scared-out-of-my-wits and couldn't sleep... despite not understanding the schizophrenia element. (I thought Fats, the dummy, had REALLY COME TO LIFE and was committing the murders.) Needless to say, I was completely freaked-out about ventriloquist dummies from then on; an abnormal fear that sort of continues to this day, as I near forty.The music is moody and the setting - with its bare trees and murky lake - is melancholic. Add a creepy-looking dummy capable of infinite facial expressions (and filmed like a living actor), and you get this scary and atmospheric film concerning a sympathetic but emotionally unstable ventriloquist and a tragic romance that's sadly doomed to fail. (One of the lovers is married and the other insane.)Anthony Hopkins turns in his usual flawless performance, this time offering us a prelude to his later Hannibal Lecter role. The beautiful and sexy Ann-Margaret is costumed in frumpy shapeless sweaters but is still unavoidably desirable. Here she does great supporting work as a woman trapped in a bad marriage, dreaming of a more magical love - perhaps in the arms of Corky, the fated main character. But of course, we know that's not to be... and it pains us.Lots of creepiness and doom and gloom perhaps, but nonetheless an exceptional film. The acting, the tragic love story, and the mood-appropriate cinematography combine for an A-minus movie.",

One of the things I remember about it most, besides, spooky Fats, the dummy, was the haunting and eerie cords played on a \"squeeze box\" over and over throughout the movie, just two chords. They played when something creepy was about to happen, or had just happened. Hopkins was great as a type of stalker, psycho, who used Fats as a prop, Burgess Meridith was great as his manager and Ann Margaret was excellent in this dramatic and slightly kookie role.",

A young Anthony Hopkins stars as ventriloquist/magician Corky, an obviously disturbed man who begins to show signs of a mental breakdown when he can't seem to function without Fats, his dummy, by his side. As he escapes the pressure by going back to his hometown and reuniting with the love of his life, his condition worsens and tragedy strikes. Hopkins is brilliant, and supported very nicely by Ann-Margret as his old flame; Ed Lauter as her loutish husband and Burgess Meredith as his cantankerous agent/manager.The dummy is quite chilling and the ending leaves a startling impression.",

This is one of the most intelligent horror movies I've ever seen, because Fats never walks around on his own, when he murders victims, its done by Corky. Corky's obsession with perfection and success ultimately takes over his mind and ability to control himself. Metallica once did a song about this film called &quot;Sad but True,&quot; it sums up the ideology of this film well. I also believe this film's concept may have been based on that one Twilight Zone episode, but I could be mistaken.",

    "review/text": "I will begin by saying that I think most so called horror today is flat out laughable. They usually (though not always) contain overdone rediculous effects, incredibly stupid characters, no story, a high body count of people we never got to know, etc. This movie is A DOSE OF WHAT REAL HORROR IS. The story starts normal enough. (Thus it is plausible.) Anthony Hopkins attempts with success to make a living through magic and the use of a puppet (FATS). All starts well. But soon afterwards, we see that Hopkins does not want to be subjected to a medical exam. Why? We see that much of his repressed feelings are voiced through FATS. Gradually, Hopkins starts to lose control of the repressed feelings that he expresses through his puppet, and the puppet starts 'running the show.' (Pardon the cliche.) Eventually, Hopkins repressed side through his puppet causes him to commit murder. This movie literally slams most 'so called' horror films into the wall. Horror is not from rediculous monsters killing through an even more absurd series of effects. Horror comes from realizing that something is plausible and COULD HAPPEN! Also, since there is not an excess amount of blood, the murder scenes LOOK REAL and are all the more plausible! Also, a FEW bodies THAT WE GOT TO KNOW is infinitely more scary than a huge body count of 'barely knews.' Moving right along, character development is superb. We are lead into feelings for Hopkins, but we still understand that some of his actions are reprehensible. Meredith may have a dirty side, but he also has a really good side that really wants to help Hopkins. We may feel sorry for Margaret, but we probably will not forget that adultery is reprehensible. Margaret's husband has a brutal side, but we are allowed some sympathy for him, and his benevolent side is clear when he tries to save someone who 'may still be alive.' On top of that, the scenery is beautiful and dignified. If you like Anthony Hopkins in this, be sure to see him as the eventual King Richard the Lion Hearted in the phenomenal masterpiece \"The Lion In the Winter.\"",

    "review/summary": "MAGIC Is Fun...!",
    "review/text": "Richard Attenborough's 1978 opus MAGIC is a minor masterpiece of cinematic horror that, while oft overlooked, arguably helped pave the way to the slasher craze of late '70s and early '80s (it was released within a mere month of John Carpenter's now better known HALLOWEEN). Though Attenborough and scripter William Goldman--who adapted from his own identically titled bestseller--play down the grislier slasher aspects of the novel, they do generate genuine psychological terror with the help of an outstanding performance from actor Anthony Hopkins (yes, THAT Anthony Hopkins, who would later leave a bigger mark on horror cinema portraying another fictional loon, the infamous Hannibal Lecter). Excellent supporting performances from Ann-Margaret, as Hopkins' love interest, and Burgess Meredeth add to the believability and, in turn, the scare factor of this delightful genre gem.Hopkins portrays Corky Withers, a painfully shy but talented magician who overcomes his stage fright and ignites a meteoric rise to fame when he takes on a sidekick--an extroverted and bawdy ventriloquist's dummy he names Fats. As Corky's act becomes more and more popular and draws the attention of big-time agents and Hollywood brass, introverted and insecure Corky allows the artificial Fats personality to take control. And Fats will do anything--ANYTHING!--to help Corky keep his split personality a secret.True, the plot of MAGIC is not totally original. Not only had a few cinema offerings already told the same basic story--1929's THE GREAT GABBO and a segment of the 1945 British anthology DEAD OF NIGHT, to name a few--but TV's ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS (in an episode entitled \"The Glass Eye\") and THE TWILIGHT ZONE (in a segment called \"The Dummy\") also featured startlingly similar subject matter. Still, MAGIC has two things going for it that make it rise way above the miasmic story line--the superb dramatic (and, surprisingly, ventriloquistic) talents of Anthony Hopkins, and a scene featuring the eye-poppingly gorgeous bare [...] of the beautiful and talented Ann-Margaret. Seriously, though, the performances in MAGIC, especially that from Hopkins, make the worn plot seem compelling and fresh--not that Ann-Margaret's naked [...]don't add a certain allure--and fans of the horror and thriller genres who haven't seen the film already should definitely seek it out.Fortunately, the new DVD release of MAGIC from Dark Sky Films makes it easier than ever for genre fans to see this cinematic jewel. Not only does the disc offer a pristine widescreen digital transfer made from original 35mm negatives, it also offers some pretty cool bonus material. Included are a featurette in which ventriloquist Dennis Alwood, who was a consultant on the film, discusses the challenges in creating the Fats dummy and in tutoring Anthony Hopkins in the art of ventriloquism; interviews with Mr. Hopkins; TV and radio spots in both English and Spanish; and much more.In short, 1978's MAGIC is a great horror flick that, unfortunately, has been eclipsed by other more sensationalized genre films from the same era. But thanks to the folks at Dark Sky Films, horror fans can now see a near-perfect copy of this wonderful film, and serious genre fans will definitely want to add the DVD to their collections.",

But Corky's agent (Burgess Merideth) worries that Corky thinks Fats is real, thus setting off a deadly chain of events.Anthony Hopkins is utterly convincing as the fearful and hallucinating ventriloquist. His manic performance is dynamite; he will break your heart and send chills up your spine. Ann-Margret is good as the cheerleader turned haus frau, but doesn't look dowdy enough. Ed Lauter gives an excellent performance as her brutish husband. Burgess Meredith plays the sophisticated and worldly agent with regal aplomb and almost steals the show.William Goldman's script is thrilling without resorting to gore, and the soundtrack, which is often simply a discordant harmonica solo, adds to the spookiness. I thoroughly recommend \"Magic\" to fans of Anthony Hopkins and psychological thrillers; you will not be disappointed.",

Each succesive airing made me run as far from the TV as possible. In recent years I collected the nerve to rent the film on VHS, hoping for some kind of reckoning with 'Fats'... but the mood of the film was bland compared to my intensely frightened memories. Now, at last, the film with all the press material, including that startling TV spot is available on DVD. My heart thumped in my chest as I brought home this DVD and explained to my roommates the significance of what they would soon watch with me. I made them leave the room as I cued up the spot, turned off the lights and asked them to be seated. I started the commercial and watched both of my 30+ roommates freeze. I confronted that harshly lit face and did not look away. I studied every detail. As a 33 year old man, I'm still afraid of the 'Dummy Commerical'.",

What I remember most about this film was Corky, the ventriloquist going slowly insane, due to schizophrenia, and romancing his childhood sweetheart, Peggy Ann Snow. The love scene between Anthony Hopkins and Ann-Margret was passionate and beautiful, if not a bit steamy. Nevertheless, the scene was executed well and came out right. Some of the more frightening moments in the film were also executed well. Corky using Fats to kill his agent and Peggy's husband are fine examples. As was Corky going completely insane in the end. I, too, remember the commercial for the film, and it did not bother me as much. Magic was a very good film. The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith was really ominous and haunting. It would be great to see Anthony Hopkins and Ann-Margret work in another film together.",

    "review/text": "This review has nothing to do with the above pictured videotape edition of this film. If the other reviews are to be believed (and I see no reason why they shouldn't) this tape contains a cut version of \"Magic\" which I must nay-say on general principle. And now back to Matt's life:I first saw this movie at about the age of six or seven when it premiered on network television. Of course I'd already been intrigued and frightened near to death by the super-creepy t.v. spot that ran in 1978 (kudos to other reviewers here for reminding me of that little gem after twenty-some years). While the film in no way dissuaged my intent on becoming a professional magician and ventriloquist, it did spook me pretty good. Now, after over a decade, I finally decided to revisit the past.While the film certainly isn't great, it is nowhere near as bad as some people would have you believe. It also does not approach the level of banality to which Mr. Hopkins has, in recent years, apparently resigned himself. While I have never been old Tony's biggest booster, I think a case can be made for his performance here. If nothing else, the role is the perfect showcase for his acting style and those who go into the film loving him will only love him more. Ann-Margret does a good turn as Peggy-Ann Snow and Burgess Meredith trots out his usually excellent curmudgeon bit. While the whole dummy/ventriloquist personality swap is nothing new to the genre (\"Dead of Night\" as well as a Twilight Zone episode starring Cliff Robertson come to mind as but two forerunners), this film is nonetheless dark, bleak, menacing, creepy, powerful and very scary. It's not perfect. The love scene between Ann and Tony is even yuckier today than it was when I was five. It is, however, worth a good deal more attention than it has been alotted in recent years. I'm praying for a DVD with the t.v. spot to hit the shelves very soon.Some interesting points to watch out for:*William Goldman's dialogue is just as fast paced and witty as anything David Mamet has ever written and really shows his chops as a screenwriter.*David Ogden Stiers (whose presence pretty much guarantees watchability in any scene he happens to be in, though here he is only in three).*Ed Lauter (if you don't know the name you surely know the face. Rent \"True Romance\" or, if you're into bad movies, \"Death Wish 3.\" The guy plays the same hard ass over and over, but does it better than anybody.)*Check out how closely Corky's face resembles Fats in the scene where he waits for Peg to pick up the wooden heart. Probably the scariest shot in the film.*The scene where Ben challenges Corky to keep Fats quiet for five minutes is undoubtedly brilliant, but is closely followed by the scene where Fats really exercises his control. Corky screams with a migraine then crawls around on the floor on his hands and knees in a sicko-psycho-Simon-Says game with the dummy.*Peg's closing line is, I think, supposed to be her own ventriloquist character voice. I always thought it was a dubbing flaw, but now I don't believe so. It's a very weird way to cap the film.*Check out how Corky's entrance in the final scene with Fats mirrors his entrance in the opening scene with Merlin, his ailing mentor. There are several similarities and ironies not the least of which is that in both cases Corky is relating false events of what just happened to him.As I say, not a perfect flick, but hopefully the above list will tickle your fancy enough to give it chance. And if anybody out there knows anyone at Twentieth Century Fox, please exercise some influence and get this puppy on a DVD. Thanks.",

    "review/text": "For some inane reason every time I think about the film Magic (1978), that song `You Can Do Magic\", by the group America, gets stuck in my skull on a continuous replay loop (`You're the one who can put out the fire')...argh...anyway, back to the film, which is based off a novel of the same name by William Goldman (Marathon Man, The Princess Bride), who also provided the screenplay here, directed by actor turned director Richard Attenborough (A Bridge Too Far, Gandhi), and stars Anthony Hopkins (A Bridge Too Far, The Elephant Man, The Silence of the Lambs). Also appearing is Ann Margret (Carnal Knowledge), Ed Lauter (The Longest Yard), and the late, great, perpetually crusty Burgess `Buzz' Meredith (Rocky, Clash of the Titans, Grumpy Old Men), who's always been one of my favorite actors ever since I saw him on the old Batman movie as the villain character The Penguin (\"How was I to know they'd have a can of shark repellent Bat-spray handy?\").As the film begins we see a painfully nebbish magician named Corky (Hopkins) bombing miserably on stage during a club's amateur night appearance (no stage presence + an indifferent audience = lots of flop sweat). Afterwards Corky, who suffers greatly from an overwhelming sense of insecurity, gets a piece of advice from his ailing mentor in that he needs something to draw the audience in, that being charm. A year passes and Corky's playing the same club, but this time it's a packed house...seems Corky's found his charm in the form of a foul mouthed, smart aleck, extroverted ventriloquist dummy named Fats, who is a really creepy, exaggerated caricature of Corky himself (they even wear the same outfits). Anyway, Corky's act proves popular enough for his crusty yet savvy agent Ben Greene (Meredith) to generate interest from a television network, but the mounting pressure eventually drives Corky to split town and head home to the Catskills. Upon arriving he makes the rounds (the old homestead, the cemetery, etc.) before renting a funky cabin by a lake, owned by a woman named Peggy (Margret), whom Corky went to high school with so long ago and harbored a serious crush on...seems Peggy is married now, to her high school beau Duke (Lauter), but both are more or less going through the motions as the union has deteriorated significantly over the years. Anyway, Corky schmoozes it up with Peggy real good (you never fully get over those high school crushes) while Duke is away, resulting in a renewed sense of self confidence, but the feeling is short lived once Ben makes the scene and quickly realizes his client has some serious issues...some seriously bad things happen, Duke returns home, and things get progressively worse, all leading up to a monumental meltdown as Corky struggles with the formidable will of his wooden partner.In one of the featurettes included on this DVD a man named Dennis Alwood, who's listed as the `ventriloquial consultant' on the film, provides a number of facts about this feature, some of the more interesting ones being that Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night, Fiddler on the Roof) was the original director attached to the project and Jack Nicholson (Chinatown, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), the original choice for the role of Corky. Well, Jewison dropped out (for whatever reason), as did Nicholson (apparently Jack refused to wear a hairpiece required for the role), and so, eventually Attenborough was hired to direct. The production was still without a male lead, so Attenborough turned to Hopkins (on the stipulation he could provide an American accent), whom he'd previously directed on the film A Bridge Too Far (1977), which, by the way, is an excellent WWII drama worth seeing if you're interested in that sort of thing. Also, Sir Laurence Olivier was in line for the role of Ben Greene, but due to illness he had to pull out, and so the role went to Burgess Meredith. Given these various elements one can't help but wonder how different the film might have been had the principle cast and crew remained in place, but know, despite the changes, this turned out to be an exceptionally creepy and entertaining thriller with some truly horrific sequences. Hopkins is amazing, not only in his role but also in his slight of hand abilities. I don't know if these were skills he'd previously possessed or if they were developed during the course of filming, but they add immeasurably to the credibility of his character. The other standout for me was Burgess Meredith, who played Ben Greene, Corky's agent. Meredith was one of those performers who, while in character, made you believe without a doubt he was truly the character he was playing. Such is the case here as was true in Rocky (1976), which he played the lead character's tough as nails manager. The best scene, for me at least, was when Corky was arguing with Fats in the cabin, as Corky was falling for Peggy. As the two are going back and forth, Corky notices Ben standing at the door and two things happen...Ben realizes there's something seriously wrong with Corky, and Corky feels the fear that comes from exposure of his dual personalities. Both result in a very creepy scene as Corky tries to convince Ben it was all part of a rehearsal for his act, but Ben, along with the audience, knows better. The overall intensity builds significantly after this as Corky becomes unglued and subsequently subjugated to the more powerful will. As truly frightening as I thought this film was, I only wish I could have seen it when I was a lot younger, as I'm sure it would have resulted in some really funky nightmares, given the level of psychotic energy that comes off the screen. If you're looking for an exceptionally intelligent, unnerving cinematic experience I'd highly recommend this one as it comes through with the psychological chills. The build up is slow, but the payoff is rewarding, and where else would you get to see a half nekkid Ann Margret? Homina, homina...This Dark Sky Films DVD release features an excellent anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) picture along with a solid Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio track. There's a number of interesting extras on the disc including an entertaining featurette titled Fats and Friends (26:52), which has ventriloquist Dennis Alwood speaking extensively on the history of ventriloquism, along with talking about his experiences working on this film. There's also a twelve-minute interview with Victor J. Kemper, the cinematographer on the film, who also supervised the transfer of the film onto this DVD, a three-minute radio interview with Hopkins, an Ann Margret make-up test (1:18), a gallery containing photos and promotional materials for the film, the original theatrical trailer, four television spots, three radio spots, and English subtitles.Cookieman108",

It's a pity it hasn't been remixed for 5.1 Dolby Digital but its possible the original soundtrack elements may not exist any longer.Additionally, Dark Sky has produced a number of attractive extras for this terrific edition. \"Fats & Friends\" is a nearly 30 minute featurette on the film providing background on the history of ventriloquism and plenty of behind-the-scenes stories. We find out for example that Jack Nicholson was originally going to be cast opposite Laurence Olivier in the film and with a different director (Norman Jewison). \"An Interview with Victor J. Kemper\" the cinematographer on the film features plenty of behind-the-scenes information on the making of the film as well and it runs just over 12 minutes. We also get a vintage radio interview with Anthony Hopkins playing behind bloopers and cut sequences from the film. We get a second interview with Anthony Hopkins as well as Ann-Margret's silent make up tests shot for the movie as well as a photo gallery and the original theatrical trailers two in English and two in Spanish with radio ads. The interactive menu echoes the original chilling commerical that played on TV when the film premiered and is highly inventive and disturbing.",

    "review/text": "Sir Anthony Hopkins performance in this movie was simply amazing. Why haven't they released this movie on DVD yet? I was only 6-years old when this film was released back in 1978 and I will NEVER forget the short, yet effective television commercial that ran briefly for this film (those of you who remember it know what I'm referring to!). It wasn't until I was nearly a teenager when I finally saw 'Magic' for the first time, but even then I didn't have the maturity to really appreciate or understand the psychology behind it all. James Hetfield, lead singer of the band 'Metallica' was so inspired by this film that he wrote a (rather disturbing) song about it called 'Sad But True.' Unfortunately, this film has been out of production in any format for quite some time now, but If you're interested in learning more about the film's content and eerie musical score (that accordian still creeps me out!) you can check out some of the VHS reviews here at Amazon (some of them are a little too revealing though, I think). I can only hope that this buried classic is one day transferred beautifully to DVD. Lets give Sir Anthony Hopkins, Ann Margret, and Burgess Meredith the respect they truly deserve for their performances and release the full, unedited, theatrical version of this film already!",

Being one of the skeptics of this release, being one who has treasured the film, way back from an edited for tv broadcast to the full length Embassy Video on Beta (!) to a laserdisc to a really sorry but beautiful looking vhs of the edited for tv version. I have been probably this films biggest champion. My friend told me this DVD was coming out and passed for fear that this was just another rehashing of the \"Clean\" Edited version. Well I saw what great extra features were on it and I thought Ok. Give it a shot. I was worried because who has ever heard of Dark Sky films? I thought surely 20th Century Fox would have put the proper version.But from the main menu to the Fats and Friends Documentary to the fact that this is the full length 107 uncensored version, I have been in a surreal state of Bliss. Finally having a definitive version of this movie. Even all the posters and lobby cards I collected are here in the photo gallery! The conversation with the Ventriloquist supervisor for the film was excellent. Fats himself even makes a personal appearance in the discussion! Funny stuff guys. Ok go buy it, and yes I do feel that leaving the film's soundtrack in 2.0 was a good decision. If IT ain't broke don't fix it.Thank you Dark Sky films",

For some reason, critics jeered it when it was first released, and it apparently dropped off the face of the earth. As a last resort, I bought this tape, but found the viewing conditions were very bad. It's better than nothing, I guess, but the sex scene was edited and the language dubbed out, just like on television! This particularly hurts the final line of the film, which includes a certain four-letter word. Nonetheless, it's a disturbing and very funny thriller with great performances.

The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel. Anyway, I look forward to receiving it.",

    "review/text": "It may be worth asking whether \"Magic\" is the dismal failure critics have claimed, especially since some of the criticisms fall wide of the mark. We can dismiss, for instance, a critic who maintained that the theme of the film ----- a ventriloquist whose consciousness transfers to a wooden dummy ----- was such a horror clich&eacute; that it made the film a waste of time.That particular criticism is invalid, since few people launch similar complaints about the endless succession of films about vampires, werewolves, and Faustian scientists, or the many films on alien invasions. The above-mentioned critic might retort that these themes are \"archetypal,\" and therefore merit as many variations as audiences might demand. But even that justification is pointless, since the essential theme of \"Magic\" is psychic duality, a theme falling well within the confines of traditional fantasy. In other words, the motif of the ventriloquist-and-his-alter ego, which has shown up in films as varied as \"The Great Gabbo\" (1929), \"Svengali\" (1931), \"Dead of Night\" (1945) and \"Devil Doll\" (1964) is simply another manifestation of the doppelganger theme, which is as much a fixture of the horror genre as any of the other themes mentioned.So that leaves is with the question of treatment, or let's say: \"production values.\"On the acting front, Anthony Hopkins easily steals the show as the bedeviled ventriloquist, while Ann-Margret does a creditable job as his long-lost paramour, displaying a fair amount of \"brains as well as boobs.\" But Burgess Meredith, playing Hopkins's manager, chews some scenery trying to look like a shrewd entrepreneur, to the point where his \"jokes\" fall totally flat (e.g., offering Hopkins a cigar, saying \"Take two, they're big,\" as if he's just served up a gem).This brings us to the shaky script by William Goldman, whose talents seem to have eluded him for the bulk of this film. It's almost impossible to believe that Goldman was the same man who penned the scripts for \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and \"The Stepford Wives,\" both of which were models of cinematic wit. \"Magic,\" by contrast, falls apart almost completely: when we're not enduring the one-liners of Meredith, we're groaning at the ostentatious swearing of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s wooden sidekick. As Meredith says at one point near the beginning of the film, trying to sell his act to a TV executive: \"I've got a ventriloquist teamed with the first X-rated dummy on the block. Eat your heart out.\"Well, we're not exactly eating. Perhaps it's worthwhile, however, in this context, to relate an anecdote from personal experience, to help illustrate why \"Magic\" fails on a rhetorical level.About ten years ago I unknowingly purchased an expurgated edition of \"Magic\" on VHS. Believing I had the original version, I popped it into my VCR, only to discover that all the X-rated words of the dummy had been edited out and replaced by words like \"darn\" and \"heck.\" At first this seemed a good idea, since a lot of the cussing in the original version seemed superfluous. But as the picture moved along I cringed. Every time the dummy opened its mouth and uttered its sanitized lines, it became obvious how sterile the dialogue was in other respects. In other words, it became clear that the X-rated lingo was thrown in for the same reason as the nudging, winking performance of Burgess Meredith, trying to \"impress\" the viewer for all the wrong reasons.This, I think, is the main reason \"Magic\" fails in the long run. Not that it's a bad film in some respects. The performance of Hopkins is brilliant, and the mere appearance of the dummy in many scenes, due to its ability to conjure up some incredibly creepy facial expressions, makes for some scary moments. The music score, for its part, is very effective, especially the \"demonic\" harmonica riffs that seem borrowed, to some extent, from an old Twilight Zone episode called \"Printer's Devil.\" Atmospherically, in other words, the film is suitably dark and eerie in its more somber sequences.But it's the pandering tone of \"Magic\" that ultimately undermines it, almost as if the director, Richard Attenborough, had no real interest in the film and so decided to resort to gimmickry to get its points across. On one level we're intrigued by the theme of a shy, repressed stage-magician whose \"dark side\" gets expressed through his ventriloquized alter ego, and who, during the course of the film, almost gets his girl. But when all the dust settles and the blood dries, we're left with the feeling we've been conned, so that what might have been a forceful dissection of abnormal psychology becomes ---- well, just a very wooden dummy with its guts pulled out.",

Hopkins plays troubled loner Corky, his years of preparation as a slight-of-hand magician thrust back in his face by a drunk and distracted debut audience, who then redirects his efforts into a ventriloquism act with an engagingly demented dummy-sidekick, Fats. The resulting sudden thrust into national fame causes a very real split within Corky, who has given away far too much of his sublimated soul to his wooden partner, and then finds himself totally dominated by his own creation -- who, it turns out, doesn't draw the line at murder when threatened. Ann Margret plays Corky's now world-weary and vulnerable high school infatuation, and Burgess Meredith is the veteran agent who is the only one to recognize the truth about his client: \"Ya ain't in control, kid!\" Side note: Hopkins threw himself totally into his role--all of the ventriloquism and slight-of-hand are his own.",

I have waited years for this movie to come out on DVD to once again experience a movie unlike any i can remember seeing as a child (or any point thereafter, in my life).If you're anything like me and miss the horror of the 70's and 80's, this movie might well be one for your collection, in fact it always bothered me that it never earned a place in the annals of the great horror of that period. And now that i think of it, the movie might better be described as a traumatic drama.The best way i can describe it is if you can imagine Jack Nicholson from The SHINING with a puppet (think for a second of what would gradually ensue). This movie is the sad and gradual plummet regarding a shell of a man tortured by his own inadequacies and just a hint of paranoid schizophrenia. Ill admit there are bizarre moments where one is left to question where the man ends and the puppet begins and which one is really pulling the strings.For those of you not up on horror and are more in line with lets say Batman, if you know the villain Scarface (a pathetic ventriloquist, with a split personality, run by the more dominant criminal personality found in his puppet) Imagine if a movie was made solely on that concept, save for the fact that the puppet isn't so much a criminal mastermind as murderous sociopath.The viewer watches wanting desperately to believe that there is hope for Corky (Sir Anthony Hopkins, which i will quickly add not only gave one of his first cinematic performances in this movie, but arguably one of his best since the LAMBS SERIES) but the viewer is soon left to discover............you know what better i not tell you (this is simply a movie that has to be watched, and i promise if watched with another you will be discussing it for hours).One of the worst parts of growing up is becoming a cynic, losing your innocence and realizing the things you once believed in really aren't for real (i.e. Santa and the tooth fairy). Well for those of you looking to regain a loss piece of your childhood, when this movie comes out in April 2006, (do like i will) rent it or buy it, turn out the lights and watch, you will believe in magic again (i promise you).",

    "review/text": "I really wanted to like this movie. I'd heard about it for years, and being a fan of subtle horror as opposed to thestandard blood and gore crap, I must have unconsciously expectedthat this was a lost gem with the great Anthony Hopkins. It isn't.I haven't often encountered films that are deservedly obscure but this isn't one of them. It is really disappointing to see Hopkins' talent wasted on a one dimensional mess of a character, the schizophrenic Corky, and see that really creepy dummy Fats, and realize what this film could have been if any imagination or effort had been into it.This was undoubtedly a chore for Richard Attenborough. He had rich material, great actors (Ann Margret, the late Burgess Meredith and of course Sir Anthony), and emerged with an unbelievable clunker that at times borders on sheer absurdity.The whole turn of events from the beginning of the film is beyond belief. We first see that Hopkins' character Corky is ashort tempered, quirky man who has aspirations to be a magician. He is laughed out of numerous clubs and booed constantly to his angry dismay. Then just a little later on the film we hear he's been on Johnny Carson. And yet he's still \"scared of success\" and doesn't want to make it big?None of this makes any sense.The \"love affair\" between Ann Margret and Corky is ridiculous. All the sudden Corky, who is certainly no catch, decides to take up residence while hiding from his agent in a cabin structure deep in the woods that just happens to be run by the girl he loved in high school. He behaves like temperamental, freaky jerk and all the sudden Ann Margret falls in love with him and wants to leave her alcoholic husband for him. By the end of the movie he's killed two people and Corky still thinks he can just leave and have a happy life with her.The only remotely effectual part of this movie is the relationship between Corky and Fats, and there are some chilling moments. There are some bone chilling scenes as we see just how insane Corky is, unable to make decisions without Fat's illusory confirmation and constantly being tormented by him. Fats is also amusing, though. He talks like a little mafioso.The ending is sad, true, but not that sad if you look at it logically: Corky has murdered his rich, famous agent and Ann Margret's husband, and I guess there's supposed to be some tragic irony that she wants to run away with him when he's dying in his cabin. So what? He would have been caught anyway and she probably would have noticed at some point that he was a complete schizoid, what with not being able to stay away from Fats for five minutes. Even as a psychological piece this is a little disappointing since nothing is elaborated on. Another reviewer mentioned that this may have been based on the Twilight Zone Episode with Cliff Robertson. If that's the case, watch that instead, as I'd recommend that half hour over this entire film.",

I would rebuy this movie IF it were in 5.1DD here (but it ISN'T), and my gut tells me that the extras (as usual) are just filler not totalling more than 20 min. I bet.Anyway, this movie has been out of circulation for far far too long. There is just a vibe about it. Fats is awesome and Anthony is of course in another dimension when it comes to actors. I must add this movie has the distinction of having my \"all time favorite scene\" in it; it is the scenario which plays out when Greene (Burgess Merideth) walks in on Corky when he is having an arguement with Fats, the ensuing 5 mintues or so of celluloid should be bronzed as an example of how acting is DONE.Now, can I get \"Sybil\" starring Sally Fields??",

Each episode is focused on a different gang, inclusing interviews from current members, former members, aswell as the law enforcement agencys attached to investigating that gang. Definately some parts that may be hard to watch for some people, it is an understatement to say that this contains violence. My only 2 issues with this show is that it was made for people that watch 1 episode at a time, if you plan to sit down and watch a few in a row, you will find it gets repetative. Aswell, the first season is the best one by far, contains all the major gangs, the show kind of goes downhill from there, but thats not to say it gets worse, just not as good as the first season. I grew up in a very gang dominated city and throught i knew a fair ammount about gangs, apparently i was wrong. This series is a definate eye-opener.",

    "review/text": "Gangland: Season Three, brings to light street conflicts im Americancities that is beyond the comprehension of anyone, in a brave andfearless manner that is unmatched elsewhere, beyond the gruesome ofwhat is seen even, in the final moments of Taxi Driver, for example.This series, in no shape, way or form glorifies conflict. Rather, itbuilds on interviews with key individuals who decided that thelifestyle wasn't for them after experiencing it first-hand for alength of time and concerned about it potential as a livelihood inthe medium to long term.In the case of LA GRAN FAMILIA (LGF), based in Atlanta, GA, thefounding of the group was noble at first, opposing variousinjustices and humiliation from school bullies. At some point, thisgoal changed to the pursuit of status, gold chains, glamorous rims,Mercedes Benz cars, hotties, money and the exhilaration ofinstilling fear in others generally, and competing with anddefeating local rival gangs specifically.About 5 years before the opening of the Atlanta Olympics andafterwards - a time during when the demand for manual labor inpublic works projects was high, as well as the remuneration - amassive influx of aliens from Mexico and Central America occurred,increasing it 10 fold locally, and the general population ofeveryone in metro Atlanta doubling as well.Along with a much higher number of wealthy laborers came a muchhigher demand for narcotics and underground services, includingcocaine, meth, ecstasy, marijuana. It also opened the door toextortion and manipulation of those migrants, who by necessityrequired fake ID and a means in escaping from the ICE (Immigrationand Customs Enforcement), such as changing living address regularlyremain untraceable by detectives.With LGT, there are the rivals North Side 14, La Raza and theSurenos. Through a well defined structure, LGT is made up ofMaltides 13, Latin Kings, Brownside Locos, Pachucos 21 andRiverside Locos, all of those present to some degree in Atlanta,Dikalb, Cobb, Gwinett and Hall counties, The only difference is theabsence of clearly defined territories, unlike LA.For those the inhabitants in the vicinity, living in fear is atoken, as residents decline in identifying members to not beingshown as complainants to the law. For those on the outside, tagsseen on the street suggest the presence of various gangs, and an Xan opposition to it, hinting at animosity and imminent conflict.The gang culture is present in other ways as well, through thewearing of tattoos, a large number of drive-by shootings, calledcliquing, (men, women, children), hiring lookouts, pushers, handsignals, kick doors (home invasions, burglaries), car thefts,weapons use (shotgun, pistol, machine guns), luxury cars with bulletproofed windows. All of this increasingly catching the public'sattention, as the ends justify the means, with an increasing greedand viciousness and frequency.The RICO statutes and the FBI are deployed to reign in thoseoperations, bringing members into the fish tank (detention), havingmembers roll over, and sentences decided.",

I have read a lot about him as well as heard from these friends personal stories of this holy man. This movie went far beyond my expectations since most Saint films just \"don't get it.\" I did not find a single error. However, it is only a 4 hour movie and the man lived with the stigmata for 50 years! You cannot possibly portray \"enough\" of his life to satisfy any devotee's appetite. Also, this movie portrays just about the best \"Hollywood\" depiction of a woman possessed by a demon- very real life. (Her head doesn't spin around, she doesn't puke green.) My whole family (kids are 11yrs-22yrs old) enjoyed this film. We rented it on Netflix first and I'm buying it to loan to people and hopefully inspire more friends and neighbors to give their whole selves over to our Loving GOD. St. Padre Pio, help us to trust God fully as you did. Help us to \"Pray, Hope and Don't Worry,\" as you admonished us while you walked this earth with us. Dear father, pray for us.",

No movie has inspired or moved me as profoundly as this account of St. Pio's life. The acting is outstanding; the film is visually stunning, the music is beautiful and the characters are real human beings who attract, repel, evoke sympathy and compassion. Moreover, it offers the viewer deep insights into the true nature of the spiritual life, especially the lifelong battle with personal sin and the Evil Spirit, the role of sacrifice and ultimately, the redemptive act of Christ's Passion in conquering all the enemies of the Christian life and salvation. St. Pio comes alive as a thoroughly human figure who was granted extraordinary graces by God and appropriated them for the good of others. This is a film to be viewed again and again, with much spiritual benefit.",

I understand the movie is already over 3 hours long, so they could not include everything. A nice 5 or 6 hour mini series may be what is needed.

This is nothing new. Most saints suffer these things,alas, everyone suffers temptations. I now have a great devotion to padre Pio which I did not have before, thanks to this film. You will not find hollywood making a film like this. The acting is superb, the chosen actors are perfect for the script, the score is touching and its a very good production. The Italians did a great job. You can place this gem next to other gems like 'The Song of Bernadette', A Man For all Seasons, 'El Cid' and others. I have bought copies of this dvd for my Catholic friends and they've loved it.

    "review/text": "This is a terrible movie, both from a religious and artistic point of view.From an artistic point of view, it is often incoherent, the plot line jumbled, the characterisations inconsistent. Also, many things are changed around in the film, that would have been more potent had they retained the details of reality they were denied here.From a religious point of view, the story flat-out lies regarding Saint Pio and events in his life, aspects of his religious beliefs, and comes very close to slander regarding fictional events portrayed in this film. The film portrays his father as confessing to adultery (this can be nothing but fiction, as confessions are sacred and sealed - plus, his father and mother were very devout and saintly and devoted to one another), and it portrays Saint Pio as having some sort of romantic obsession with one of his spiritual children. Nothing of these sorts took place. Ever!From an artistic point of view, the device of an elderly priest harassing Saint Pio on his deathbed is almost humorously clumsy and facile. I could not laugh, however; because this is also another untruth. No such person visited Saint Pio.From a religious point of view, I also found this story device distressing. The film strongly implies this man is the devil or one of his emissaries - and yet, Saint Pio begs him to hear his confession. This would not happen. Saint Pio literally battled satan daily, and the devil never won. And yet, in THIS film, Saint Pio is portrayed as wailing, \"Why does he (the devil) always win?\". Sacrilege.I wish I had my money back. I wish I had the two hours of my life back which were spent watching this lying, clunky, ambling trash bin of a film. The filmmakers clearly have an agenda against religion, shown at every opportunity - lecherous priests, money grubbing religious, etc. My skin felt like it was crawling, watching this (and yet I felt I must, to be truly fair in my summation). They portray Saint Pio as an athlete bounding up stairs even in old age - in reality he slowly shuffled due to his stigmata wounds. Some of their jabs are subtle, others devious (see above examples) and still others are outright slaps in the face - of our dear Saint and of the Church. I felt anger watching it, but most of all sadness, and traces of the evil - some of its lies were so sneaky. If you haven't read every book about Saint Pio you possibly could - you might not know just how badly some of the events of his life are twisted, here.Saint Pio asked his spiritual children not to give him a black eye. This film gives him a black eye. I hope you will not buy it. Please seek out a documentary or a book made by those who loved and knew him, instead. This film did not have the participation of such. Perhaps you should ask yourself why.",

It is the only book I have read about Padre Pio. It was written by Renzo Allegri, who also was involved with this movie.For me personally, I like to know that the actors and people who make movies such as this one are really Christians. I realize some people don't think that matters, but for me it does. The fact that the main actor, according to the DVD notes, is not much of a believer, detracts somewhat from my willingness to wholeheartedly promote this film. Because usually people like that depict saints as good men or women, maybe like social reformers or fighters for the poor and less fortunate, but they soft-pedal or overlook the fact that all the saint's goodness comes forth because they have made themselves a conduit of God's goodness. Padre Pio prayed constantly - he said so himself. I'm not sure the movie adequately conveyed that. Sometimes I felt they were presenting Padre Pio as a man with special powers but downplaying the Source. Sorry - that's just me. Overall it is a good movie, though.",

His battles with Satan are chillingly portrayed, without a hint of any sort of psycho-spiritual mumbo jumbo as usually dominates Hollywood treatments of these subjects. The music and cinematography are first-rate. I recommend watching this film in Italian with English subtitles because the dubbed English is very distracting. This is an extremely fine film that goes a very long way toward revealing why Padre Pio is one of the most beloved and fascinating saints of all time. Very highly recommended.",

    "review/text": "This movie on the life of St. Pio is excellent! Even though St. Pio was known during his life time as a \"wonder-worker\", and had many angelic and demonic encounters throughout his life, and even had apparitions of both Jesus and Mary, St. Pio was still a human being. This movie shows people the life of St. Pio from HIS human perspective. The viewer will see St. Pio crying after a woman dies before his eyes, asking \"Why does he [Satan] always win?\" The viewer will see St. Pio get angry, laugh, love, and suffer.One of the most fascinating aspects of St. Pio's thinking was his shame of being chosen by God to bear the stigmatic wounds of Jesus. One of his first responses to the sitgmatic wounds is, \"Why? Why did God choose me?\". It is this shame that drives St. Pio to hide his stigmata. When the Pope grants permission to a (unbelieving) doctor to examine him, he responds, \"Are you hear to see the freak show? Sorry, the circus is closed.\" I think this highlights St. Pio's human character.Although St. Pio performed a multitude of miracles during his earthly life, these are not the focus of the film at all. This film shows a \"wonder-worker\" who thought if necessary to have a hospital built for the sick and suffering. This film shows a St. Pio who says, \"You can't always ask for miracles.\" In fact, although the movie shows St. Pio's gift of prophecy and heart-reading, the only other miracles that the movie shows are the lives that were changed by St. Pio's life of faith, hope, and love.Ultimately what this presentation of St. Pio's life gives to us viewers is the lesson that Christians are themselves \"sacraments\" (i.e., physical means through which God conveys His grace), and that we cannot expect our Christian lives to be overflowing with the supernatural. God works through our discipline, obedience, perseverance, prayer, and faith to spread His Kingdom.",

There was certainly some minor artistic license, but given what I have read about the life of Padre Pio, the writers and director stayed true to the biographical data. They honestly depicted his struggles, the depth of his relationship with God, and the impact Padre Pio had in the lives of all he encountered. In particular, I think the film does a masterful job of depicting the various crosses that Padre Pio was called to carry, his physical sufferings, as well and his spiritual ones.

    "review/text": "I noticed that some reviewers were offended by some of the liberties the filmmakers took with Padre Pio's life compared to his written biographies. However, I don't think the movie was disrespectful.Regarding the story with Cleonice Morcaldi, if it is true that he was accused of having close relationships with some of the women, then I think the way they treated this story was fair. It showed how it was possible for regular people to misconstrue their relationship, even though it was, in fact, an innocent relationship. The fact that the screenwriters showed Brunetto admitting to share the same affection as Morcaldi for Padre Pio created the sense that it was an innocent but overwhelming affection that crossed all people who met him...and not \"as you would think\", as Cleonice's character responds.Another point that offends some of the reviewers is the movie's portrayal of the Church as corrupt...that even Satan is portrayed to be a Bishop. First of all, the devil is a deceiver, so maybe the choice to portray the devil as a holy man actually falls along that line. I've read in other books that the devil appears to be handsome and attractive...not like the demons portrayed in horror movies. As far as the Church being portrayed as corrupt, it is true that corruption has existed in the Church, even though it is the Church that will prevail. Just because man has been corrupt does not take away from the holiness of Christ's Church which still stands 2000 years later.Overall, I understand the reviewers, especially those loyal to the books written about this extraordinary saint. However, I feel that watching this movie, which was beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, did not detract from my devotion to Padre Pio, and only encourages me to learn more about him. Perhaps it is no longer surprising to me that a movie, for dramatic effect, takes a few liberties and does not portray only the facts written in biographies. Like any translation, movies try to convey the core meaning, which may not be word-for-word. Other than perhaps a few factual discrepancies, the movie is very Catholic and reveals the beauty within this traditional religion, as well as the many gifts Padre Pio shared with his community and still shares with many who seek his intercession today.",

Pio faced a lot of persecution, even from his superiors, many of whom did not believe what was happening. He handled it with dignity, humor and grace. We should all learn from him! Of note; don't use the English dubbing as it sounds like someone reading a dictionary with no thought to the story or it's incredible content. Listen in Italian and read the subtitles.

    "review/text": "Having seen many saint films and documentaries, Padre Pio: Miracle Man stands out as the most powerful and superbly played. The entire production is excellent but Sergio Castellitto takes the film to amazing heights as he completely embodies the saint. For over three hours you feel as though you are truly in the presence of Padre Pio. This is extremely rare -- it's almost impossible to act like a saint w/o some vestiges of \"acting\" peeking through. The film and Castellitto's portrayal, i feel, has been blessed by the saint to bring his life and message of humility and sanctity to a wider audience of viewers. The cinematography, settings in the countryside of Italy and musical score all contribute to a truly uplifting experience. Recommended for viewers from all traditions, written by a follower of the Vedanta tradition.",

It's remarkable how much better movies have become since then; it is equally remarkable how our moral universe has changed. What's amazing is that this film is not about race. Poitier is depicted as a man, just a regular Joe who happens to be black. This would be inconceivable in this so-called enlightened time. There is also no hint whatsoever of sex. The nuns may giggle when Poitier shimmies and shakes, but they sure aren't turned on. This too is inconceivable in this day and age. The film is thin. It has loads of potential, but little is made of one of the keys points, which is that Poitier plays a Southern Baptist, who has come to live at a Catholic mission. All sorts of conflicts have been left out; the opportunity for real conflict is glossed over in favor of the rather thin plotting, which emphasizes Poitier's unexplained drive to finish the chapel. Other than Poitier, none of the actors stands out. The nuns are underwritten, as is the priest, and Mexican barman. What remains extraordinary are the film's central innocence, Poitier's charisma as a bona fide star, and the desert setting, which is so rarely used except in westerns.",

    "review/text": "I'll start this review much like I did with `Harry and Tonto', by being completely honest with you. I personally feel that Sidney Poitier is an extremely overrated actor. I find him rather stiff and when he does get into varying displays of emotion he feels forced in my opinion. I know that this a minority opinion here, but it is mine and I stand behind it firmly. He reminds me much of Nicolas Cage, very mannered and just the type of actor who does things from the book rather than from the heart. There is a difference, and that difference is that at least Cage has delivered two very Oscar worthy performances. Poitier was not so lucky.With that said, if I were Poitier on Oscar night back in 1963 (Oscars would have been held in 1964, but whatever) I would have been ashamed to look out at the audience and see my competitors, Rex Harrison, Albert Finney, Paul Newman and especially Richard Harris and know that I robbed them of an Oscar with a performance that isn't even in the same league as theirs.The film is also quite choppy and much undeserved of the Best Picture nomination it managed to rack up for itself. It is decent at best, but it never really takes off like it could have.`Lilies of the Field' tells the story of Homer Smith, a traveling handy-man who gets hustled into building a chapel for a group of German nuns he stumbles across in his travels. The nuns are lead by the very bossy yet very genuine Mother Maria. She has survived the Nazis and has retained war wounds so-to-speak, but while her interactions with others may seem stern and unsociable she has a tinge of weakness in her voice that plays on her fragility. Homer is apposed to staying, wanting his days wages and then to be off but Mother Maria fights him every step of the way until he decides to stay and finish the job. By the films end both characters learn to let their pride rest and embrace the love of others.The script isn't very deep, just riding on the surface of subject but never breaking into the type of character study this could have proved itself to be. It seems somewhat empty until the last few moments when some purpose is breathed into its lungs. Poitier tries to deliver here, but you can tell that he is trying and that kills a lot of the experience. The only performance I really found worthy of mention was that of Lilia Skala who played Mother Maria. She really got into the heart of this woman and managed to make her seem real to me.`Lilies of the Field' is raved by many, considered a masterpiece and a landmark in film. It is a landmark in that it provided us with the first African American Best Actor Oscar winner, a feat not to be repeated until 2001 when Denzel Washington won for his performance in `Training Day' (and since both Jamie Foxx and Forrest Whitaker have taken home top honors), but aside from that there is nothing impressive about this movie (and Poitier's win was very undeserved and thus very unimpressive).I know Oprah won't be happy with me for this, but it had to be said; sorry.",

I hated the scenes where he was just shuffling to please them. And I didn't understand why Mother Maria simply couldn't say 'Thank You' especially when she was begging for everything. Out of all the good roles Poitier has played, they give him the Oscar for when he played a good field slave doing what he was told. Whatever.",

I knew what the story was about before I bought it and when I saw it for sale I was very pleased . To anyone who thinks Sidney is a great actor will certainly enjoy this film . I also have Defiant Ones starring him and Tony Curtis (Excellent ) and Guess Who,s Coming to Dinner . Another winner for him Sidney , Spencer Tracey and Katharine Heburn > Buy them all!",

Anyway I got 2 teenagers girls 12 and boy 17 and this movie got them away from MTV and the cartoon channel and afterwards they where singing &quot;Amen&quot; making up there own bible verse lyrik along the way.

    "review/text": "I've read some of the other reviews for this movie, both pros and cons. I think people really need to take this movie for what it is, rather than what it could (or should) be.This was Poiter's breakout role. He had appeared in smaller roles leading up to this, and he was a very likable personality. I truly believe he won the Academy Award for Best Actor because people really responded to this newly arrived negro actor; whose character, personality and creativity were a refreshing break from the status quo.Also, the movie was made on a shoestring budget of just $240,000, which was a lot of money almost 50 years ago, but was still small potatoes compared to the average film. It had an \"indie\" feel to it, was a simple movie about faith, (which really appealed to people back then and now.)It was the dark horse nomination, because of its stature, subject matter, and main characters, but it was so warmly received at the time, it really overcame a lot of established attitudes. It was the kind of movie people really loved to love.Poiter plays something of a \"magic negro\" in this picture. You'll have to read up on that term, but it basically a black man who is completely non-threatening to whites, is always altruistic and trustable, and basically sacrifices himself for the good of the cause. There are a long list of movies with this character, and they are not bad movies at all. I appeals strongly to the white psyche, and makes black people more accessible. Poiter delivers this like a charm, and it won him the award.The movie itself was nominated for Best Picture, which is amazing when you consider the budget and production values. Like I said, its a movie people love to love. Its simple, engaging, tremendously charming, and appeals to all people on many levels. Its the kind of movie that is universally appealing.I think I watched it on TV when I was about 5 or 6, and I remember crying at the end. I found it very touching and cathartic when Homer signs his name at the top of the chapel. And of course, the uplifting and iconic \"Amen\" song, which transcends the movie itself and creates a persona of its own, (like the whistling tune from Bridge Over the River Kwai.) You can't help hum and sing along, as it stays with you for days; reminding you of the touching themes of the movie.Probably the strongest element of the movie, and often overlooked, is the very thematic and well-arranged musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, (same composer of the Waltons and dozens of other theme songs.) He was a master of this genre, and this was one of this best. The score was well applied, and helped the movie achieve its emotional goals.Its one of those \"special movies\" that achieves an emotional space few movies attain. Its what most people get involved with motion pictures for. It totally stands on its own, and has a very sincere honesty and homeyness that is totally endearing and acceptable. Like a good friend.Lilies of the Field still makes me cry. (And I don't totally know why.)",

It is the story of a group of German speaking nuns who need a miracle in order to build a church in a poor, desert town. The miracle comes in the form of an itinerant jack of all trades played by Poitier, whose faith is a little shabby around the edges. There is a lot of humor as the Mother Superior resorts to a little manipulation in order to see the church completed. Both Scala's character and Poitier's learn that they both needed to rely more on faith, and less on their own power. This is a movie for the whole family I think. It does deal with some issues on prejudice, and Poitier's character gets drunk at one point, but the Mother Superior sees that he does not enjoy the latter experience much. As for the way it dealt with prejudice, I thought it was well done for the time.",

It isn't clear how many of them will be staying. But, still, a chapel needs building, for a new faith community. And the Mother Superior (Lilia Skala) is determined to get it built despite the poverty, even if she has to be pushy and sneaky about it. Into her life, and the lives of the other nuns, rolls an itinerant black handyman (Sidney Poitier). A product of modern life, he can seem loud and thick-skinned, but, inside, he's a genuinely nice guy. He's the perfect foil to be tricked into building something he does not yet realize he is aching to build.Spoiler Alert! The following reveals the (rather obvious) ending:The Mother Superior never quite thanks the handyman for staying and building the chapel, and the handyman never quite thanks her for giving him a chance to build something he would proudly sign his name to. But you can see the thanks in their eyes. This aspect of the film is part of its timeless allure. Through ambition, resentment, push, and shove; despite sometimes hilarious conflict, we get things done. In the end no one person wins, because everyone wins. A new chapel is built in the desert.",

But if we choose to follow it, we should not expect thank you's, rewards, money, or even any recognition. The character played by Poitier is not treated well by the nuns at all, and yet he decides to accomplish what he was asked to do. Not that the nuns are portrayed badly, they are wonderful, pious sisters who humbly serve God and want the best for everyone, but are also determined and head strong: someone like Mother Teresa who if she was promised something by an official of a foreign government or company (for example building a orphanage), she would stubbornly pursue the issue until it was accomplished by that official. For those who love Catholic liturgy and history, figure out why the priest during the Mass in the movie is wearing sunglasses.",

What distinguishes Poitier from other actors that I have seen is the way in which he embodies the characters he brings to the screen. Poitier has the grace of a dancer and the presence of a prize fighter. His combination of charisma and realism in the role of Homer Smith absolutely grabs your attention and you can't help but watch him.Smith is an unemployed man, who is highly skilled with his hands and willing to take on odd jobs to make his way out of a small town in the Southwest. By a strange twist of fate, he encounters an Eastern European nun, Mother Superior Maria (Lilia Skala), who has prayed to God that she be brought someone to build a chapel for the large immigrant population in her parish. (They are holding worship services literally in the middle of the desert, with not church in sight.) Every time Homer tries to leave, (seemingly) a higher power keeps bringing him back to Maria and the other sisters (who speak few words of English).Not only is this film a great examination of faith and the power of prayer, but it also is a great examination of racial and cultural relations in 1960s United States, through the eyes of immigrants and an outsider. This film is intelligent, without being preachy. It will even make you smile.",

There are a lot of wonderful touching moments and funny interactions between these two main characters that will have you glued to the set.Sidney Poitier is masterful in this role and is greatly remembered for it. His subtle humor fills the plot, even becoming hilarious at times. In one scene Homer is teaching the German nuns English, and he cannot help himself from modeling for them some Southern black dialect: Instead of \"I stand up,\" he grins as the sisters follow his \"Ah stands up, y'all\"! Homer is so likable because he is good-natured, but Poitier lends texture to his character mainly through his interaction with his foil, the Mother Superior who will not thank him for all of his labors. Watch for strong musical scenes from Poitier as well, in which he intermingles his own religious background with the nun's East Germany Catholicism.Lilia Skala is appropriately stern and commanding as Mother Maria. We know the sisters have come a long way, even over the Berlin Wall, to get to this inherited property in the American desert. The broken English spoken by her and her charges serves to endear the nuns to us. They are all humble but fiercely devoted people. As Juan, Stanley Adams does nice work. Although his accent and diction smack of falseness - this man seems to want to revert to a Bronx twang - Adams musters a rascally nonchalance that bonds him with Homer. Juan also functions as a template for the modern age: Catholic-born, this agnostic now serves meals in his restaurant while the traveling priest says mass for the people who have come from far and wide.Dan Frazer does well as Father Murphy, the priest whose prayers for a massive cathedral were answered with a trailer with bald tires. And director Ralph Nelson ( who made many films beside this one, notably \"Requiem for a Heavyweight,\" \"Father Goose\" and \"Charly) acquits himself well as Mr. Ashton, the slightly racist builder who employs Homer and who is the victim of Mother Maria's constant pleas for donations. If you are looking for a small but thought-provoking work, a film that covers tolerance and faith and friendship through its exploration of a most unlikely relationship, watch \"Lilies of the Field.\"",

    "review/text": "If you are looking for a good introduction to the masterful actor, Sidney Poitier, I truly reccomend that you watch LILIES OF THE FIELD. What distinguishes Poitier from other actors that I have seen is the way in which he embodies the characters he brings to the screen. Poitier has the grace of a dancer and the presence of a prize fighter. His combination of charisma and realism in the role of Homer Smith absolutely grabs your attention and you can't help but watch him.Smith is an unemployed man, who is highly skilled with his hands and willing to take on odd jobs to make his way out of a small town in the Southwest. By a strange twist of fate, he encounters an Eastern European nun, Mother Superior Maria (Lilia Skala), who has prayed to God that she be brought someone to build a chapel for the large immigrant population in her parish. (They are holding worship services literally in the middle of the desert, with not church in sight.) Every time Homer tries to leave, (seemingly) a higher power keeps bringing him back to Maria and the other sisters (who speak few words of English).Not only is this film a great examination of faith and the power of prayer, but it also is a great examination of racial and cultural relations in 1960s United States, through the eyes of immigrants and an outsider. This film is intelligent, without being preachy. It will even make you smile.",

    "review/text": "Few films age as well as \"Lilies of the Field\". I saw it just recently for the first time in over 40 years and to my surprise it has lost none of its charm. It is just as light-hearted, humourous and relevant as I remembered it to be. Themes of racial harmony, brotherhood, community involvement and an honest day's work are still admirable values worth reminding us to practice.Sidney Poitier is the star here. And shine he does. His verbal sparring with Mother Maria (Lilia Skala) is brilliantly acted and memorable. He deservedly won an Oscar for his performance as the itinerant jack-of-all-trades Homer Smith. Lilia Skala's acting is stellar too as the strong-willed nun whose faith and perseverance convinces Homer Smith and others to build a chapel.The DVD itself is okay. Picture quality of this 1963 B&W; film is superb. Subtitles are in Spanish and French. The original trailer is a nice addition too.Overall, \"Lilies of the Field\" is a wonderful film for the entire family. It really doesn't matter what cultural or religious background you come from or what age group you fit in. My father was a German-American kid taught by Catholic nuns who had fled Nazi Germany, and I suppose there was a shared similarity with the East European nuns depicted in this film when he watched it. My wife is Malaysian, yet she thoroughly enjoyed this film. All of which just goes to show its message is universal and ageless.Get the movie. Read the novellaThe Lilies of the Field By William E. Barrett. Both are a delight.",

    "review/text": "I have a soft spot for &quot;Lilies of the Field.&quot; One of my favorite teachers first introduced me to this movie. I'll try (and probably fail) to be objective in my review.First, and most obviously, Sidney Poitier is amazing as Homer Smith. Homer is a little larger than life. Yet Poitier brings him off as not only believable, he turns Homer into an everyman of sorts.Beyond Poitier things get a little shaky.Lilia Skala is impressive indeed as the mother superior. Her harsh seeming exterior conceals a tender heart. The dignity she uses to deal with Smith's first leaving and return is truly endearing.That said, the other nuns and many of the villagers come off a little too cardboard-cut-outish for my taste. There is also some pretty &quot;sixties&quot; acting (where you can visibly see the actor acting). Luckily, these flaws are easily overcome by the immense heart of this film.At its core, Lilies of the Field is about resurrection and unexpected fulfillment. Coming together under the guidance of an unseen hand (&quot;he build the chapel&quot;), disparate people find more to life than what had seemed to be there before. The scene with the Priest at the end still gets me after seeing it more than a few times.I give &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; my heartfelt recommendation.",

It is a story about growth, sacrifice, faith, and the power of human beings to occasionally work a small miracle or two.A group of German nuns believe that a black, baptist drifter has been sent to build a chapel for their remote, Mexican-American community in Arizona. He disagrees, but can't seem to bring himself to move on; and so the fun begins.Yes, this is a serious story, but the movie is full of joy, good humor, and surprises. Although faith is an important part of the movie, it is not forced down your throat. Sidney Poitier is wonderful as the happy go lucky Homer Smith, and Lilia Skala is a delightfully tough Mother Superior. There are no car chases, guns, fights, romances, or scantily clad women This is just a great story that happens to be superbly performed. I recommend it most highly!",

    "review/text": "Simple, uncluttered, charming- sadly, this film could not be made today simply because the mentality of so many Hollywood studios is steeped in formulaic storytelling: more sensationalism (they would want Homer Smith to exude more action, and maybe have a hot romance), and more youth (the 36-year old Sidney Poitier would be considered too old for the role today; Hollywood would want a younger, and definitely &quot;edgier&quot; actor to do the role now. Ice Cube? Mekhi Phifer?) As it is, the story gets to the point in short order, and gives a stronger lesson about teamwork, tolerance, and faith in its 94 minutes than most modern films do today (I'm sure there are cynics who'll read this and pigeonhole it in so-called 'political correctness' because it dares to mention positive race relations, but whether you agree or not, that is part of the world we live in). One could even argue that Poitier's relationship with Mother Superior Lilia Skala never really reaches a warm-and-fuzzy breakthrough, but I accept that compromise based on the fact that the characterizations are tight as a drum, and leave little room for a 180-degree change. (After the completion of the chapel there are various facial ponders, but no further dialogue; only the chant of &quot;Amen-&quot; as it should be.) Check it out, and marvel at a film that cost less than a quarter million dollars to make.",

Poitier played the handyman stranger, Homer Smith, who helps build a chapel for German-speaking nuns in the American southwest. Poitier played a man of dignity and purpose that is pitted in a friendly but feisty test of wills between him and Mother Maria, leader of the nuns, played by Lilia Skala. This is a wonderful film that explores the idea that one should never underestimate the divine tools that we are given and that sharing those tools can be both rewarding and gratifying. Jerry Goldsmith composed a moving and uplifting score combining both idioms of Americana and Gospel. Sidney Poitier is perfect as Homer Smith. After feasting on a single fried egg from the nuns each morning Poitier's description of the breakfast he orders from Stanley Adams in the diner is a gastronomic mouthwatering delight. It's one of the best and most amusing scenes in the movie and demonstrates Poitier's versatile appeal.",

    "review/text": "Let me start this off with one irreversible fact: I am not a religious person. Thus it is a pleasant surprise for me to be charmed by a film which, quite simply, is about faith. Not faith in the traditional evangelical sense, which is perhaps why it appeals to me; it's about faith in other people, in honesty and commitment, and...sappy as it sounds...in doing good.One key reason why I enjoyed &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; is because my favorite films are character-centred dramas (especially black and white ones!). This is just one in a list of such films released under MGM's &quot;Vintage Classics&quot; DVD label, joining the ranks of such greats as &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; and &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot;. They are simple, well-scripted and directed films that, when all is said and done, sink or swim on the quality of one thing: an actor's performance, in this case the legendary Sidney Poitier. He carries the character of Homer Smith with expert precision, neither making him overly-compassionate or overly-selfish (a lesser actor might have gone one of these two directions), and very much deserving of the Academy Award he won. He is of course joined by several quality supporting actors, most notably Lilia Skala as the cantankerous Mother Maria and Stanley Adams in a rare dramatic role as the gas station owner, Juan.Ultimately, the story is a little on the thin side - it is _very_ simplistic, even more so than most movies of its kind - and some characters, especially the other nuns, do little more than nod and smile, but the natural warmth and humor of the film carry it the full 95-minute length and leave the viewer feeling satisfied. It is a very charming picture and great for the whole family...especially during the holidays (despite having no actual holiday 'ties'). Even if you're a bit skeptical, give it a try - I don't think you'll regret it.",

It has a raft of themes relating to conviction, determination, belief, community and, above all, having a higher sense of purpose in life. It is beautifully filmed in black and white and, of course, features outstanding performances from Sidney Poitier, Lilia Skala and Stanley Adams. Movies like this, made on a very small budget, make you realize the incredible void in talent and imagination that currently exists in the modern movie industry - talent seems to have given way to special effects and high tech gimmicks. The other feature of Lilies of the Field is that it is a positive movie that doesn't indulge in the negativity of the current plethora of big budget movies that are around.

He stops at their delapidated farm house to fix a leaky roof. To his great surprise, the Mother Superior does not have any money to pay him for his work; she, also, to his astonishment, wants him to build them a chapel for free too. Needless to say, Homer is flabbergasted and hesitates, at first, to begin the work; yet, he single-handedly begins erecting the chapel knowing full well that he will not receive any money. What spurrs him on is the thought that when the work is completed he will leave this woebegone desert town a better place than when he found it.",

    "review/text": "Lilies of the Field is a 1963 black-and-white film directed by Ralph Nelson. It stars Sidney Poitier in an Academy-winning role as a young man named Homer Smith who lives in his car and befriends a group of German immigrant nuns on the way. The mother superior believes God has sent Homer to help them build a chapel. Homer reluctantly agrees on the condition she pays him for his services. When it becomes clear to him, they are penniless and have as much power of paying him as sending him to the moon he disappears, leaving the chapel half finished. However, he returns in a week to honor his word and do all he agreed to do out of the goodness of his heart.Sidney Poitier pulls off Homer's strengths and weaknesses well and brings a considerable amount of warmth and charm to the role. Lilia Skala also gives a great performance as the Mother Abbess and her interviews with Poitier are among the film's finest moments.James Poe's screenplay does an excellent job exploring the motivations of the characters in a short and snappy but sufficient manner. No guns, no cowboys and Indians, no romance, no sci-fi creatures; just good decent ordinary people and the clash of strong personalities.Four Stars",

I haven't sat still to watch a movie aired on TV in ages! This is another one of those great movies from an era gone too soon, that allows us to piece together an opinion of what's happening instead of telling us what to think! I just love the interaction between Smith and the main nun/missionary; he's adamant he won't do a certain thing, only to be compelled by her monotone stubbornness.The scene in which he gives them an English lesson was one of the finest examples of characters playing off one another. The nuns/missionaries and Smith couldn't have possibly been more different, but here he was teaching them, and they caught on rather quickly!Today, storytelling like this is limited to the so-called Oscar season, and often wasted on films with great concepts but incredibly horrible promotion (not saying the English Patient would've topped the box office, but you get my point). It is my endeavour to get my children exposed to classic films early, since today's modern films are high on flash, but often lacking in substance (you know that sinking feeling you get when you re-watch a modern movie, only to realize you only like maybe 20 minutes of the film).",

    "review/summary": "Excellent!",
    "review/text": "Sidney Poiter is one of my favorite actors. He is not only smart and talented but also embodies a sense of decency no matter what character he's playing. In this, he is like few other actors. (Gregory Peck and, to a lesser degree, Robert Redford come to mind.) He has enormous charisma even in some of his later, less satisfying movies. It is not an accident, corny as it may sound, that I was inspired as a boy to even consider teaching by his turn in \"To Sir, with Love\"; I've long since moved on from any such idealistic notions, but Poitier made teaching an even nobler calling than it is. I was surprised that I'd not seen \"Lilies of the Field\" until recently, both because it is one of my mother's favorite movies and because it got him a well-deserved Academy Award. (I'm also surprised that it was directed by Ralph Nelson, whose eclectic body of works includes the uber-violent \"Soldier Blue\" a few years later.) The story is sweet and grounded in reality. A handyman drifter encounters a group of destitute, mostly German nuns who through a combination of beguilement and determination get him to build them a chapel. For most of the film, Poitier's Homer Smith butts heads with Mother Maria Mathe (Lilia Skala), whom at one point he compares to Hitler. She is tough-as-nails, and in one particularly charming scene, out Bibles the Baptist Smith in a contest of using scripture to find a way to not have to pay him. Smith, or Schmidt, as the nuns call him, ultimately and not surprisingly comes around to their way of thinking. Based on a novel by William Edmund Barrett, \"Lilies of the Field\" is sentimental without being treacly, succeeding more because it is honest than because of anything manipulative. It doesn't ram religion down anyone's throat, and yet makes believing in something more meaningful than petty self interest as natural an expression of human experience as eating and breathing. Even Jerry Goldsmith's modest score, including the hymn \"Amen,\" never overshadows the sincerity of the emotions. The movie may seem quaint in this age of mega churches and assembly-line tithing and salvation, but, its dramatic qualities notwithstanding, \"Lilies of the Field\" says more about the spirit of what it preaches than a thousand fire and brimstone types resorting to telling rather than showing, or, perhaps, pontificating rather than living.",

Every inch of film pays homage to the great American desert. A constant visual starkness makes the rich, inviting heart of the film only riper and wiser than it otherwise would be. Frame by frame, with prodigal ease, Lilies of the Field offers nothing less than the full blown promise of everything American cinema could have become since 1963, but which, with few exceptions, failed to materialize, corporate fantasies supplanting cinematic art. The notable lineage of the great independent films can be traced to this one masterpiece, and to this day every actor can only raise his or her own art by watching Poitier incarnate Homer Smith with a jewelsmith's love and attention that can unstop your heart. You can watch this movie a hundred times and be only glad. Its hope is ineradicable, and its truth unnegotiable. You need to own a copy. DVD transfer quality is exceptional throughout.",

    "review/text": "In our home, on Sundays, regular television broadcasting is entirely avoided, as well as most secular movies. We generally watch only what we call \"scripture movies\"--those specifically designed to support gospel teaching. \"Lilies of the Field\", while secular does indeed support gospel principles in a wonderfully subtle, simple, yet poignant and entertaining way. The film encourages serving others, recognizing that our Heavenly Father loves all of us equally despite our differences of race, religion, etc., that we are all blessed with gifts which He intends for us to use to serve His purposes and in so doing serve our \"neighbor\".Sidney Portier's Oscar-winning performance is spectacular. But when has it not been? You finish watching this film and want to go out and perform some unselfish service for someone with as much grace, care and good humor as \"Schmidt\". Yes, initially, Homer would have liked to have been paid. As it turns out he was, just not in cash. He gained the view of himself as being of much greater worth than \"mammon\" and a peaceful release of a self-sabotaging pride in the of realization of at least one of his dreams. For once the chapel is complete, he carves his name in so obscure a place that no one else is ever likely to see it and give him credit for the building. But that's okay with Homer now, HE KNOWS that he may truly call himself contractor, engineer and Master Craftsman.Not only is this movie delightful for its life lessons, but for its ability to appeal to anyone, hopefully, everyone. I have three sons, ten and under. All of them are as in love with video games and gratuitously, action-packed films as any other boys I know. Still, whenever the boys have a Monday off from school (\"Lilies...\" is feature length unlike \"scripture movies\",so they are allowed to stay up late enough to watch it), the Sunday viewing line up WILL, invariably, include \"Lilies of the Field\" -- THEIR choice. Indeed, my oldest claims it as one of his favorites, right up there with Star Wars films. It makes me happy since it is of such high quality and has been one of my favorites since childhood, too.The HOPE I mention in my subject line refers to this film's managing to retain a full dose of it, notwithstanding the tests of time, the scarcity of respectable, humble male African American characters in film, plummeting values and standards in all forms of entertainment, fluctuating race/nation relations and the increasing frenzy to acquire money and things by any means--good or evil--necessary.We watch this film on DVD and the quality is perfectly sufficient.",

    "review/text": "Although highly regarded in its day, &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; is now considered a relic of the civil rights era or Hollywood's token Oscar &quot;gesture&quot; to a Black performer. This is unfortunate, since it underrates both the film and Poitier's textured performance. &quot;Lilies...&quot; is a simple, funny and touching story that emphasizes respect for the differences in people. Lilia Skala gives a powerhouse performance as the Mother Superior, almost stealing the film from Poitier. She gives just the right measures of rage and prideful determination to make her character sadly noble. Hers is one of the most memorable supporting performances on film, and she deserved an Oscar as well. But this is Poitier's show, and he gives the character of Homer humor, rebeliousness and magnanimity that make him unique in films. Rather than the usual angry political stance Hollywood takes with anything involving race, this character is presented as simple, decent, a little lost, but just an average man doing the best he can. There's nothing &quot;special&quot; about him, which makes the character (and Poitier's performance) special and memorable. Of note in this edition, the digital transfer of the film is especially crisp and vivid, not the usual slack job MGM does with these older films. Unfortunately, there are almost no extras, and it would have been great to have a commentary by Poitier to listen to. Still, this is a memorable film for the whole family. Makes me wanna holler.",

Ralph Nelson, director, was lucky enough to get Poitier to bring vibrant life to the simple novel of William Barrett. Poitier won the Oscar, and most deserved (some may take issue that Albert Finney's Tom Jones should've). One thing that some people miss is the fact that the nuns had been through hell, and so has the Black man. Once they connect, and understand each others' hell (or redemption), life goes on and goodness happens. I take exception with previous reviewers who said the townsfolk were inadequate; Stanley Adams has always been a reliable actor (Summer & Smoke). The new respect for independent film makes me think that this is a better film than we realize. The best thing of all is that any actor, of any color, could play this role. Hispanics play an important part, though none of it is important. Working together, what a concept; even in 1963. I will always be impressed with this film. PS~After repeated viewings, I was thinking that when Homer first approaches the nuns habitat, with a different music score, this could be a slasher film.

    "review/text": "This is a smooth effortless beautiful story of faith. Other stories just seem to try so hard to make a point. This one succeeds!I used to watch this when I was a child. I saw it again over the weekend with my niece who is 13. Every movie I dusted off to play she would revert back to her toddler days and start whining. But I stuck to my guns and made her watch this. Of course the whining was even louder when she saw it was in Black and White, but it didn't take long for her to be reeled in. This movie is so endearing and it always amazes me how in ANY movie Sidney Poitier did in the early sixties he struck such a cord with the viewers to where you could not take your eyes off of him. NO ONE could have made this role work other than him, even Gregory Peck who I adore. Somehow it just wouldn't have been the same at all.With faith that could move a mountain the Reverend Mother thanks God for the man who will build a Chapel for her as Homer Smith or \"Omer Schmitt\" as she refers to him, stops there for water. When he notices her giving Thanks, he is very quick to tell her he is \"just passing thru\" to which she replies \"Yah.... but you stopped.\" So begins the battle of faith and wills. She has no money in which to pay him; he works for hire so he can go further out west, yet thru her faith in God Homer will build her a \"SHAP-IL\". Homer's charm and generosity both melts some of her icy exterior and makes her let go of her ferocious pride as head of household when he brings brightness to the sisters' barren existence yet he doesn't allow her to run him over. (Not every time.) Although he and the Reverend Mother are just like oil and water Homer finds that he cannot up and leave them.It's amazing how a story whose cinematography shows the starkness of the landscape with the nuns walking in the distance (just 5 little black dots against a panoramic landscape of blazing white) and gentle story line can make you feel serene and happy where you would not usually equate the desert to those feelings. It's such a beautiful flowing mix of emotions and visions that you can't help but feel heart broken when the reverend mother realizes at the end what is going on when the sisters are singing \"Amen.\" You want everything to stay just as it is. This story just seems to flow with no effort.It just unfolds...... absolutely beautiful.",

    "review/text": "I was born in 1963 the year \"Lilies of the Field\" was released. It's not possible for me to gauge the impact this gentle film had in easing tensions in a racially fraught time in our country. Fortunately, this film is not merely a time capsule curio but one whose message of universal kindness and understanding is timeless. Why this film is not a heavy-handed message film is that director Ralph Nelson leavens the proceedings with light-hearted humor that would win over the most hard-hearted cynic. The film is also blessed with a towering performance by Sidney Poitier as handyman Homer Smith. Smith is a talented but directionless man who does not find his life calling until a group of Eastern bloc nuns entreat upon him to build them a chapel to serve a Mexican migrant congregation. The impulse could have been for Poitier to play Homer as some kind of Superman but he manages to tap into the foibles and humor of the character. Poitier won the Oscar for this role and in this case the Academy got it right. I can't recall a film where he's been better. He's matched well with the stern taskmaster Mother Superior played by Lilia Skala. In this season of good will, or any time of the year, this film is essential viewing. Amen.",

    "review/text": "After reading Sidney Poitier's recent memoir &quot;Measure of a Man,&quot; interest in this film was rekindled. Does this black and white, 1960's film stand up in these contemporary times? Not only does it stand up, it stands up with a pride and dignity that puts most of today's lame Hollywood efforts to shame!This is a simple story, but it is proof that a simple story, illuminating simple human truths, if told well, can go on to live powerfully in one's memory. A wandering man inadvertendly stumbles onto a convent of nuns who believe that he has been &quot;sent&quot; to build their long awaited church. His better sense tells him to move on. His heart tricks him into staying. A crazy idea gradually transforms into a collective project, and the embodiment of a dream fulfilled. I also like that Poitier's character is so well defined and developed that the fact that he is black and the nuns are white does not factor one bit into the telling of the story. Interestingly, Poitier points out in his memoir that the production of this film oddly anticipated the story it told. The director was given a paltry sum to make the movie, since producers were convinced it would not be successful. Rather than conclude that the budget was too tight, the director carried on, asking the cast and crew to make extraordinary sacrifices, including unpaid rehearsal (in violation of actors' union rules). But such was the faith of those committed to bringing &quot;Lillies of the Field&quot; to screen. Such was the faith portrayed in the film. So, in effect, a wondrous film that simply HAD to find its way to realization. Great for the whole family in an era of aggressively marketed trash.",

It has as much integrity as Huckleberry Finn deciding to go to hell instead of betraying his friend Jim. This movie is much more light-hearted than Mark Twain, but they share an accurate view of the way people really approach religion in their personal lives.

The Wrestler also highlights the home of Gagne/AWA - Minnesota - with an interesting scene taking place where Gagne actually trained those who were seeking a pro career.This is a neat double play and a great look into the cross-promotion of two sports superstars as celluloid heroes.",

    "review/text": "Just so you know, I've given this movie 4 stars - not because it is a great movie. It is not, unless you are a diehard Petty fan. But, it is a valuable piece of NASCAR history - a little gem that I picked up in the super-cheap DVD section of a local store. It is a snapshot of the beginnings of the modern heydey of stock car racing.Released in 1974 and full of footage from the early days of NASCAR, the production values in this one are not great, which is a mixed blessing. The old footage does not stick out from the rest of the film because the film itself is pretty grainy and has questionable sound at times.Richard Petty plays himself and he comes off as a fairly wooden actor, which would be a pretty unfair assessment to make if you are not familiar with Richard's personality. He is slow-talking (careful with his words), casual, straight-backed and was as hard a driver as there ever was. So, Petty pretty much plays himself as I've always seen him.Long-time mechanic Dale Inman plays himself. Darren McGavin (most famous for his role as the dad in \"A Christmas Story\") plays Lee Petty and Noah Beery, Jr. (most famous for his role as Rockford's dad in \"The Rockford Files\") plays Richard Petty's grandfather.The plot of the movie is basically a set of flashbacks from the Petty family while Richard is in the hospital after a bad wreck in the World 600.The 2nd movie on the disc is \"The Wrestler\" starring Ed Asner. Asner is a wrestling promoter. The movie features a number of famous wrestlers from the old days such as Dick the Bruiser, Ric Flair, and Dusty Rhodes. The sound quality on my DVD was very poor (very quiet).",

Ganz suggests the internal conflict with his moral beliefs and loving family outlook.He is lured in by the bait Raul Pinot (Blain) offers him :new tests in the American Hospital in Paris by a top specialist. Ripley has been the catalyst for this new adventurous, amoral life,following a slight he receives from Zimmerman.Ripley is a loner cowboy adrift in Hamburg,consumed with existential angst. He is drawn towards Zimmerman's hard-working honesty and warm family home. In an early scene Ripley records his thoughts in a taped diary:\"There is nothing to fear but fear itself...I know less and less about who I am or who anybody else is\".Hopper has never been better or more restrained and calm.There are two marvellous set-pieces set on trains.The first thriller sequence is in a subway station depicting Jonathan's inept murder of an underworld figure. The second set on a moving train where he is joined surprisingly by Ripley, is worthy of Hitchcock. There is a lot of physical force and suspense,the use of garrotting and bodies pushed out of trains. There is a lot of black humour in a scene with tickets.Also there is a homage to American film noir (cf two directors,Ray and Fuller cast as conmen and criminals),also the role of Ripley as a sleazy conman with mob connections.Ripley shows his humanity by wanting to be Jonathan's `American friend'.There is great chemistry between the two leads.What is stressed is everybody's moral ambivalence. The truly interesting expressionist quality of the cinematography,unusual use of colour and lighting,with cityscapes bathed in dark blues and dark greens and a somewhat faded background palette overlaid with strikingly bright and saturated primary colours for particular objects or costumes.There is the influence of Edward Hopper on the framing and camera angles,with Knieper's brooding score to suggest the intensity and danger round every corner of the seedy industrial backlots of Hamburg.There are a lot of motifs centred around picture slides and moving pictures which figure in gift exchange between the `friends' His wife Erica(excellent Kreuzer) is aware Jonathan is not giving her the whole picture:\"I don't even want to know what you do with your American friend\".The corruptive influence of American movies is a major theme. This will be seen as one of Wender's major films with Alice in the Cities and Kings of the Road.",

    "review/text": "\"The American Friend\" was the first cinematic adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel \"Ripley's Game\", the third book in her Ripley series, written for the screen and directed by Wim Wenders. The film can be viewed simply as neo-noir or as an allegory of the American economic conquest of Europe, which was held in distaste by many authors of New German Cinema. It imparts an unmistakable sense of time -the 1970s- and of its artistic philosophy, but Wenders blurs the distinctions between Hamburg, Paris, and New York by focusing on their industrialism. \"The American Friend\" may be more interesting as political cinema than as a thriller, but it is also more dated. Wenders wittily cast seven directors to play his villains, starting with Dennis Hopper as sociopath Tom Ripley.Tom Ripley (Dennis Hopper) is an American dealer in counterfeit artwork living in Hamburg, West Germany. His fateful introduction to art restorer Jonathan Zimmerman (Bruno Ganz) at an auction for a forged painting sets a bizarre series of events in motion. Raoul Minot (Gerard Blain), an associate of Ripley's, asks Ripley to settle an old debt by killing a man for him. Ripley is reluctant to do the job himself, so he suggests Zimmerman, who is suffering from a serious blood disease. Minot promises Jonathan 250,000 deutschmarks to kill a man in the Paris subway, insisting that Jonathan has little time to live anyway, and this would allow him to leave his family well cared-for. Jonathan is shocked by the proposition but somehow seduced by it into a violent and chaotic world.\"Ripley's Game\" retained its name in a second movie adaptation in 2002 that aspired only to be a psychological thriller. \"The American Friend\" is more successful than \"Ripley's Game\", but the two films have completely different narrative focus. \"The American Friend\" tends toward character study. It's about Jonathan, portrayed by the superb and meticulous Bruno Ganz as a regular guy whose introversion conceals a morbid angst. Why does Jonathan want to believe that he is dying? Why does he trust a murderous stranger with obvious ulterior motives? Why does he willingly plunge his life into chaos and terror? Those are the questions at the heart of \"The American Friend\". The later film \"Ripley's Game\" marginalized the wiling victim in favor of the more forceful and colorful characters of Tom Ripley and his nefarious acquaintance.In \"Ripley's Game\", Tom Ripley is an outright sophisticate, played seductively by John Malkovich. Tom Ripley of \"The American Friend\" vacillates strangely and inexplicably between sophisticate and coarse, ugly American. Where \"Ripley's Game\" has sharp, articulate dialogue, \"The American Friend\" has improvisation and eccentric behavior. Though some of his antics are undoubtedly intended as metaphor, Ripley's character is incoherent, making him the weak link in this film. But \"The American Friend\" is much stronger film noir than \"Ripley's Game\", in spite of its freestyle dialogue, because Jonathan Zimmerman is a true noir protagonist, and his plight is this film's focus. In English and German with English subtitles.The DVD (Anchor Bay 2003): There are 36 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by Wim Wenders, a theatrical trailer (3 min), and text bios with selective filmographies for Wim Wenders, Bruno Ganz, and Dennis Hopper. There is a feature commentary by writer/director Wim Wenders and actor Dennis Hopper. Wenders talks about actors, lighting, the cinematography of Robby Muller, locations, some technical details, and the film's reception. Hopper comments on Wender's directing style, and both men recall the spontaneity of the performances and rewrites. They do not discuss characters, story, or themes. I had trouble accessing the audio commentary. After selecting the commentary, I could only get it to play with the film by going to the scene selection menu and starting at scene 2. I may have a defective disc, but if you have trouble, try using the scene selection menu.",

Zimmerman suffers from a blood disease and Ripley exploits the German's fears by insinuating that he is at death's door. Ripley manipulates Zimmerman into becoming a hitman for a European mobster.

    "review/text": "I saw this movie when it was first released on VHS years ago. The reason I rented it was because I was in a big Dennis Hopper phase and trying to watch just about everything he had done. This was during the time of him cleaning up and his resurgence with Blue Velvet and directing Colors. I must say that the movies I watched usually broke down into two categories. The first was the early Hopper portraying the weakling son of the bad man. The other was the very messed up and drug addicted Hopper which had its highlights as he rambled to a great performance in Apocalypse Now but most were really bad movies that were hard to watch. All that said, I must say that Wim Wenders adaptation of Ripleys Game 'American Friend' was a huge suprise and ended up being one of my all time favorites. It also introduced me to the great actor Bruno Ganz. But in this movie Hopper is his equal and they both turn in fascinating performances. Of course this movie was out before The Talented Mr. Ripley with Jude Law and Matt Damon. Since I had never read the books I had nothing to go on. Wim Wenders direction is great and the story is interesting and just keeps you focused. Ganz is great as the German frame maker who owns a little shop and who meets the strange, complex and brilliant shady Tom Ripley (Hopper). Hopper is involved in the criminal underworld. One of his enterprises is the selling of fake art. He tricks Ganz into doing some 'wet work' for his criminal friends by getting him involved in a murder for hire plot because they spin a scheme that has him believe that his physical condition (a blood disease that is controlled)is much worse and that he only has a limited time to live. In time manipulation morphs into a kind of friendship between the two.I won't go any further because I don't want to spoil the story for anybody who wants to watch. This is a good foreign film but refreshingly is easy to follow and has quite a bit of English dialogue. I believe a good bit of the movie takes place in both Germany and in France (haven't seen it in a long time).One last funny story about this movie. A girl I was dating rented The Talented Mr. Ripley when it first came out. I watched it and liked it very much. I told the story of a young Tom Ripley and it was excellent. A few years later I picked up another copy of American Friend and viewed it. As I was watching I caught Hoppers characters name, Tom Ripley. I immediately realized that the big hit movie of the day 'The Talented Mr. Ripley's' or at least its main character had been done years before in a brilliant Wim Wenders adaptation 'American Friend'. So I did a google search and found this is an adaptation of the novel 'Ripleys Game'. I guess this movie has been remade recently with John Malkovich as Ripley in the feature film Ripleys Game. Also I understand that the Ripley character has also been done by Alain Delon in one of the earliest adaptions of Ripley.",

    "review/summary": "\"I like to make money and I travel a lot.\" Tom Ripley also enjoys now and then corrupting a good man",
    "review/text": "If you're thinking about a man who just wants to lead the good life, it's hard to beat that charming sociopath, Tom Ripley. Conscience is just a vestigial organ in Ripley's psychological anatomy. He enjoys the things money can buy. Just don't get between Ripley and what he wants, or underestimate his sense of due respect. His appreciation of amusing irony can cut your life short, or make it unpleasant, or both.Der Amerikanische Freund (The American Friend), a German film by Wim Wenders based on Patricia Highsmith's Ripley's Game, gives us a couple of ironic pleasures of our own. First, if you're into the enjoyment of corrupting a good man by turning him into an assassin, the story is hard to beat. Second, we're able to compare this same story brought to the film by two interesting directors and to observe differences in approach and style. This version by Wenders came out in 1977 and featured Dennis Hopper as Ripley.Ripley's Game, directed by Liliana Cavani, came out in 2002 and featured John Malkovich as Ripley. Both films have merit. Both, unfortunately, sank almost without a trace. Seems a lot of people just don't have a taste for irony or the corruption of the innocent.Jonathan Zimmermann (Bruno Ganz) is a happily married man who is a picture framer. He briefly meets Tom Ripley at an auction but refuses to shake his hand. Ripley's reputation has preceded him. Jonathan has a serious blood disease and then learns he has little time left. He desperately wants to make sure his wife and young son, both of whom he loves deeply, are provided for when he dies. (Dougray Scott plays the same character, renamed Jonathan Trevanny, in Ripley's Game.) Then Zimmermann gets an offer for a great deal of money. All he has to do is murder a bad guy or two. One way or another, Tom Ripley is involved,And things go wrong. The worst is that Jonathan and Tom develop a kind of friendship that should be morally repugnant if you're a good guy like Jonathan. For all us good guys in the audience, however, the situation is so well set up that all that follows is fascinating, creepy and unnervingly satisfying. Don't count on happy endings.Both versions of Highsmith's novels are well worth seeing. I'd give the edge to Ripley's Game for two reasons. Wenders approaches the story, in my view, too deliberately and auteurishly. Cavani gets us going more efficiently and keeps up the pace. Since both directors wrote their own screenplays, I think Cavani simply came up with a better-crafted movie. Part of that impression is due to the actor who plays Ripley. Ripley's style, his amusement, his lack of a moral code is central, and John Malkovich is better at this kind of cool approach than Dennis Hopper. Plus, I'll admit, I've never much cared for Hopper's acting or his voice. Bruno Ganz and Dougray Scott are first rate. Ganz was and is one of Germany's most acclaimed actors. Nearly 26 years after The American Friend, Ganz starred as Adolph Hitler inDownfall(Der Untergang). It was a mesmerizing performance. One of Scott's best roles was Tom Jericho inEnigma.This comparison business comes down to the happy chore, if you're interested, of watching both movies, enjoying them, and observing the differences, especially in the portrayals of Tom Ripley. While Ripley's Game is definitely John Malkovich's movie, The American Friend comes very close to being Bruno Ganz's. You won't be disappointed in either movie; you'll just probably enjoy one a little more than the other.Wenders also slips in some inside jokes, something that, for me, is akin to condescension. The idea that a clever few are enjoying the thrill of knowing something not available to most is juvenile. Among the pleasures for the insiders is Wenders casting in small parts as crooks a number of directors. You may or may not enjoy seeing Nicholas Ray and Samuel Fuller on their last legs.Both the video and audio on the DVD seemed muddy to me. There are several extras, including a commentary track featuring Wenders and Hopper. A good deal of the film is in English, but the subtitles when used are easy to read.",

    "review/text": "Wim Wenders always directs top notch films, and this one is no exception. It is an unusual film noir. It is not in black and white, it takes place in Hamburg in the 1970s, and it lacks some of the typical noirish thrills. There is, however, much implicit fear in this film, as the main German character, Jonathan Zimmermann is manipulated by rival international groups like a pawn on a chessboard. Although not an overtly political film, it does (inadvertently or otherwise) reflect the beliefs of some West Germans in the 1970s that their country was dominated, culturally and otherwise, by the United States: the film contrasts the German master craftsman with the American materialist; the \"weak\" West German with the strong, but evil, American.The original working title of this film was \"Framed,\" a double-entendre which relates both to Zimmermann's work and the manner in which he is set up. Dennis Hopper gives the performance of his career as the malevolent, paranoid, psychopathic \"American Friend,\" who is set off by Zimmermann's curtness toward him at an art auction. But his performance is dwarfed by that of Bruno Ganz, who carries the movie as Zimmermann, a man suffering from a blood disease who lacks the ability to swim against the whirlpool of events sucking him ever downward. The contrast of characters moves the plot along, and the harbor city of Hamburg provides unusual, but often dismal, scenery. This film is well worth watching.",

    "review/summary": "This `friend' exhibits an underlying menace that is sure to stop your breath...",
    "review/text": "`Der Amerikanische Freund' is dark and mysterious and ultimately rewarding, even if at times it is a tad confusing and ambiguous. Loosely adapted from Patricia Highsmith's novel `Ripley's Game', `Der Amerikanische Freund' is a story of suspense and murder. Patricia Highsmith did for the world of literature what Alfred Hitchcock did for the world of cinema (could be why they made the perfect pairing when Hitchcock adapted Highsmith's masterful novel `Strangers on a Train' for the big-screen) and so it's obvious when watching any adaptation of one of her novels that the viewer is in for a moody and tense piece. In actuality I have not read any of her Ripley novels so I can't say just how loosely this is adapted, but one thing is for sure; director Wim Wenders definitely understood the mood Highsmith would have wanted to capture.The film follows a picture framer named Jonathan Zimmermann who is dying of a rare blood disease. He's panicky about leaving behind his beautiful wife Marianne and his young son Daniel. When he first meets American Tom Ripley at an art auction he is rude and disgruntled. He doesn't like Ripley's character. The film shifts gears when Jonathan is approached by Raoul Minot, a man who needs a favor. He offers Zimmermann a substantial amount of money if he murders someone for him. The details are sketchy and even when the credits begin to roll the audience has plenty of questions about what really happened, but the details really become null and void when one focuses on what Wenders wants us to focus on.The film is a character study more than anything else; a study of desperation and guilt and the ultimate love and loyalty. Bruno Ganz is marvelous as Jonathan Zimmermann and really brings this man to life. We see the many stages of his emotional breakdown; his confidence diminishes to fear and paranoia until he finally loses it. Ganz is an actor I really want to see more of. I remember back a few years when I saw him chew up the screen as Adolf Hitler in `Der Untergang' and I immediately wanted to research his catalogue of films but until recently hadn't got around to it. After watching his intense performance here though I will make an even more constructive effort to get my hands on more Ganz.Dennis Hopper stars as Tom Ripley, and it is here that I am left a tad unimpressed. Like I mentioned, I have not read any of Highsmith's `Ripley' novels. I have read a few of her other novels and have been meaning to get my hands on the Ripley's but I just have not had the time. So because of that I cannot tell who does a better job of fleshing out Ripley, Hopper or Matt Damon. What I can say though is that the two actors paint completely different characters. In my personal opinion, Damon triumphs effortlessly. What I appreciated about Damon was that he created a character that was cunning and manipulative but was drenched in self-loathing and insecurities; so much so that he came across as likable and sympathetic, thus adding to his mysterious draw on the people around him. Hopper plays Ripley like a cold hearted psychopath. It's apparent from the moment he steps on the screen that he is gruff and cold. Thankfully this film focuses on Zimmermann and thus Hopper is really not on the screen all that much.In the end I recommend `Der Amerikanische Freund'. It is a strong study of human nature and it creates a mood of suspense even when nothing suspenseful is taking place. The subway murder scene alone is a perfect example of flawless filmmaking, a scene that is slow and brooding and steals the audience's heartbeats one by one. The film is not as polished or as masterfully constructed as `The Talented Mr. Ripley' but it delivers the goods regardless. While the ending is a tad over-the-top and a little confusing I still felt rewarded after turning the film off. Don't expect to understand everything right off the bat, and there are some facets of the plot that you may never fully understand (I guess it's time to read that novel) but Wenders and company create a satisfying thriller that gets under your skin and into your head.",

Dennis Hopper is the American friend although the movie pretty much belongs to Bruno Ganz who plays the quiet picture framer Jonathan Zimmerman with a blood disease. Hopper convinces him to take out an enemy of a Frenchman Gerard Blain in a Paris subway. Then there is the pivotal scene in a train lavatory where the best laid plans go awry. The film is set in Hamburg, Paris and New York. Hopper in really an engaging and good performance plays Ripley as a crude American who often wears a cowboy hat, a far cry from Matt Damon (\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\", John Malkovich (\"Ripley's Game\") and Alain Delon (\"Purple Noon\"), all of whom play the character as an urbane sophisticate (while Damon starts out as a novice to culture, he is certainly a fast learner).The cinamatography works very well here, giving the viewer atmospheric shots of Hamburg as well as some interesting closeups, for instance, the frames of TV monitors that catch Zimmerman fleeing from the subway after committing the murder.Highsmith novels continue to engage film directors. Since she has many more novels that have yet to be made into movies, we can only hope other directors take up the Ripley story soon.",

    "review/text": "THE AMERICAN FRIEND is a clever film, but one that perhaps suffers from a being a little too smart for its own good. As an exploration of the cultural colonisation of Germany it is very effective, and WIM WENDERS fills the subtext of his film with a pessimistic tone that borders on paranoia, a redolent theme for a film of the 1970's. He depicts a featureless and grey Europe that is bending under the unbearable yolk of capitalism. A continent that has had its originality squeezed out of it by the duplicitous behaviour of people like Tom Ripley. A land of commerce and greed, rather than art. In fact art becomes the metaphorical device for the insidiousness of a consumer driven society, with both painting and the cinema acting as its agents. Of all European countries to feel the pinch of forced doctrines by the USA, Germany in the wake of WW2 is perhaps the most notable. A generation of film-makers grew up with an ambivalent attitude towards Hollywood. They were respectful of its efficiency, but resentful of its corrupt value system and sought to implement their own brand of national cinema. THE AMERICAN FRIEND and to a lesser degree Werner Herzog's STROSZEK are the most indicative examples of these complex tensions. Viewed today the film also becomes an intricate and enjoyable parody of film noir and the values that genre embodied. It's post-modern credentials are worn as a badge, in both Wenders choices of colour, and especially in the casting. As a deconstruction of both Hollywood's influence and the effects of forced capitalism THE AMERICAN FRIEND works tremendously well. Unfortunately the sophistication of its satirical elements, wring a great deal of the life out of the film, especially in terms of excitement and spectacle.",

    "review/text": "Plunge a character into a world that is unknown and completely foreign to them and watch as their world comes crashing down around their ankles-this is the plot that outlines _The American Friend_ . Mr. Ripley, played here by Dennis Hopper, is a man who deals with art forgeries and, quite oddly, schemes to involve a stranger named Jonathan Zimmermann (played by Bruno Ganz) in a series of murders. Things go splendidly until Jonathon starts to unwind. Despite Zimmermann's hopes to provide for his family, his involvement with Mr. Ripley's associates only leads to the destruction of his family and his way of life. Slow at times, _The American Friend_ is a film that gains most of its appeal from the richness of the characters. I was particularly impressed with Bruno Ganz's performance, as he manages to establish a strong character and completely distintegrate throughout the film gradually. His performance is so strong that one gets the impression that the film was shot in sequence-the continuity is that good. Dennis Hopper is also strong in his role as the querky Mr. Ripley (a completely different portrayal than the recent Matt Damon rendition), though I was not drawn to his character when opposite of Ganz. Of course, Hopper's character does not really enter the film in any significant way until he has decided to befriend a man he has already doomed, but I still expected a little more from the young Hopper.Though slow at times due to the action-film turned character piece (often said to be a thriller with no thrills), _The American Friend_ has more than enough suspense to keep an audience going when it is at its best.

And yet Wender, in an interview I saw, in his thickly accented but otherwise perfect English, said, \"Rock und Roll safed my life.\"Wender has always been resolutely apolitical in the kinds of films he makes, but his camera does not lie, and for that reason, his movies are charged with political questions that are deeply human and personal, and make me think more about what I believe.",

    "review/text": "It's in many ways not fair to entitle this film as just a film noir.I state that because , first at all remember. we are talking about of Patricia Highsmith , one of the most gifted minds in the north american literatute. If you analyze all her literaries works, as Strangers on a train,(Hitchcock) or A plenn soleil(Rene Clement), you'll find all the characters are envolved in a cosmical trick. It's true that the hopeless who surrounds establishes an anticipated fate in all their actions. But what Highsmith adds in every work, including the american friend is the lack of any kind of feeling or ethical consideration carried to a level that they become in models. I mean, it's very hard for us to find by instance, with a character as Mr. Rippley in any street of any city in the world. These characters are not common.That's the most remarkable virtue in Highsmith and Wenders so Clement and Hithcock understood and exploited this item like few.Wenders,one of the three kings of the german filmography in the seventies, (together with Fassbinder, Herzog, and Hauff), knew how to deal with that and make a clever twist in an age where the key works of the neo film noir, a genre that slowly was left and replaced by thrillers with little trascendence.This film , in my point of view, made grow up to Dennis Hopper, not only as actor, but as a filmmaker. (Remember his best work as director titled Colors).This film is eternal. And that means just one thing: it's a masterpiece. And obviously, it will resist the years and far of getting old, it will enrich us, every time we watch it.",

    "review/text": "Patricia Highsmith (who died in 1995) ranks as one of the most accomplished yet recondite writers of fiction to emerge from the United States in this century. Graham Greene, in a forward to a collection of her short stories, referred to her as &quot;the poet of apprehension.&quot; Unfortunately, although a number of her novels have been adpated for the screen, beginning with Hitchcock's &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; and most recently in Anthony Minghella's bastardized &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, these attempts have almost exclusively been of a mediocre and inchoate standard. Wim Wender's 1977 film &quot;Der Amerikanische Freund&quot; is an overwhelming exception. Though the locations and plot lines of the original novel (third in the Ripley series) was substantially altered, Wenders was able to capture the essential character of the books two unlikely protaganists. Hopper's Ripley is brimming over with unstated homoerotic menace, while Ganz plays the naive and desperate Jonathan to perfection. The central attribute of a Highmsith novel is not a feeling of suspense so mauch as one of delocalized discomfort, unease that has no rational causal locus. Combine this with the film's aesthetic sensibility, the use of strong and unnatural filters to carnivalize the vision of seagulls soaring lazily over a Hamburg dawn, the effervescent green light of a paris metro station, and you have something no less than a low-key masterpiece.",

    "review/text": "One of the best adaptations of a Patricia Highsmith novel (*Ripley's Game*) ever filmed, and one of Wim Wenders' best movies, too. But, according to the commentary on this DVD, Ms. Highsmith was originally aghast at Wenders' treatment of the story -- it's a very loose adaptation -- and of the character Tom Ripley (Dennis Hopper in a cowboy hat, a figure radically different from the suave manipulator in the book). As the years passed, she apparently grew reconciled to the movie on its own terms, and why not? -- the themes of the seductiveness of evil and of the abyss yawning below any \"normal\" person's life are rigorously limned in *The American Friend*. And Wenders brings some ideas of his own to this material, most notably the distasteful spectacle of a dominant world power and culture (e.g., the United States) crassly pirating the leavings of an older civilization (e.g., European): a way of life and thought, even a fraudulent version of it, is available to the highest bidder only. Above and beyond the intellectual stuff, the movie also happens to have several suspenseful stretches. Best example: the scene where the modest picture-framer from Hamburg (a never-better Bruno Ganz), having been roped into being a hitman due to the machinations of an insulted Tom Ripley, ineptly tails an American gangster through the subterranean Paris metro. Ganz needs the money for his family, but he's in bad health (a heart condition), and can barely stay alert while fighting anxiety attacks and physical exhaustion. Great stuff! Also of note is a prolonged and quite humorous assassination attempt aboard a speeding bullet train. (Hopper and Ganz share swigs from a flask and giggle at each other while guarding the murder scene -- the lavatory -- from discovery.) Wenders and his brilliant DP, Robby Muller, add to the atmosphere of malaise with the judicious use of pulpy color, blinding carnival-esque neon, and garish camera filters (blood-red skies at sunset and such). As for the performances: Hopper's Ripley really doesn't come alive until the last stretch, when he's given more time to work through his performance. Part of the problem is that the character -- in this movie -- is more of an idea rather than a fleshed-out human being. This is Bruno Ganz' movie all the way, and he makes the most of it. It's an unforgettable performance. It's a pretty unforgettable movie, on the whole. [The DVD's commentary, by Wenders and Hopper, is almost worth the price of admission on its own. It's enjoyable to listen to two old pros whose careers are full of accomplishments . . . one of which, of course, is *The American Friend*.]",

    "review/text": "The first chilling moment in this film is when relatively poor and struggling art framer and cultured European (Swiss) Bruno Ganz is introduced to art dealer American (Dennis Hopper)) Tom Ripley at an art auction, and refuses to shake his hand. From that moment, Mr Ganz is more or less doomed. One theme of this film is the clash between two cultures, or at least two attitudes to art, money versus art, the contempt each has for the other. Another theme is how thrilling it would be to kill anyone who makes a fool of us in public. From the moment of the slight, the doomed Mr Ganz is slowly brought to his end - the mis en scene becomes a horror show of ordinary things made threatening, seagulls, art frames he works on he starts bumping into, a television set which is off zaps him with static electricity when he touches it, he stumbles in to objects whilst waiting for a train, the doodling on a piano by a &quot;medical student&quot; gangster becomes an atonal nightmare. The moment when Mr Ganz breathes onto the finest piece of gold leaf we can see him realising the breath of life is so precious, but he's losing it and he knows it.A stunning cinematic experience. A masterpiece and perhaps the finest transformation of Ms Highsmith's many Ripley adaptations, notwithstanding Mr Hitchcock.",

    "review/summary": "Neo-noir, the cultural outsider, and the cult of personality",
    "review/text": "The American Friend is a particularly trenchant example of Wim Wenders' favorite theme--the outsider in a different culture (cf. The Buena Vista Social Club--Ry Cooder in Havana; Until the End of the World--William Hurt's American character in Europe). Only in this case, the outsider, Dennis Hopper--the American friend--ruins the life of the insider, played by Bruno Ganz.But that's what noir is all about. Based on one of the Ripley novels by American ex-patriate author Patricia Highsmith (no doubt her ex-pat status appealed to Wenders), the film follows Jonathan Zimmermann (Ganz) in his descent into Noirville via Tom Ripley (Hopper) and Ripley's &quot;partner&quot; Minot, a sinister French man. This time out, unlike in the 1960 film Purple Noon (THE best cinematic version of Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley--far better than the recent version with Matt Damon), Ripley is an edgy guy (what else could Hopper be?--especially in 1977 when he was coked to the gills) who deals in art forgeries.Along the way we meet an artist who does the forgeries, and that's famed director Nicholas Ray in a great role. Ray is one of Wenders' heroes--maybe his biggest hero--and he's here in his glory--sad single eye partnered with his trademark eyepatch, gaunt face and all. Three years later, Ray died of cancer. We also meet a gangster played by another of Wenders' favorite directors, Samuel Fuller. But Fuller's part is smaller than Ray's, which says something...This is a perfect exemplar of the road to Hell being paved with good intentions. Zimmermann's one desire to take care of his family results in his being coerced into dark deeds that ultimately leave Zimmermann emotionally destitute.Wenders' focus is on the characters who make things happen, who bring about the downfall of both themselves and of others. While American neo-noirs can occasionally do a great job of focusing on action-driven plots--given a great writer/director team--in this film, Wenders chooses instead to have the story unfold based on personalities.An unusual and strong neo-noir, The American Friend is a unique film that is a key work in the Wenders oeuvre. Great job (an American expression).",

What really bothers me is when a director simply transplants the exact contents of a book to the screen, as in the Harry Potter films and numerous other adaptations of best-sellers. Gone with the Wind and Clockwork Orange have considerable alterations but that's what makes them great films without taking anything away from the source material. It takes a brave and talented director to actually improve on a great book, as is the case with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Judge The American Friend on it's own merits and leave the book on the shelf.",

The brilliant acting by Dennis Hopper, Bruno Ganz and Gerard Blain on its own makes this a really memorable movie. Certainly, this is Dennis Hopper at his most edgy, something he does well and in my opinion this is his most outstanding performance ever. Ganz is convincing as an honest and reasonable man trying to make the most of a bad situation. Likewise, Blain is a joy to watch in his role as the smooth professional fixer calling the shots.I'm not sure if the movie could be said to have a \"Hitchcock\" influence, but I would say that those who like Hitchcock may well enjoy this. It combines mystery, great camera work and a dark film noir plot with a sound track reminiscent of a Hitchcock movie. The movie also has a black humour to it as Ganz and Hopper bungle their way through the murderous business of doing away with various criminals. The second train sequence for example is an absolute hoot and you could easily be watching a Tarintino movie. Overall, this is one of my favourite films and while it is certainly quirky it stands out as being rather unique.",

Though both actors have personified the role, it is in this film's final fight that I finally got to see Jet Li's bout at Drunken Boxing for my first time ever (thus the review's title).

Plus, Yuen &quot;you only wish you could choreograph action like me&quot; Woo-Ping offers us a shot at Fei-Hung delving into Chicken Style against a ten-man centipede, plus numerous other wire-fu goodies that'll put a stoned grin onto any viewers face.No real special features on the disc to even mention save the inherent but ever-necessary widescreen, but then again I own the HK version.

Fei Hung is running out of money, cant afford his studio, so his star pupils Ah-so and Ah-fu make a deal with some landlord for leasing a building for dirt cheap, they later find out that the owner of the building is a pimp, and his whore house is right next door, overlooking the grounds of the studio. I want tell you anything else, and theres a lot more to see, but ill tell you that its funny. The martial arts is pretty good, and if you guys are MA fans, then I should tell you that Gordon &quot;Master Killer&quot; Liu is in this also. Yeah, thats right, the log on water riding master himself.So if you guys are looking for a good laugh (at the comedy, not poor attempt at a movie) then this movie is definitely it. It has its serious moments too, after all its about Fei Hung. It has good MA action, from what I remember, i mean i watched it twice. The characters are cool, but the cast that plays them is excellent. The villain, is awesome. He's evil as hell! Certifiably insane!I dont know what else to say about it, its a really good movie, i thought it was better than Once Upon A Time in China 2, (not OUATIC I, i said II). The whores were funny. I only wish they showed more of Leung Man, she was bad boy. She had this one scene, man, shes good (by the way, shes not one of the whores)4 stars, go get it. If youre into Jet Li, or are wandering if you really like his style of acting and MA, then get this movie, he'll impress you, he is afterall a Kung Fu master.",

    "review/text": "For those buying this Deadly China Hero dvd, you are getting a [junky] version of the original film Last Hero In China. The distributors for Deadly.. are known for bootleggin movies and cutting scenes out, so look for the right one if you intend to check this film out. This film is the Jet's second to the last installment to the Once Upon A Time In China (OUATIC) series. It's nothing spectacular in my opinion, but it's not a bad film either. Tsui Hark, who did the original OUATIC series is not a part of this film; instead, the dirty Wong Jing directed this film, which kind of hurt it a bit. Yuen Woo Ping still provided the choreography, but I've seen better. Wong's aunt, or love interest, (Rosamund Kwan) is also out of this picture. Jet plays Wong Fei Hung once again, and he moves his school temporarily to a new location. The school ends up next to a brothel, Fei Hung soons discovers corruption and kidnappings of women taking place around the town. Officials want to get rid of him, and of course Wong wants to save everybody as usual. This is probably all you'd need to know about the story because it really is not that interesting. Right from the start, I could not take this film seriously at all. It was trying pretty hard to be funny, and sometimes it worked, other times it failed miserably. It felt like watching a parody of OUATIC. The MA were good, but not great; there was simply too much wirework and fake elements involved. It's one thing if the movements look real, but wirework was pretty bad in this film. There's a scene where a bad official slaps his hands on tiles, and this brings them up flying at Wong; all of a sudden the official decides to literally swim or glide across the ground afterwards...couldn't help thinkin what was the point of it was, but anyways. The bad official (Alan Chui?) also has one of the most annoying laughs you'll ever hear. There were bits and pieces of battles that stood out, but not one ENTIRE fight scene impressed me. The Shaolin Master Killer Gordon Liu(Lau Kar Fai) was also in the film as a bad guy, but director Wong Jing clearly wasted Liu's talents by not using them. In addition, the outcome of his final battle is pretty pathetic. There is a fight between Liu and Jet that starts off decent until the flying elements came into play...sigh...like I said, bits and pieces. Cheung Man is also in the film, but her MA is strictly wire based and made her look like a ballerina...nothing impressive. As everyone already mentioned here, the last battle involves Jet in a chicken suit fighting a group of baddies dressed as a centipede. It's kind of silly, but the battle that follows between Fei Hung and the bad official is nice. There is still wirework done here, but this battle probably had the most REAL and serious MA. Sadly, there were many shots that made me realize that Jet was doubled for many of the sequences...sigh...you'll also see Jet try to use the drunken style, though unconvincing, and some great moves came afterwards and probably is the base of my rating. Some of the moves here are pretty brutal, and they stayed in my mind even after the film. Overall, I would call this an average movie. OUATIC 1-3 totally outshines this film because there was more meaning to it and I felt more for the characters, plus the MA was far better. I can't really recommend you to buy this film, but since it is pretty cheap, why not. Besides, it's part of Jet's Wong Fei Hung history. It's definitely worth checking out, so you can make your own opinions. To me, this film is trying too hard to be funny, and sadly I found myself laughing at scenes in the film that probably weren't intended to be funny. Better Jet films are his original OUATIC 1-3, Fist of Legend (his best), Swordsman II, Tai Chi Master, Kung Fu Colt Master, Shaolin Temple, and more...hope this was helpful, check out my other MA reviews, thanks for reading.",

    "review/text": "though not as good as the once upon a time series, it's still a pretty good movie, because it throughs humor into the mix. if you've seen deadly china hero it basically the same but last hero in china has 1 or 2 extra scenes, but it's something you really don't notice because it doesn't effect the plot of the movie. They even have one of my all time favorites Gordon Lui(he's a bad guy this time though) i recommend this version on dvd for two reasons first it's Jet Li, so you know you're getting great fight scenes, (even though his drunken boxing wasn't as good as when Jackie Chan played Wong Fei Hong in Drunken Master 2) and secondly because the Deadly China Hero dvd is the worst dvd i have in my collection, it's worst than anything i have on my vhs collection as well. So if you have seen any of the once upon a time in china series i suggest you give this one a chance to see Jet Li play a light hearted version of the man that made him internationaly known",

    "review/text": "Before reading this review you should know that this film is the same movie as &quot;Last Hero in China.&quot;This film is, as the title of this article proclaims, an interesting combination. Combination of what, you ask? It is a combination of the Historic Chinese Martial Arts extravaganza and a Tom Green movie. What makes the film interesting is that the combination is not as bad as it sounds. Jet Li once agains plays the role of Wong Fei Hung, as he did in the Once Upon A Time in China historical epics, but this Fei Hung is a very different character from the more serious Fei Hung (particularly in the first OUATIC) we are used to.In essence this film takes the fairly standard school versus school and style versus style conflict and extends it to a Dragon dancing competition (mirrors of OUATIC here, but wait) with Jet Li's masterful Dragon dancing interrupted by a villain in a Millipede suit. Jet Li loses the initial competition, due to various circumstances which include the villain's nepharious influence. Jet Li recovers and battles the Millipede in a Chicken Suit in the final battle. Chicken suit? Yes, a chicken suit. I told you there was a touch of Tom Green in this movie, or is it Adam Sandler? Doesn't matter.Typical of the Jet Li/Wong Jing pairing films this is a less than serious affair. If you go in expecting wonderful wuxia wire-fu and a few laughs in a no budget free for all you will have a great time. Jet Li is an amazing martial artist and somehow this film works. But if you've come looking for Fist of Legend you are in for a serious shock in this film.",

    "review/text": "This movie is perhaps one of the zaniest kung fu movies I've seen. There's men in drag, Cartoony fight scenes, and of course, Jet Li dressed up as a chicken fighting a giant centepede.One of the good things about this movie, is that the fight scenes are very original. There aren't any ones with two guys standing in an open area facing off in a cliche fight scene. There's a fight scene where Jet Li never gets out of the chair he's sitting in. There's also one where he's holding onto a bouquet of flowers and one handedly defeats three goons. The best fight scene is the final show down between Jet li and Gorden Liu. Jet Li performs an amazing Drunken Boxing technique which is far better than Jackie Chan's in Drunken Master.Another good thin about this movie is that allthough they use excessive wire stunts, many of them are still beleivable and actually contribute to the fight scenes. The end fight scene, where Li comically bounces off walls and lands on ropes must have used wires, but doesn't look fake at all. There are however some scenes where the special effects are horrible and unnessessary. For example there is a fight scene where Jet Li lifts his leg and kicks someone behind him in the face, and they use a fake leg that looks like it should be attached to a muppet.Another Problem with this movie is the plot and subtitles. The plot has something to do with the opium wars, Wong Fei Hung trying to start a new school, and women being stolen and sold as prostitutes, but that's the best I can do to summarize the plot. What makes the plot so hard to follow is partially the fact that there's a plot turn every ten minutes. However the biggest problem is the sub titles. Many Hong Kong movies have a tendency to have subtitles which are in white and are displayed over the movie instead of underneath it or in a box. This makes it impossible to read half of the subtitles because they are in white writing over a white picture such as most of the characters' shirts.This movie is pretty good. It has very creative and impressive fight scenes. However there are some shortcomings in the special effects and storyline.",

Wong is a doctor and martial arts master of Hung's Fist in Canton. After defeating 3 branch leaders of the Boxers Association, he comes home to find that Po Chi Lam is too small. So he moves his Po Chi Lam, unaware that it is next to a brothel. He is also engaged in a fight with a loose criminal in a corrupt police officer's place. He only stays in his chair and displays some great leg-work. After he finds out that he resides next to a brothel, he loses face, but later he finds himself fighting with the Nun-yan temple's leader, an expert in Shaolin Fist. Nun-yan temple kidnaps young women to sell them to Southeast Asia to get enough money and to expand its power. After injuring some 46 monks and beating the leader, the police officer puts him in a trial, but is luckily saved by his neighbors. He then performed for Mr. Sasin with his lion dance troup, but is defeated by a centipede. He is now deaf. After he is cured by a father and daughter group, he sees a chicken fighting a centipede. Later, dressed as a chicken, he defeats the centipede, then, using Drunken Fist, defeated the corrupt police officer.",

    "review/text": "But if you are a HUGE HUGE HUGE fan of Jet Li playign wong fei-hung, like I am, then this will be a VERY funny movie for you.The story starts out with a some outlaws being chased by the government, and these guys are pretty tough. One of the guys took a guard by the head and threw his body onto like a shelf or something and the guys body cripples in half like he was holding a pillow.You are going to get a lot of that type of action. I am a HUGE fan of the old school peking style that Lau Kar Leung used, I love the hand to hand. And while you don't get too much of that, you get enough and the stunt are really cool.Now my favorite part of this movie are the ones where he has this CRAZY general talking to Wong, I can't even explain the way the guy was acting, it was sow eird and it was also kinda cool. So Jet is sitting in a chair and the general is asking to see his kung fu skills and the general is so close to the face(on purpose of course) to Jet's face you can just see how great of an actor for making it this whole scene without busting out laughing. CAUSE THE GENERAL WAS THE MAN, HE IS THE ONE WHO MAKES THIS MOVIE FUNNY, JUST TRY TO TELL ME THAT THIS IS NOT THE GREATEST VOICE ACTING JOB IN THE HISTORY OF DUBBING, but I will get back to this when I tell you the dvd that you should seek out.So I don't want to give the story away cause it's not that great but very very funny.So like I said in another review of this, remove everything you knew about the OUATIC series except leave wong as a serious guy. Then make everything that happens around him just a strait up slap stick comedy and see how wong react, it is absolutely hilarious.Now I wanna go over some of the reasons you should see this movie.WONG FEI-HUNG VS. MASTER KILLER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Beardy and bucktooth reunited, to know about this you have to go 11 years before this film was made and watch legend of a fighter. It is my favorite MA movie EVER, and I have a review on this on the vhs side under secret master. The chemistry was absolutely beautiful in that movie.IF YOU ARE A FAN OF JET LI, THEN I SHOULD GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU THIS IS MY 2ND FAV JET LI AS WONG MOVIE EVER. so in other words I rate it #2 out of the 5 he was in.BUT I ALSO RATE THIS MOVIE ABOVE LEGEND 1 AND 2, ENFORCER, EVIL CULT, KISS OF THE DRAGON, OK I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE LISTED THE ONES I LIKE MORE INSTEAD CAUSE THIS IS LIKE A TOP 3 JET MOVIE FOR ME.I'm not a fan of most of of Jing Wong's stuff, but this one I feel is one of his better efforts, ALSO JET'S ACTING PERFORMANCE IN THIS RIVALS THE 1ST OUATIC MOVIE. SO DEFINITELY ONE OF HIS BEST ACTING JOBS.Now the dvd that I have is 105 MINUTES LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i mean it wass almost too freaking long for me, now how often does that happen in kung fu. How many people said in secret rivals like oh I wish they would have cut out some of the training sequences or that funny part could have gone or the final fight could have been a bit shorter? The version that I have is from Red Sun. It is full screened but the movie has a very good picture and the full screened seriously does not even affect anything!SO OVERALL A VERY WEIRD MOVIE AND YEAH JUST VERY WEIRD. BUT DEFINITELY FOR ANY JET LI FAN, SO PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME TO SEEK THIS OUT AND DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION, CAUSE IT SI NOTHING BUT BAD REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Also the sountrack to this is the freaking shiznit.",

Okay, if you happen to be a fan of, say, Kieslowski, you may perk up at this point, but this is not that sort of film. Like \"Three Colours: Blue\", it never shies away from the pain of grieving. Unlike that film, it also has a completely berserk sense of the ridiculous.The siblings themselves are the pious elder brother Thomas, his sceptical younger brother Michael, sister Sheila who has cerebral palsy (I don't know if Rosemarie Stephenson, who plays Sheila, actually _has_ cerebral palsy - but whether she does or not, she's truly extraordinary) and hothead college-boy John. The story takes place during the night before the funeral, and the morning of the funeral itself, and it gets going in brutal style with a nasty fight in a pub. It goes on to include a plaster statue of the Virgin Mary being shattered on a church floor, a disastrous attempt to scare someone who happens to be jerking off at the time, the most malevolent bar-owner in cinema history, and a church roof being torn off in a thunderstorm.\"Orphans\" is one of the very few films to approach the insanity and awful comedy of grief, the way that messy life insists on intruding upon your own private despair. Mullan's script is ruthlessly truthful, his direction is unfailingly inventive and daring, and the film manages to be the product of a truly unholy schtup between Robert Bresson and the Weitz brothers. The cast is uniformly excellent, with special frond-type things going to the four leads, Douglas Henshall, Gary Lewis, Stephen McCole and Rosemarie Stephenson. It also has a sort-of cameo by Billy Connolly, of all people, as an unseen, absent God.Filmmaking doesn't get much darker, funnier or wiser than this. Do yourself a favour and check it out.",

    "review/text": "Dad's long dead and mum just died. The three sons and their wheelchair bound sister need to get her into the ground. Sounds straightforward enough, but events that transpire at the pub after the wake send everything whirling into a tailspin and, things get so out of control, one wonders if they'll ever get back on track.Many have noted this as a dark comedy. True enough, but it's so dark, I'm thinking one needs to create a new category of film. Yes. Some of the things that happen here are darkly funny, but others are just plain dark. This is way off beat but not at all out of the realm of believability. Most of it lies in how the characters treat one another, and how, what they might do to each other in one scene has nothing to do with how they might treat each other in the next. In one scene a family is taking in the wheelchair bound sister. They luckily have a ramp in their complex which was built for their elderly neighbor. Said neighbor scolds them and says they cannot use \"her ramp.\" They tell her to bugger off and use it anyway. Later that night a storm hits, knocks out the power and said neighbor needs to go to them for refuge. They accept her with no questions asked. I somehow don't see that happening with most people.There are so many odd things happening here you simply have to see it to believe it. Each of the sons (and their sister) embark on these Odysseys that put them through emotional wringers and bring each of them to the brink. The story has an arc as do each of the characters. One of the joys for the viewer is to see where each of them ends up.This is an excellent film. The writing is good. The characters are good. Thankfully, the producers saw fit to subtitle it. As it is a Scottish film, the brogue is so thick I would have been lost without them. The only drawback is that I wish it had been shot a bit better.

    "review/text": "Peter Mullan makes a mighty impressive debut as writer/director of a feature length, here with \"Orphans.\" Wisely eschewing the Hollywood formula Mullan presses onward with the tale of four siblings dealing with the death of their beloved mother, confining almost every minute of screentime into the eve and day of the funeral. The tale veers from the blackest comedy to heart tugging truths about the connectedness of family, of rage and sorrow, fear and rivalry, misplaced feelings, illness and acceptance. It goes to a lot of other places as well.Any film that has a church's roof ripped and hurling off into a gale force wind, a Madonna crashing from a hit by a motorized wheelchair, a bartender who, literally, takes hostages for petty offenses (like reading his newspaper), a man who sees the positive aspect of nearly being stabbed to death (hey, if he can convince work authorities it was a work related injury he will be \"compensated\") has grabbed my interest. In addition to the quartet of family at the story's core the film is populated with just enough believable wack-job locals to make the tale seem pretty universal, despite its very Scottish setting.The cast is uniformly excellent, each one believable and crucial to the storytelling. What a gem of a movie this is!",

I have been sewing since I was 8 and I'm now on Social Security. This IS supposed to be for someone who does not know how to sew at all. It met that purpose perfectly IMHO. One reviewer mentioned not being able to see the print on the back of the pattern. All patterns look the same on the back. Knowing what each section was for is the object, not being able to read THAT specific pattern. The one thing I did like, specifically, is that this DVD gives me the chance to view it with the GK and while it is playing, teach them things that I would do differently and why, i.e. wasting so much fabric on the skirt layout comes to mind. I am sorta gagging over the price of these DVDs in the series and may have to resort to looking in the library for the next levels or trying to rent them online. As I said, I'm on SS.",

    "review/text": "Having only watched the first season during its original run, I have practically no frame of reference from which to compare Season 9. Folks and friends have claimed that Season 9 actually isn't so bad compared to prior seasons, these pals of mine having stated that SMALLVILLE jumped the shark many years ago. Me, I simply was never invested in this version of Clark Kent, and, yeah, Tom Welling's wooden acting factors in big. A girlfriend once labeled Welling's acting as \"reserved,\" but let us not talk falsely now. It also doesn't sit well that the show is taking its sweet time with Clark's evolution to the Big Red S. I do think the move to Metropolis was a step forward. I won't go into the soap opera content. But Superman's got no business being in THE O.C.This ninth season revolves around several threads. Major Zod and his troop of fellow Kandorians have descended on Metropolis on a quest to turn Earth's yellow sun to red so that they could gain otherworldly abilities. The vacuously-named mystery man, the \"Red-Blue Blur,\" continues to protect Metropolis. Chloe Sullivan, who has developed into a darker character, is still trying to get the band together, the band, of course, projected as this reality's Justice League. Clark Kent and Lois Lane continue their cautious circling around each other. Intimacy is hard to achieve when both parties have built up so many defensive walls. I like what Erica Durance does with her character. Lois is appropriately spunky and obnoxious and vulnerable and lovable. And she never stops talking.What made me check out SMALLVILLE again after so long is the show's steady increase in featuring DC properties. I glommed onto Season 8 because of the \"Legion\" episode. Season 9 turned my head strictly because of the episode \"Absolute Justice,\" which by the way is gratifyingly excellent. It's no secret that SMALLVILLE is more an Elseworlds-type reality than a reflection of DC's ongoing continuity. As such, I do relish the changes invoked regarding these halfway familiar characters. And, as for Clark Kent himself, he's one step closer to putting on the flashy red and blue tights. If nothing else, that Season 10 is the final season seems to be galvanizing the writers to get a move on already. How much longer will they allow the Red-Blah-Blah to go around gigged out in an uber-lame black trench coat that even Neo thinks is played out?And what's a show like this without a covert organization mucking things up? The shadowy agency called Checkmate makes its debut, headed up by the calculating Amanda Waller (Pam Grier) and numbering Maxwell Lord as one of its agents. Checkmate is intent on countering some sort of impending alien invasion. It's pretty decent foreshadowing.I have several favorite episodes from Season 9, and these all involve SMALLVILLE's expanding its universe to explore its DC roots. \"Crossfire\" features Green Arrow's mentoring of soiled dove/cage fighter Mia Dearden (readers of Green Arrow's comic book know her as \"Speedy\"). \"Idol\" introduces the Wonder Twins, and I grinned real big when the twins bumped fists and said: \"Powers, activate!\" \"Warrior\" presents a twist on the Shazam! story and also the return of Zatanna.For JSA fiends \"Absolute Justice\" is must-see viewing. \"Absolute Justice\" is SMALLVILLE at its most comic-booky, with the added bonus of Geoff Johns having scripted the thing. It's neat to see the Justice Society treated with proper awe and reverence, and comic book fans will geek out on all the Easter eggs the episode throws in. Even Ma Hunkel gets a cameo. But I wasn't really sold until Dr. Fate spoke with that grand, solemn delivery of his. And while I did have reservations regarding Hawkman's costume (I thought the cuirass looked cheesy and the wings were a bit too stiff), I thought the winged wonder comes off really well. I don't know, though, that Carter Hall needed to channel Christian Bale's voice whenever he becomes Hawkman. Also, I enjoyed the instant rivalry that surfaced between Hawkman and Green Arrow (this being true to the comics, by the way). And I can't wait to see more of Star Girl. So, for now, I'm back in the fold and tuning in to Season 10. Maybe it's not too little too late, after all.SMALLVILLE - THE COMPLETE NINTH SEASON offers the following bonus material: audio commentary on the episodes \"Kandor\" (with actor Callum Blue and executive producers Turi Meyer and Al Septien) and \"Idol\" (with actress Erica Durance and executive producers Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson); Deleted/Unaired Scenes from 8 episodes: \"Rabid,\" Roulette,\" \"Disciple,\" \"Persuasion,\" \"Conspiracy,\" \"Upgrade,\" \"Charade,\" and \"Salvation\"; \"Kneel Before Zod\" - a featurette exploring the evolution of Superman's classic foe (00:15:12 minutes long); \"Absolute Justice: From Script to Screen\" - a featurette going into the process of marrying the JSA into the SMALLVILLE universe (00:29:28 minutes).",

Then you have the debut of the Justice Society of America and Checkmate, who are introduced in the highlighted Smallville movie called Absolute Justice, written by Geoff Johns who wrote the 8th season episode, Legion. It clearly blows away the 6th season episode, Justice. There are a couple of featurettes - one focusing on Zod and the other on the Justice Society of America. This is a set to have, along with seasons 8 and 10, because they lead into the Superman mythos.",

    "review/summary": "Season 9 is one of the best for Smallville!!!",
    "review/text": "It's hard to believe that this show has gone on for 9 years, but the writing and the acting just keep getting better. Just like the last season, Clark Kent is one step closer to his destiny as Superman. The big overarching plot this season was the threat of the Kandorians, led by Major Zod. Smallville fans will recognize the name, if not the rank, of the big bad guy. That's because he's a clone of the evil traitor who tried to overthrow Krypton around the time Kal-El (Clark) was born. So he's going to be the worst villian in Kryptonian history, maybe. It's the reoccuring Smallville theme of destiny and fate. If you are destined to do something, do you do it or make your own destiny? Clark has been told since season 1 that he is destined to be this great hero and champion and symbol of hope. Most of the main plots of every season are about Clark finding out about his destiny and what he does to either embrace it or fight against it. So it is with the bad guys. Lex Luthor is destined to be Superman's arch-enemy. So even though we saw 5-6 seasons of Lex trying to overcome his dark nature and maintain some kind of friendship with Clark, we knew he was eventually going to be bad. Same with Davis Bloome, aka Doomsday. He was trying to fight his nature of being the ultimate destroyer. But ultimately, he, too, had to succomb to his destiny. In this season, it is Zod. This \"Major Zod\" has not made all the bad choices that \"General Zod\" did back on Krypton. But we know what he is to become. Will he make the same choices or will he change his fate?The main highlights for me were the so-called \"filler\" episodes that focused more on Lois and Clark's budding relationship than on the threat of the Kandorians. What I like about the writing is the continual shout-outs to fans of Superman, comics, and TV/Movies. Like the \"Resident Evil\" episode (#3 Rabid), the \"What a Woman Wants\" episode (#4 Echo), \"the Game\" episode (#5 Roulette), the \"He said/She said\" episode (#6 Crossfire), and the \"Big\" episode (#12 Warrior). For comic book fans, they converted an old Hawkeye story for Green Arrow (#10 Disciple) and brought Metallo, Silver Banshee, and the JSA all into the Smallville story.Something must be said about the black costume. Clark has embraced his heroic destiny by saving people, just not openly. So he is no longer the \"Red-Blue Blur\", just \"the Blur\". The Black costume represents his keeping to the shadows. When he finally reveals himself to the world as \"Superman\", he will likely change his costume into the red, blue, and gold costume we are familiar with. He's close, but not quite there yet.As with any long running show, there are elements that some people don't like. Some people dislike the unique elements where Smallville differs from regular Superman lore. They want the show to move faster towards the classic tales that we know and love. Others dislike rehashing the old Superman mythos and want Smallville to remain true to the unique stories they created and not cave to pressure to become \"the Adventures of Superman\" or \"Lois and Clark\". I think Season 9 balances those two viewpoints well. Fans of the show will enjoy most, if not all of it. And if you haven't watched Smallville before, go back and watch all previous 8 seasons. It is well-worth the investment of time and money.",

It's just fun watching them together. Chloe and Oliver have great chemistry, as well..I'm liking it. :)You know, whether or not Clark wears the tights and red cape and flies is really up to the writers, and I have read somewhere that if and when this happens, it will be at the end of Season 10...can't wait!! Tom Welling, is the PERFECT Clark Kent...he's big and strong, and has the perfect looks...actually, he's one of the most beautiful men to ever walk the earth.I hate that the bashers, with 1 star ratings, have brought Smallville's ratings down....it's an AMAZING show with absolutely AMAZING actors...ZOD, TESS, OLIVER, LEX, LIONEL, MARTHA, JOHN...I could go on and on.As I said, I can't WAIT for Season 10. A lot of characters will be returning and lot's of good (and bad) things happening...it should be good, fun entertainment, and well deserving of a 5-Star rating!",

    "review/summary": "Clark's Darkest Hour and Kandor Survives-Smallville's Complete Ninth Season",
    "review/text": "Season Review:After quite probably the most disappointing finale of the series (\"Doomsday\") Fans and especially myself, wondered where the series would go from here. Season 8 showed a lot of quality and promirise, ultimately ending in mediocrity. Thankfully with \"Savior\", the writers picked up the series after another slump and fans quickly realized we might be in for an awesome season and was it ever. With Season 8 being a light-hearted, hopeful season, Season 9 explored Clark taking a darker turn as Metropolis' protector. Ditching the red and blue and simply be called \"The Blur\", we saw a more proactive and driven Clark then we've ever seen before. Not to mention, he made himself a costume and while most will agure about it's Matrix/the Punisher knock-off appeal, the fact that Clark was finally wearing the House of El symbol on his chest showed a significant amount of growth and change in the character. Not to mention, it's just epic!With Lana Lang days officially behind us (thank God!), Clark's relationship with Lois as well as Lois herself were given much more development this season than previous. While we got some great Clois interaction in Season 8, Season 9 finally saw the iconic duo in a relationship and luckily, the witty banter and amazing chemistry between Tom Welling and Erica Durance never waivered nor weakened because of it. If anything, it made their relationship more mature, complex and a lot more interesting than Clark and Lana's tiresome back and forth romance. It was great having Lois officially claiming her spot as Superman's leading lady as well as having her be the center of the story arc for a good portion of the season. During the first half, Lois returns with horrifying visions from being sent to the future and everyone is curious to see just what exactly the future holds, especially a worried Clark who was told by Alia, a kryptonian assassin from the future, that he would destory the world. It's an intriguing and exciting storyline that ultimately ends in the rather average futuristic epic \"Pandora\". While the visuals are strong, the conclusion of this part of the season's arc was lacking in execution and only added to some irritating plotholes.The return of Zod, while had most dreading his re-appearence, soon had everyone picked in interest again after Callum Blue's commanding performance as the future villain in the premiere. Callum really brought a lot of passion and presence to the role that hasn't been seen in a villain since the Lex/Lionel days. Watching this Major Zod develop into the villain we knew from Superman II was fun to watch as well as Zod's nemesis interplay with Tess. Cassidy Freedman returns as villainess heiress to the Luthor dynasty and this time her motives are more blurry than before. Tess spends most of the season playing both sides, which was entertaining in some episodes and just plain annoying in others. Nevertheless, the inconsistency of writing for the character was made up by Cassidy's solid performances. Justin Hartley returns as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, this time more emo than last season's first half. While Hartley does well with the material, the first few episodes watching Oliver's depression quickly grow tired and repetitive. The dark oliver arc concludes in the ridiculously concieved \"Roulette\" yet only to be brought back in yet \"been there, done that\" episode, \"Disciple\". Oliver also in the wake of his new awakening takes up in apprentice in Mia Dearden aka Speedy #2. While Mia is a decent enough character, she is ultimately underused and underwritten in the episodes she appears in (\"Crossfire\" and \"Disciple\") Other weak links in the season was the cartoony and embarassing episode \"Warrior\" which puts a Captain Marvel spin on the Warrior Angel comics of the series and tells a laugable tale with Chloe pratically hitting on a 12 year old boy turned cheesy superhero. Speaking of Chloe, she is the weakest aspect of the season in my opnion. Clark and Chloe developed some animosity between them during the season after the events of Season 8's finale, but it only further to make Chloe look bad because of it. Here actions at the end of last season left her with no consequences and it seems she was on a mission to gain a God complex with Watchtower, the new superhero operation developed by Chloe where heroes can call home as well as use it's technology to save the day, but Chloe only uses it for her personal motives to keep a watchful eye on everyone around her and gains a slef-righteous side where she doesn't trust Clark's decisions anymore. It's far cry from the Chloe we knew and loved from Season 5-7 and I couldn't mostly anything she did this season.But Season 9, despite all that, gave some of the best batch of Smallville episodes, storytelling, guest stars and developments in years. We're given an excellent villain birth in \"Metallo\", which tells the gruesome story of how John Corben became the kryptonite powered cyborg. Sarah Conner Chronicles/Beverly Hills 90210's Brian Austin Green is fantastic as Corben and is one of the series' most memorable villains. He returns with an even stronger performance in \"Upgrade\", if only the episode was a worthy sequel. Unlike the Doomsday arc which started off well and ended in contrivance, The Zod/Kandorians arc build at a steady pace, with some new development bringing a new twist to the storyline. Not to mention in the heroic and daring season 9 ender, \"Salvation\" all the season's arc conclude in a classic Smallville fashion including an iconic flashfoward, tremendous character development, amazing visuals, suspenseful cliffhangers and this time, a truly epic fight between Clark and Zod. Other memorable episodes are the terrific horror romance \"Rabid\", the Toyman sequel \"Echo\", the legendary kiss we've been waiting for in the lovely \"Crossfire\", Julian Sands gives a tour de force performance as Jor-El in the spectacular \"Kandor\", the Superman inspired \"Idol\", The stylized, action packed \"Checkmate\", the heartbreaking Lois and Clark episode \"Charade\", the suspensful, plot thickening \"Sacrifice\", Annette O Toole and Michael McKean return as Martha Kent and Perry White in the heartwarming back to basics(ish) episode \"Hostage\" and I can't forget to mention the 2 part movie event \"Absolute Justice\", which features the introduction of the Justice Society of America. It's a comic book epic like never before and utilizes the core cast of the series as well as it's guest stars Michael Shanks (Cart Hall/Hawkman), Britt Irvin (Courtney Whitmore/Stargirl) and Brent Strait (Kent Nelson/Dr. Fate) each breathed life into their respected chaarcters. We were also introduced to the villainous organization, Checkmate, lead by Amanda Waller, played by 70s icon Pan Grier. It was an good storyline left open ended toward the end of the season and hopefully we'll see more of Pam's diva(ish) take of the infamous comic book villainess and her governement empire.Season 9 is, in my opinion, the strongest season since the early years. We got more plot development from Clark, a better version of Zod, much more Superman inspired moments/dialogue and a stunning conclusion that left many fans anticipating the 10th and final season (which has just begun, \"Lazarus\" was great!)Rating-8.5/10Video and Audio:All 21 Season 9 episodes are presented in HD widescreen and the episodes looked so good, it felt like I was watching new episodes all over again! The audio was also great.Rating-8.5/10Extras:More effort was put into the special featurettes. We have two documentaries on Zod and Absolute Justice. Both were very in-depth, with great info on the characters comic book history and what they mean to the comics and the legend of Superman. Although, the commentaries were average, with Callum Blue giving decent commentary on 'Kandor\" and Erica Druance is pretty hilarious during the \"Idol\" commentary, but I would have loved a commentary on \"Hostage\" by Anette O Toole and Michael McKean and especially commentary by Greg Beeman and Tom Welling on \"Salvation\". But I guess not, sigh. Also the deleted scenes are worst then useless. All of them are worthless except for the ones for \"Conspiracy\".Rating-7.5/10Overall Rating: 8/10",

I'm sure Tom Welling would like to do other roles, though, and it will be interesting to watch his career.Season 9 found it's stride again after a less than stellar season 8. There were a few plot points I didn't understand, though. They never explained WHY the yellow sun did not affect Zod and crew the way it does Clark, and why the red sun would give them powers and take away Clark's. Maybe I just missed the reasoning, and I'll catch it whan I see the DVD.The Clark/Lois romance heats up in this season, and that's been fun. Lois, played beautifully by Erica Durance, begins to come into her own as a reporter, and as a woman. She wants a guy who is her own personal hero, but she's still distracted by the Blur.I wasn't crazy about the casing of the Zod character (apparently all Kryptonians have British accents and overact), but it was an interesting story line.And, true to form, the season ends in a big huge cliffhanger ... I've been worried about Clark all summer ... =)I hope this DVD set has more in the way of commentaries and extra features, esp gag reels, than some of the more recent seasons have had. That's my main reason for purchasing them, after all.KesterGayle",

I'm really glad there's going to be a 10th season, but I hope there will be more.The Lana drama is over since last season(two season to late). I really feel that she dragged the show down after a certain point, as her story became more about the men she dated and the drama associated with them.For me the show took on a new life, a fresher one this season. The Lois and Clark drama finally took full swing this season, something long awaited since season 4.All of the allusions to the comics are great. This is the show that led me into the rabbit hole of DC comics. I've seen nearly every single Superhero movie out there now. And I've read a good many comics starting at Identity Crisis.I hoped they would show more of the Justice League, and loved the Absolute Justice story line this season. The acting is fantastic. Such a great cast fueled this season, and I'm glad they're mostly coming back.",

    "review/text": "&#34;Smallville&#34; is one of my favorite shows to watch, and for 10 years, it is a show loaded with lessons and trials for one man to endure and to learn before becoming a symbol of hope for mankind. It's a show based on the well-famous comic book character, Superman, and it is a background to that man that we have come to love and look up to. Throughout the years, I would see aspects of myself in this boy as he'd go through many experiences and learning something from them, on the road to becoming a &#34;man.&#34; It is such an extraordinary series. I am also grateful for an introduction of Chloe Sullivan character to the DC Universe as she has provided such a powerful personality to Clark's inner circle.Now, the Ninth Season of &#34;Smallvile&#34; is considered to be a &#34;darkest&#34; aspect of the entire show where Clark began avoiding everyone that he ever cared about and trying to embrace his Kryptonian side (based on guilt), but he haven't fully comprehend the utmost importance of his connection with humanity. He began with &#34;There is no Clark Kent&#34; notion and became so one-sided to his personality, and he'd lose himself in that. It is obsessive, a single-minded way of dealing with things. He indeed is fooling himself. But, Lois has come back (from the future) and suddenly she isn't able to escape Clark's mind as his connection to her is so strong. In a way, she pulls him back to humanity. This season revealed another conflict within Clark and that is a struggle between being human and being Kryptonian. Zod, a clone of the real Zod, is a regular villain for this season and have an agenda for himself of being an egoistic tyrant. Also, Oliver Queen is struggling with his own personal demons and a drastic measure was taken to pull him back from the abyss. Jor-El returns in a human form, no longer a voice in the ice castle...even for a short while. A glimpse of a worse future when Zod ruled the world is revealed. A team of legendary Justice Society of America make their appearances. An introduction of a dangerous organization called &#34;Checkmate&#34; is demonstrated. And, evidently, the relationship between Clark and Lois will take its fruit.Clark's costume reflects this season as a hero who &#34;must&#34; remain in the shadows. It is black on black with a white &#34;S&#34; symbol on his chest. This could reflect a &#34;black-and-white&#34; thinking in Clark's mind and an inner conflict between human and Kryptonian sides (interesting how that reflects to the outer world: a war between the humans and the Kandorians).I felt that the Ninth season is the strongest point in the show's history before the final, and a great viewing of Clark's trials and lessons in his struggles between his two natures.After darkness comes the dawn...",

    "review/summary": "A new mythology for Earth's greatest super-hero!",
    "review/text": "Having watched this series faithfully since it began over 10 years ago, I was pleasantly surprised when they announced following Season 8 that Tom Welling had signed a contract to star and help produce Smallville for another 2 seasons. While the eighth season had its high points such as Geoff John's excellent \"Legion\" episode, they seemed off-balance without Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) and some of the episodes were less than memorable. So while I rejoiced that the show had been given a \"new lease on life\" I wondered, \"What will they do next?\"I needn't have worried: Season 9 exceeded all expectations and then some. For the first time since its early years, Smallville was breaking new ground: challenging and dramatic episodes coupled with the first major rewrite of the Superman canon since the 1940's. Smallville was always at its best when it was pushing the envelope, challenging our assumptions about this \"strange visitor from another planet\" and what he really might be capable of, so what better way than to bring an entire Kryptonian city to Earth and force \"Kal-El\" to deal with them on his own terms?From the very beginnings of the Superman character to the classic 1978 Richard Donner film, Krypton had always been portrayed as a doomed paradise, its destruction a Greek tragedy of cosmic proportions. In the season-9 story arc we are shown a very different story: a planet of gifted people at war with themselves, their advanced civilization threatened by overreaching pride and arrogance, teetering on the edge of annihilation. This theme had been hinted at as far back as Season 2 when the Virgil Swann character (Christopher Reeve) was first introduced to help fill in the back-story of Clark's true origins, and served as the basis for several ground-breaking episodes in Seasons 3 thru 5, including the run-up to Pa Kent's untimely death and the revelation that squeaky-clean Clark Kent really did have a dark side, and a rather nasty one at that.The younger Major Zod (Callum Blue) proved the perfect foil for our still-struggling young superhero; their battle in this season's finale is quite possibly the high point of the entire series, a well-earned payoff for the ambitious storyline that kept both tension and anticipation high, each episode building to this stunning climax. At the same time, the series paid homage to the great heroes of comics past by pairing the nascent Justice League (Clark, Chloe, Oliver, Martian Manhunter) with the \"grizzled veterans\" of their recent past, the Justice Society of America. Another Geoff John episode which became a two-hour TV movie, this finely-crafted tribute story challenges our young \"super-friends\" to embrace the true meaning of teamwork, loyalty and sacrifice. In particular, Michael Shanks (Stargate) as \"Hawkman\" proved a very popular and enduring character, appearing in several subsequent episodes, continuing to serve as a mentor for Clark and eventually sacrificing his own life to save Lois Lane (Erica Durance) in Season 10.The overall tone was darker throughout the Season-9 episodes than in previous seasons, and some reviewers have cited this as a drawback. I respectfully disagree. The kids from Smallville High have long since grown up and are facing adult problems, struggling to pull their lives together. For me this grounded all the major characters in a more believable reality that allowed for truly dramatic episodes as opposed to the overwrought melodrama that sometimes over-powered these characters in seasons past. Another high point was the recurring theme that everyone has both good and bad within them, as demonstrated by Zod, Oliver, and particularly John Corbin (\"Metallo\", played by Brian Austin Green) when he confessed his love to Lois Lane. Erica Durance, who will remain the definitive \"Lois\" for many years to come, gave one of her finest performances in that scene, showing great empathy and honesty when she responded simply: \"In a different lifetime, things might have been different.\"The Blu-Ray edition has some quirks that I found annoying, particularly in the episode menu-bar that is far less responsive than it should be. Aside from that, the hi-def quality of the shows is outstanding, as is the cinematography in nearly every episode. If you own no other season of Smallville, this is the one you must have. I guarantee you hours of enjoyment, some truly enjoyable moments and more than a few tears./wwc/",

    "review/summary": "Did I see the same season 9 as the other reviewers?",
    "review/text": "I am confused. I read most of the reviews about season 9 of Smallville, and I just do not understand how anyone can rate the various elements as they did - that is to say, as great, well-acted, great plot lines, and so on. To start with my worst impression, the character of Zod as acted (euphemism, that) by Callum Blue. I found Blue to overact without fail; to have consistently repeated annoying mannerisms, especially facial mannerisms around his mouth and lips, positioning his tongue in the weirdest way I have ever seen in an actor, and very distracting. I also found him repulsive physically, and cannot understand the attraction of Mercer toward him. Alotogether, he spoiled every scene he appeared in. Ugh.Now - as for the plot - or plots. To me, the story line was a most confused, illogical, unbelievable mish mash of stories, somehow engineered to get us through every episode while pretending to be interesting, \"advancing\" the story in an orderly procession. Hm. Many scenes were either repetitious or unbelievable, again, shoved in the strange story line to try to tie it all together. My reaction to every episode has been WTF, and an impatience to get my viewing done with (to justify the expense of buying this season).I suspect that several reviewers forced themselves to like the story and to write a gushing review, instead of telling it like it is: this season is the worst, hideously plotted, badly acted, often not understandable, with story lines jumping back and forth like a jumping bean (that is, following no determined path). Or at other times, telegraphing the ending with so blatant obviousness that all I could react with was yaaaawn, and let's get on with it to the sad, weak end of that episode.One more thing: too often, the plot presented a deus ex machina (I should say, dei ex machina - I lost count) showing up to save the day too too conveniently, and in the nick of time, again, with an intolerable degree of obviousness. Such coincidences simply do not happen, one practically on the heels of the other, even granting this is a science fiction story. One can be asked to suspend disbelief just so often; in season 9, the limit of such indulgences was reached way too soon.There is more, but I grow weary of my own review, as I became weary of the plots having Tess jumping to and fro with no discernible intent, (ditto with Oliver Queen), with her changing allegiances from disc to disc, of Zod's off-putting mannerisms and chewing the scenery, of the odd behaviors of Kal-El (again, with no discernible logical progression), and so on and so forth ad infinitum and ad nauseam. And of the illogicality of presenting us with some 15 or twenty cloned Kandorians who somehow will repopulate a WHOLE PLANET with such scanty numbers (maybe they will use more cloning? Ugh - I could not even stand ONE Zod) (one reviewer decided that oh so luckily there was a huge group of surviving Kandorians.) And sadly, Senator Martha Kent appeared cadaverously thin and looked ill. Again, I wonder - did I somehow get a different season 9 in the mail than the others?Oh, there are a few good bits, here and there, and a weak chuckle, at times. But if season 10 does not improve, and drastically, over season 9, I simply will save my money and do without.",

    "review/text": "When the Eighth Season of Smallville concluded, I wondered how the show could sink any lower. The show's writers had drawn out the Doomsday plot arc all season, then blew it on an anti-climatic finale. Unfortunately, they didn't get back on the right track until very late in Season Nine...literally, the season finale.This season continued the pattern of featuring more obscure Superman comic book characters, including Metallo, The Dark Archer, Roulette, Toyman (a return appearance), and the Justice Society (in the seasons only other passable episode). Though I applaud the show for trying to feature more aspects of the Superman mythology in lieu of the \"freak of the week\" angle, the fact of the matter is that these character just don't resonate as much (and thus don't create as much drama) as the major villains of seasons past. When I think of Superman baddies, the hierarchy is Lex Luthor (done), Zod (don...twice, actually), Brainiac (done), Doomsday (done), and maybe Darkseid (hinted at as the Season Ten primary enemy to Clark). The other guys/gals, at least to me, are just fill-ins.The primary story arc of the season, though, focuses on the return of Zod (this time in body, not spirit, form) and his army of followers. Though the acting of Callum Blue is wonderful in channeling Terrance Stamp's movie Zod interpretation, ultimately his character's angle feels overly drawn-out (including a romance with Tess Mercer that is utterly ridiculous) and doesn't produce any real drama until the very end...once the fate of his character has already been decided.Plus, it wouldn't be Smallville (broadcast on the CW network) without the nauseating love triangles that only serve to create a little hollow drama or sexual tension. Oliver/Lois, Clark/Lois, Clark/Chloe, Oliver/Chloe, Tess/Zod, and Tess/Oliver are all covered this season, and none of them are likeable whatsoever, usually treading over already-covered ground or going in completely ridiculous, outrageous directions.In terms of acting, Tom Welling (Clark) and Allison Mack (Chloe) turn in solid efforts, but Erica Durance (Lois) is still sickening, as is Justin Hartley in portraying Oliver Queen. Blue, as mentioned, is a joy to watch, but his primary foil--Cassidy Freeman as Tess Mercer--pales in comparison (again) to Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor.Thus, despite an incredible finale that came out of nowhere to actually whet my appetite for the 10th (and final) season, this installment in the series was another monumental disappointment. I can only hope that the writers/producers build on \"Salvation\" and deliver a more consistent final effort that will make we WANT to tune in ever Friday night, not doing so like a chore.",

    "review/text": "I have to say, by the end of season 8 I had no faith that the writers of Smallville could do better. They proved me wrong. This is quite litterally the best season of Smallville so far, and it takes a lot of talent to take a show that's been running for almost 10 years and make it fresh and wildly entertaining again. This season stayed focused on its main and sub plot points (there were several of them, and they were spread out very evenly throughout the season) better than any of the other season ever had, and really did not touch much on the obscure, \"what the heck does this have to do with anything\" side stories they tend to throw in. Don't get me wrong, they are fun every now and again, but in the past the writers would go a little overkill on random story after random story, only throwing in nuggets of lore to keep the main plot running, and really only be focused on the first two and last two episodes of the season, and that would get really annoying, really fast.In any case, if you're a Smallville fan that doesn't watch the show regularly (I have too many obligations to dedicate time for watching TV shows), and you buy the season sets like I do to catch up, this one is a definite buy. If you have lost faith in the show years ago thanks to its so-so writing, this is the time to get back into it. The show is wrapping up, and it seems they plan on going out with a bang for the last two seasons of the show.This show will be sorely missed when it is gone, however I am really looking forward to Season 10!",

    "review/summary": "Enter the Justice Society of America in Season 9",
    "review/text": "Season Nine of Smallville continued to expand its universe and mythology with its most ambitious season yet. This season introduced \"Major Zod\" (Callum Blue) as he and the rest of the Kandorian survivors are freed by Tess Mercer, but without their Kryptonian powers. The season also featured appearances by Metallo (Brian Austin Green), the Wonder Twins, The Silver Banshee, Checkmate, The Suicide Squad, Maxwell Lord and Amanda Waller (Pam Grier), and, in a two-part episode, The Justice Society of America!The Zod/Kandorian was the main storyline throughout the year as Zod sought to gain his powers while trying first to ally with Clark, then using duplicity and coercion on Lois and the other Kandorians to convince them that Clark is their enemy. Clark and Lois have seen visions of the future with the world under Zod's control and intend to use the Book of Rao to send Zod and the other Kryptonians off Earth and to their own world.The Checkmate storyline was the most interesting aspect to Season Nine because it largely came out of left field. Checkmate was introduced during the \"Absolute Justice\" episode with Amanda Waller dubbed the White Queen. Icicle, an agent of Checkmate kills the Star Spangled Kid and Wesley Dodds, AKA The Sandman. Clark and Chloe discover old documents in the Daily Planet archives about a group of men: Carter Hall, Kent Nelson, Jay Garrick, Alan Scott, Ted Grant, Abigail Hunkel, Wesley Dodds, and Al Pratt who seemed to have been framed for crimes they didn't commit. The men were released and disappeared but are now being hunted down and killed by Checkmate.Clark eventually finds out that all of the men were members of the Justice Society of America whose real identities were exposed causing them to go into hiding. Clark, Green Arrow, and John Jones team with the remaining JSA members Hawkman, Doctor Fate and Star Girl to track down and stop Icicle.\"Absolute Justice\" was a lot to take in...maybe too much. While it was a wonderful episode and the highest rated of the season, introducing so many new elements, even in a two hour episode was difficult to digest. They should have kept Checkmate a mystery, perhaps just showing the logo at the end, rather than reveal so much at once. Still, it was great to see the JSA, even if it was only a few members. You still got to see their artifacts like Green Lantern's power ring. The Flash's helmet, Wildcat's boxing gloves, and Mr. Terrific's weight belt. There in the JSA's brownstone headquarters was a portrait on the wall of all the members, even HIM...The Spectre. You have to give kudos to the writers for including a glimpse of Ma Hunkel, the original Red Tornado. They did a fantastic job with the details that only true comic fans are going to recognize.Other episode highlights included \"Rabid\" where a Krytonian plague is released that turns people into crazed zombie-like creatures; \"Disciple\" in which Oliver comes under attack by his old mentor; \"Warrior\" features a return appearance by Zatanna; Martha Kent and Perry White return in \"Hostage\" surprising Clark with their relationship but Martha has an even bigger surprise; and finally the season finale \"Salvation\" featuring the climactic battle with Zod.Smallville threw a lot at fans this year as it heads into its tenth and final season. Clark is not in the costume yet but he is moving more in the direction of knowing and understanding what his responsibilities are on Earth. There's still too much of the Lois and Clark romance which often comes off as forced and there's not a great deal of chemistry between the two no matter how hard they try. Season Nine setup what should be a rousing final send off to the show after ten years.",

    "review/text": "First off, I want to let it be known that this review will reflect season 9 and not the discs that the show is formatted on. So with that out of way, let's start shall we?The past nine seasons of Smallville have certainly been a wild ride. Never before has a show managed to stir up so many emotions within myself. For every moment of pure happiness and sadness, there were just as many emotions that dwelled in the realm of utter distaste(read my previous reviews if your so inclined to know what those reasons might be).I had little hope of this show rejuvenating my interest in the ninth season. Over the past eight seasons Clark has managed to defeat the likes of Braniac(twice), Lord Zod, Bizzaro, and Doomsday. Keep in mind that Clark won all these battles while not only living in Smallville, but he still hasn't reached his full potential(in other words, you still can't call the guy Superman). Speaking of Smallville, I find it rather unusual that every character with the exception of Clark has managed to move on. It's even stranger when you consider that not only is he working alongside Lois Lane at the Daily Planet, but he's been seeing Lois as well(yes you read that right, Lois and Clark are DATING!).The season eight finale revealed that Lord Zod would once again be entering the realm of Smallville. After already having a feeling of \"been there done that\" established, and Clark being fully capable of handling all threats in Metropolis from the confines of the farm house, it leaves little hope for any originality in what is essentially now Smallville's twilight years. I've never been more happy to be proven wrong.The Lord Zod that emerges is actually a clone, and while that would certainly seem like a cheesy gimmick, fortunately he's not alone. A decent size of the Kandorian army were cloned as well, including Jor-El, Clark's biological father. I was amused by this, but I still didn't know if this would lead to anything meaningful. Thankfully this choice allowed Clark to grow as an individual and become more independent. Because despite being clones, this meant that Clark was no longer the last remaining Kryptonian. He learned first hand that Kryptonians were indeed a civil race, and that Jor-El wasn't the bad guy he perceived him to be. But every race has it's share of good and bad alike, and despite giving it his all, Clark learns that sometimes you just can't alter destiny. Because in a rather interesting twist, we learn early on that Zod was cloned back when he still had a defining rank of major. This gave the writers a chance to get inside Zod's head and show that despite being a clone, he will ultimately end up making the same choices that will lead him down the same path as the original Zod.Naturally there ends up being a divide amongst the Kandorians as to whom they should be following. Do they follow their commanding officer, or the true last remaining Kryptonian? Zod attempts his best to sway their loyalty by promising that he will find a way to activate their abilities, because for reasons unknown to them, they arrived on earth without the same powers that Clark possesses. And Zod will stop at nothing to see this come to fruition. After all, the only thing powerful men crave is more power.Sprinkled throughout this season were episodes that highlighted special appearances from staple DC characters. The two hour Justice Society episode was particularly special for those familiar with the DC universe. The introduction of Metallo however was strangely unusual. Here you have a character that is infamously known as one of Superman's rivals, yet they portray him as a misunderstood individual with a heart of gold. As quick as the writers were to write off every \"meteor freak\" as nothing more than a villain, I'm surprised at the path they took with Metallo.What I loved best about this season was that it stayed focused on one goal. No longer were there episodes detracting from the plot line that had been driving this season. Never before has Clark been more focused on fulfilling his destiny. Here's hoping the writers can manage wrap up this alternate take on Superman in a way that is not only logical, but meaningful.",

    "review/summary": "The best season yet",
    "review/text": "This season has been the best season yet in the entire series- any missteps they had were nothing compared to past episodes in other seasons. The writers really stepped up their game this season. I think the best change this season was the upped episode count for Erica Durance, who has incredible chemistry with Tom Welling. Together they make the best interpretation of not only the Clark and Lois relationship but the Triangle for two.Zod is a compelling villain who, unlike the less than satisfying Davis Bloom, actually has a lot to do with Clark. The Kryptonian storyline of the season isn't as interesting as the future or Clark/Lois plots, but it does add a nice contrast of light and dark to the season.Another right step was reducing Allison Mack's screen time, who's character has brought down the show for quite a while now and really just doesn't have a place in the series. I'd say her characterization is the only huge misstep this season. Allison has been playing her with a huge ego- thinking she's better than Clark and anyone else, she's written as someone who's just using Oliver for sex, and never apologizes for any of her mistakes which are all much bigger than any of Clark's (someone who does apologize) and yet she's called a 'superhero' and others are pushed to the sidelines to prep her up.Despite some mistakes, this season has definitely been the most entertaining and fascinating. With episodes such as Metallo, Rabid, Kandor, Idol, Absolute Justice, Upgrade and Charade, and highlights like the return of Martha Kent and Perry White, the wonderfully talented guest star Brian Austen Green as Metallo, the Justice society coming to town, Lois and Clark finally getting together, Clark wearing a costume and dealing with his dual identities and Clark meeting Jor-El in person. Wonderful writing, beautiful acting, and interesting plots. This season get's 5 stars from me.",

However, as much as I love this DVD set of Smallville, there is one thing missing -- and has been missing from most of the previous seasons' DVD sets -- interviews with the show's main star, Tom Welling. Hopefully, with the Smallville Season Ten DVD set there will be plenty of features and interviews with Tom to celebrate the show's final season. Smallville Season 9 DVD set is well-worth adding to one's dvd collection.",

    "review/text": "A friend put me on to Smallville just a year or two ago. Since that time, I've been racing 'faster than a speeding bullet' to get caught up. Season Nine is just packed with all kinds of Superhero goodness. Many of my favorite episodes are right in the middle of the season, but its a strong outing for Smallville from start to finish.Old school DC fans who grew up on the Superfriends will no doubt enjoy IDOL where Wonder Twins Zan and Jayna show up in Metropolis. The episode's 21st Century spin, with cell phones and Facebook, pays homage to the characters while updating them nicely. WARRIOR was also a great installment, giving a nod to many fans who head out to the local convention scene. My highlight of the season - and I can't believe I am alone - is ABSOLUTE JUSTICE. Clark, Ollie, and The Manhunter team, up with Hawkman, Stargirl, and some old school heroes to defend Metropolis from a new threat. This two hour movie was great the first time around and really stands up to multiple viewings.Its hard to believe that, as I write this, these characters are in their tenth and final season. We've come along way from Smallville High. The characters have really stretched and grown and there have been many notable additions and guest stars. This season is easily one of my favorites along withSmallville - The Complete Seventh Season, which brought Supergirl full-force into the Smallville universe. Do yourself a favor, and pick it up today.",

I really enjoy seeing how Clark has matured by this point. His confidence with Lois is like a breath of fresh air compared to how he was with Lana. I know...he and Lana had a special relationship, especially in this series. It was full of love, anger, distrust, lots of angst and sorrow...which is great drama. But, I love this confident Clark who \"knew\" that there was something special between he and Lois. Finally owning up to it and growing into is great to see. The way he looks at Lois in the opening scene...is breathtaking. And Lois...contrary to her usual self...is scared which in its own way is refreshing because you know how much this means to her. And when she tells him...you're the one I want to get it right with...gosh that says a lot. I love this series because of the romance just as much as the mystery and action in it. What guy doesn't want to hear, especially when they have the character of Clark, you're the one I want to get it right with. LOL...its a fun series.",

    "review/summary": "The developement of Superman",
    "review/text": "Other reviewers have already noted the key points of the season, so I'll just address a few things. I'll preface my review by saying I've been an avid Smallville fan since about season 3. When season 3 was ongoing is when I got into smallville, and starting with season 4 I have gone to pick up the season the day it comes out. So these comments come from that background.I love this show and always have, even in the dry spells that were not as good and people in general didn't like. I could always see what the creators were shooting for and I enjoyed the stories and took them for what they were...even if they weren't the best. I will admit they were not the best and I will be the first to admit lana needed to go earlier than she did. This season though, I must say, is my favorite season in the entirety of the show. I do also read comics and it's exciting when they bring in other comic book characters. And I love the little hints and things they do that allude to the comics or the future of the characters in the show.And to address clark being kind of dark, this is true...but again it's his developement into Superman. He and the other superheroes are all coming into their own and this is not a biblical-true-to-the-comics view of superman. It's a more modern adaptation, and you have to go into watching the show with that in mind. They generally have kept the same large points intact. But I kind of like the darker clark...he's more serious and in a couple episodes he is leading and learning to inspire others. I think he has to find a balance between his super optimistic view of people and his dark and brooding self where he finds himself at the beginning of season 9...and this is what I love about smallville...it's the developement of the greatest comic book character. And it's an open interpretation and it's fun!So all in all I just wanted to rate it with 5 stars, because I believe this season was amazingly handled and I love it. Of course it's all relative to each person's likes and dislikes but i personally believe this season deserves about a 9.0/10.",

While other show have crashed and burned after a stellar couple seasons (i.e. Lost) Smallville is striving to end out the series with a bang. Following a stellar season 8 with a not so stellar finale, Smallville season 9 brings Clark one step closer to his destiny. Clark gets a new suit, John Corben gets introduced and the Kandor storyline and all its mysteries are laid out for the season. Season 9's strengths lie primarily in Zod's story arc, the development of Clark and Lois' relationship as well as the introduction of several DC characters in the Smallville universe. While other seasons seem to prolong Clark's destiny, season 9 is taking long strides to get there. Season 9 ends in dramatic fashion, like most of the Smallville finales) and sets up the introduction of DC's darkest villain Darkseid. Season 9 incorporates more story arcs compared to previous seasons which had more filler episodes. The end is near, and the show is making one last hurrah. Here's to a spectacular season 10.(BTW, the deleted scenes in this package suck majorly. In the past, some of the deleted scenes made it worth watching again, but this time not soo much)",

    "review/text": "I seen half of season 9, this show is getting darker and a lot better. I remember what the producers want in this show with no flight and no tights. The entire show was about Clark Kent becoming Superman. The way they start show, is puberty of super powers and a boy becoming a man. When you watch this show, it reminds me of a boy becomes a man, like a bar mitzah. All of Clark Kent's powers came one by one, season one, he had the strength, the speed and the x-ray. The second season he had the heat ray, learned he was from Kyrpton, his birth name Kal-El and his father's name Jor-El. The third season, he's discovered super hearing and leaping from tall buildings a single bound and found out his birth mother is Lara and how he got to earth and what happened to his planet. The fourth season and he became an adult. The fifth season, he found the fortress of solitude to start his training and begun college and lose his father in this season and how he has to learn to do things on his own. The sixth season he had developed the super breath and joined a new league called the justice league with future superheroes. The seventh season he also met his cousin from Kyrpton Kara and found out more about Krypton. The eight season started, when Clark Kent started as a rookie journalist in the daily planet and starts becoming not yet a superman as the red-blue blur. The ninth season Clark Kent, started some of his training in the fortress, trying to fly and lead the justice league and also resruct the justice society of america. His mother sent the Superman suit to Clark, that's he was destined to wear and designed from Alec's picture that he drew from the episode Warrior. His last season, ready to fly and wear the tights and start the beginning of becoming the greatest super hero of the world Superman and change the name blur to Superman. This is the last season. For the entire series Clark Kent came from being the nerdy farm boy from Smallville to Mild Manner Reporter for the Greatest News Paper the Daily Planet and the world's greatest superhero Superman. Superman will lead this generation as hawkman once led ours, that's what the entire series was where the man who will become Superman and lead these people into a better world and peace. Just like Hawkman did as Justice Society of America and Superman will lead these superheros as the Justice League.",

    "review/text": "As a Superman fan, Smallville holds a special significance for me. This show began in September of 2001, and Clark was a freshman in high school, and so was I. Each new season represented a new year in the life of Clark, and in season 4, I felt like we graduated together. Season 5 came along with a unique challenge for writing. You see, in the comics, there isn't a whole lot to pull from in Clark's \"college\" years, but one thing was for sure, Clark wasn't in Smallville. The challenge became to find a meaningful and sensible way to keep telling this story. Admittedly, the introduction of Lois seemed an odd choice, but Erica Durance was so compelling in that role, that I'd skip the obvious story questions (namely, if she knows Clark prior to his dimwitted persona to disguise Superman, how would a pair of glasses fool her later?). So Season 5 comes around, and it goes forward. Sure it wasn't it's strongest season, but it kept the same feel, and had enough compelling stories to really make it feel like things had progressed past high school. Then came season 6...Season 6 certainly had some great episodes (Justice immediately springs to mind), but as a whole it tried to take Clark from home and stick him in Metropolis. This is where things really go down hill. Season 7 tried to mature Clark a little bit by throwing his cousin Kara, a.k.a Supergirl, into the mix, but ultimately, the season didn't go anywhere. It didn't do anything. Then season 8 came and really represented a low point for the series. With the departure of the executive producers Al Gough and Miles Miller, as well as Michael Rosenbaum (whose departure was the real impact of the series), the season couldn't find it's legs, even with the promise of Doomsday on the horizon (as well as a pleasant episode written by comic legend Geoff Johns, introducing the Legion of Super Heroes). A lot of us thought this was the final nail in the Smallville coffin, and that season 9 would finally be the departure point for this series. But then, something miraculous happened.Season 9 did something that the show desperately needed for some time. It went for reinvention. Clark, truly accepting his role as a hero (as opposed to superspeeding around Metropolis in his red and blue farm duds), acted as a catalyst for the show to change. It focused less on Clark, the kid from Kansas trying to find his place in the world, and more on Clark, the man in Metropolis stepping up and nearing the end of his journey to becoming Superman. Adding Zod to the mix as the shows main antagonist helped him to take a true stand for a cause. Finally Clark had matured. While the show really isn't \"Smallville\" anymore, and is mostly \"Metropolis\", the reinvention was not only necessary, but successful. Fans of the series found themselves coming back to the series for new and interesting reasons. And with the announcement that season 10 will be the last, we can only hope that Smallville will keep the momentum from last year, and move on towards a satisfying conclusion to a show that has truly been rollercoaster ride for fans of Superman and fans of Smallville alike. And with the announcement that legendary villain of comics, Darkseid being primed to take the stage, this season promises to be just that, a satisfying conclusion.So pick it up on DVD or Blu-Ray. With awesome episodes like \"Absolute Justice\" this season is a must have for any Smallville fan.",

It also limits Clark Kent to Smallville, growing into his Superman identity.... but the producers are not allowed to have Smallville's Tom Welling appear as the red/blue/gold caped and flying Superman that everyone knows and loves.NOT ALLOWED and the writers are trying to keep Smallville going with various plots that dance around different characters, trying to keep Lana in the Smallville Clark's life, with different enemies and issues including the not-the-real Jimmy Olsen being killed.Season Ten is supposedly the last Smallville,,, disappointed in one way as the first seven seasons were fun to watch. IF DC Comics and producers of Smallville were smart.. they would allow Tom Welling continue into the complete flying full blown Superman character that everyone expects. Could be done as a major movie... or done as a two show introduction ,, really well done ... with Tom Welling dressed and acting like Superman character, with several shows using Justice League characters, Superman with Lois , etc. etc.Movie Superman Returns didn't go anywhere. Smallville and Tom Welling, with good writing and stories could carry Superman for the next decade...Bet season ten doesn't have Welling in red/blue Superman outfit and flying. Any takers??Season 9 is not as good as 8, which wasn't as good as 7 which was the end of the Smallville's good stories.. hate to say it because I'm a fan and enjoy watching the show. Personally may wait till it gets cheap in Blu Ray to buy, having watched once, it's not something to invested premium dollars to buy ..",

Rather than come up with creative ways to move the story along they rely on characters acting like idiots who have no idea what they should be doing. Or worse yet, doing the opposite of what they would normally do just so they can get to the next scene. Ahhh...who cares about continuity! Who cares about logic! Who cares about whether these episodes make any sense! Not the amatuers who write this show. Tom Welling, you should be ashamed of this 9th season. What exactly are you executive producing anyway! Do you even watch these episodes? Chloe and Tess are trapped inside of Watchtower when it goes into lockdown and NOBODY is notified that there is a problem at Watchtower?!?! Where's Clark? Where's Oliver? Clark can save a kitten in a tree 10 states away but hasn't a clue when his home base goes into lockdown due to a security breach?

    "review/summary": "Probably the best season of SMALLVILLE!",
    "review/text": "SMALLVILLE perhaps peaked with SEASON 9! I think it's the only season where there are no weak main characters and also the running storyline/plot (Zod and the Kandorian army) of Season 9 was handled in a spot on manner, with real fluidity, humanity, and power. I badly wanted Season 8 to be the best season since it felt more like a \"Superman\" show, but the show's creative staff made some huge blunders (the Lana arc, killing off an iconic character, and the disappointing DOOMSDAY season finale) that turned what should have been a magnificent, all-time season into a rather what-could-have-been one.The Season 9 premiere SAVIOR starts off about two weeks after the events of the S8 finale DOOMSDAY, with a brooding Clark Kent (stalwart Tom Welling) still mourning the death of \"Jimmy\", the disappearance of Lois (the Legion ring sent her into the future) and blaming himself for what transpired with Davis Bloome. Clark has resolved to cut all ties to humanity and train at the fortress and fight injustice from the shadows. No longer the Red-Blue Blur, now he is just The Blur, draped in dark outfits with the House of El symbol (cap S) on his chest. Chloe (charming Allison Mack) tries to convince Clark to no avail that he is more than just an alien and that his Earth ties are important to who he is. In the exciting opening sequence to SAVIOR, Lois (gorgeous Erica Durance) returns from the future, landing on the Metropolis Monorail, and is followed by a mysterious ninja-draped warrior woman named Alia; they fight on the train and the time rift opening causing the rail to go off the tracks and Clark saves everyone and sees Lois through the window; her return gives him a renewed sense of hope and purpose. As the ep unfolds, we find out that Alia has returned from the future to try to kill Clark (they have an exciting hand-to-hand combat fight in his barn while both powerless due to blue Kryptonite); meanwhile Major Zod (brilliant cast addition Callum Blue) and his Kandorian army (inadvertently brought to Earth by Tess using the Rao symbol in DOOMSDAY) have infiltrated the Luthor mansion and Zod compels Tess (returning regular Cassidy Freeman) to side with him in helping them to re-gain their powers on Earth. This superb premiere sets up a great season!Early Season 9 contains some of the best eps, with Eps 2-METALLO (with a surprising strong guest turn by Brian Austin Green as the title character) and 3-RABID (a zombie-themed ep) surpassing SAVIOR in greatness. RABID in particular has a magnificent Clark/Lois scene in the rain near the ep's end that is beautiful to watch! I know the show is taking their budding romance slowly, but these two incredible looking people ought to be all over each other! Even the immediately weaker eps 4-ECHO and 5-ROULETTE have great Clark/Lois interactions; Welling and Durance have undeniably fantastic chemistry! The next great ep is 6-CROSSFIRE, a more iconic Clark and Lois dating-themed episode with Clark trying to help Lois get a gig as a morning TV show host; the end of the ep has a great series turning point that many fans have been waiting YEARS to happen! Early season 9 continued on a strong path with ep 7-KANDOR, flashbacking to Zod and his army before they cloned themselves prior to the destruction of Krypton; we get to see Zod and Jor-El (played in a heartfelt performance by guest star Julian Sands). Ep 8-IDOL is another iconic Lois-Clark ep with Lois torn between Clark and The Blur and ends with I think one of the top Clark-Lois moments in the entire series. The great, tragic Ep 9-PANDORA finally explains what happened to Lois when she went to the future between DOOMSDAY and SAVIOR. Ep 10-DISCIPLE gives the viewer the first taste of Clark and Lois as an actual couple! The weakest part of S9 for me is the 2-hour ABSOLUTE JUSTICE (which will end up being 2 separate 1-hour eps 11 and 12 on the S9 DVD). I just felt it had little important to do with the rest of S10 (kind of what that Lana arc did to S8!) and it was kind of all over the place.Later Season 9 kicks into high gear focusing on Zod and his plans for world domination and Clark trying to bring out the good in Zod (as his clone father Jor-El compelled him to do in KANDOR) and bond with his Kandorian \"family\". Standout eps include 15-CONSPIRACY, where Clark and Lois separately deal with a mad doctor bent on taking down suspected aliens (Clark works with Zod's lieutenant Faora to save her sister Vala), 17-CHECKMATE, where Chloe (as Watchtower) is kidnapped by Amanda Waller (solidly played by Pam Grier), the head of government organization Checkmate to reveal the identities of the Justice League members, 19-CHARADE, a heartbreaking episode where Lois is truly torn between Clark and The Blur, 21-HOSTAGE, the return of Martha Kent (a welcome brief return by the radiant Annette O'Toole), and the landmark season finale 22-SALVATION, perhaps the best finale of the entire series!The overall tone of Season 9 is darker and more mature than all previous seasons and may not sit well with more traditional SMALLVILLE fans that prefer the early years \"freak-of-the-week\" format and lighter tone. There isn't much lightness to Season 9 as it is definitely more hardcore in it's presentation. The writing and acting of Season 9 is hands down the best the show has ever had and the show benefits from having a smaller main cast than in previous years, so that each character gets just enough screen time for the season. Callum Blue as Major Zod (next to Lex Luthor) is probably the best villain SMALLVILLE has ever had, and because he got the one season (whereas Lex began to wear thin in his later seasons) to showcase his talents, he'll probably pound-for-pound be considered the best villain. The Clark-Lois chemistry (as played superbly by Welling and Durance) is always welcome and is always there even in the weaker eps. I like that they are presented as an all-too-human couple that are both unsure of their intertwined destinies; they almost act afraid of how powerful their feelings are for each other at times; there is a maturity about their relationship that is refreshing to follow. With any season, there will be a few missteps, like the Ollie-Chloe pairing and ABSOLUTE JUSTICE as mentioned earlier, but all in all, Season 9 is probably the best, most consistent season of SMALLVILLE!SEASON 9 regulars: Tom Welling, Allison Mack, Erica Durance, Cassidy Freeman, Callum Blue, Justin Hartley",

Green Arrow and Chloe coming together was interesting. Clark and Lois together finally. The return of Clark's mom still protecting her son and all the past superheroes coming together to join forces was the highlight of season 9 This DVD is a must have for Smallville fans everywhere.

    "review/text": "Like previous Seasons, it's difficult to watch just one episode at a time. This Season is a bit more convoluted than most, and the characters have taken on a darker persona, certainly a diversion of the expected Superman evolution. Some of the plots seem a bit contrived and forced. My only real objection to the writing is the droning on with the apologies that Clark continuously makes. Okay, we get it, he's learning, he's taking risks, and some of his actions turn out bad. Wake up call, it's called being human... and because he's Not, get over it. It's a fine line between character endearment and nausea. Overall, the Season is action packed and entertaining, and as expected, all the characters are easy on the eyes. So with that said, and as expected, I'm hooked on the show and am patiently waiting for Season 10.",

I especially liked being able to see more of what made Zod who he became, and the very close and friendly relationship between him and Jor-El. In many ways it reminded me of the Clark/Lex relationship in the early seasons of the series. I am still amazed at what the production team is able to do with effects on a television timeline and budget, and the ninth season required them to stretch their imaginations and skills.Bottom line is that I'm a huge Smallville fan, and this season did not disappoint.",

    "review/text": "Season 9 is an excellent season. However, I wouldn't give it the rave reviews that I have seen from some others. It's about as good as all the other seasons were. Honestly, while I know that they had to follow Superman lore in pairing Lois Lane and Superhottie, I really HATE IT! I think Lana Lang looked much better dangling from his arm---and I do mean dangllllliiiiinnnngggg. That is something that I believe is finally being corrected in this mini Super saga. The writers and directors aren't playing relationship cat and mouse between Lois and Clark quite as much as they did with Lana and Clark. I was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO sick of it. Let the boy catch the girl and keep her for awhile sheesh. What I don't like about season 9 (and season 8) is the way they drewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww outtttttttttttttttttt in slooooooooooooooow mooooootion, the Oliver Queen brooding bad boy, \"I hate myself so much for killing Lex\" story line. Enough with the whining Ollie--you killed Lex, get OVER IT ALREADY!!! Penance doesn't suit you! Leave that to SuperHottie. Apart from the season story line itself, I am very very unhappy with the disc protection or rather lack thereof in this set. They've changed it in the last two seasons and it really stinks. It falls apart much too easily. I would have thought it was just the fault of the first seller I purchased from, but when I received the season 9 discs, the inner system was falling apart there too. The reason I buy boxed sets is because I want to keep them like . . . FOREVER! So getting a season with a faulty inner holder just isn't cool, and most certainly not when ive had to pay close to 50 bux a season in some cases.",

    "review/text": "After being a fan of the series from season one to the ninth and also seeing the development of Clark Kent into the Universal Hero that he will become is entertaining as well as enjoyable to watch but where the series is now with its storyline and characters why bother calling this Smallville at all since they don't even really live there anymore except it seems on the Kent farm. I truly enjoy seeing the other DC hero cameos that are played on the series which make this very enjoyable as well from Green Arrow to The Martian Manhunter, also for myself that made this season enjoyable was the lack of the whinny Lana Lane who with this show I couldn't really give a damn for. Don't get me wrong Lana Lane in the comic series was o.k. but this version from the beginning made her seem very shallow for most of the seven seasons she was on, they made her seem to have more depth but when you saw her playing with the feelings of Clark and Lex Luthor in a few seasons she just seemed to try and wait to see who could take care of her better not really seeming to care about other peoples feelings at all. The series also is a nice intro of the more romantic development between Lois Lane and Clark that we saw coming out in season five, and of course the situations Clark finds he has to deal with throughout the season. A little sadly the tenth season that's coming out is going to be the last as told by the producers which makes since as you don't want to run a show to long where it becomes repetitive and looses entertainment for the fans. So for Superman fans out there here's the newest season set to add to the collection....",

This season showed much improvement, but it was not like the old seasons of smallville. Seasons 1-4 and 6 were Smallville's greatest and had the best plotlines.I did enjoy seeing Clark open back up and express his feelings for someone and I am glad it was Lois. But what the heck is up with the costume?? Since Smallville was renewed for a 10th season, I hope the episodes will be entertaining and focus more on Superman rather than Clark Kent. Lets see those primary colors we all know and love and let smallville go out with a BANG rather than a BLAH!",

    "review/text": "I really like smallville wathc it from the start was first on my list of shows to watch but then feel to second behind supernatual. liked them both evenly until the second season of supernaural. I think it was the long breaks inbetween season and I was force to watch reruns id rather watch reruns of supernatural than smallville. got burt out on smallville reruns could wathc about two to three shows a day on differnt channels except on sunday. the changes I would make would be a little less of the I an women hear me roare type of kiss ass women on the show and a little more comic book. I dont want to sound like a male shovanist but I agree with the one view the women in the show are over the top. they all seem to be bruce lee, shena worrer, from hell type and the only men to beat them usally have powers of some sort. even cloe who got a little dark in the last few season kicks some ass. let c tess mercer as the new lex that sucks she's no lex luther dont know how they came up with a women villian to take lex's spot. I guess she coulnt fill the shoes of lex unless she was a judo master. then their lois who went from simple reporter woman to an army brate. tought by special forces, green berret, navy seals so she has to kick a lot of ass. but still gets knocked out a lot when clark has to show his stuff. thier's just too many I guess modern tv women on the show that seems to kick the ass of the low to middeum guards and other men on the show. and its the end of the last season and clark still cant fly. I mean they did one episode at the begging where they tried to explain why he cant. but ever person from crypton get to earth and they are like birds they start flying right away. I wish it was like the superman movie where zod and his peopl come to earth but dont know about there powers yet or what they can do. but clark seems to be the only one from crypton whose in the dark about his abilites. hell even mrs kent got some kick ass she went from small town wife to a gun packing secret agent. I dont know whats in the shows futher for season 10 since tess has wimped out and she not the super bitch she was shes more like a wimpy bitch now. maybe its because zod may be the new villian with his powers and all and tess my be leaving the show. cloe and clark are the two original still left on the show and I hope she stays around. I just want to c some real women on the show not the 2010 women that networks are putting all over the place. man kicking abilities and a bitchy attitude every now and then just beacuse they can. and its time for clark to fly. I miss the cryptonight humans that clark use to fight havent seen any of them in a while. that whole army of super humans that lex use to collet when no where I mean they had a few of them show up in season 8 but thats it . wheres the rest of them. but anyway I'll continue to watch the show and be a fan of it. maybe since this is suppose to be the last season of supernatural smallville will return to the top of my list of show to watch every week.",

    "review/text": "The character of Superman has always been one of great moral ethics, courage, and inspiration. Not inspiration to just comic book readers, but to real-life athletes, the character's fellow comic book heroes, and to the average day-to-day person living his or her life. The tv show Smallville has done a pretty good job showing the viewers how one teenager with extraordinary abilities can change and inspire a world. at least, up to season 7.The show has always had a knack for unrealistic and often ridiculous moments (Smallville, a supposed \"small town\", only being practically 30 minutes from Metropolis, one of the biggest cities in the DC Universe? Clark not going to college yet SOMEHOW getting a job at a internationally-successful newspaper? The \"death\" of Lex Luthor in Season 8? The extended and awful Clark-Lana relationship?). But season 9 has definitely topped off the list of stupidity on Smallville. The writers must have confused the optimistic, inspirational, and heroic Superman with the depressing world and character of Batman. Clark wearing the same red jacket and blue t-shirt did get old, yes, but to change the core nature of the character Superman into some selfish, moody, and whiny jerk? Someone should admit him to Arkham Asylum... The show has honestly not been the same since Clark left high school.Also, the thing that is so comical about these last few seasons is the fact that Superman is supposed to be the hero that inspired all of the other heroes. In the world of Smallville, by the time Clark Kent dons the classic costume, every other hero is bound to already be saving the world, leaving Clark or \"Superman\" to whine about a kryptonite-powered Lana (thank you, season 8!). No, but the real review is about Season 9 alone. While Season 8 is worth at least 2 stars for the decent character of Davis Bloome, Season 9 has absolutely no redeeming value. Callum Blue's Zod does not come off as evil, or even as a nice addition to the cast. He can't even hold a candle to Michael Rosenbaum's \"Lex\" or John Glover's \"Lionel\". Zod was already done in seasons 5 and 6! Also, (SPOILER ALERT) Lois finding out Clark's secret BEFORE he even becomes Superman? That is pushing it so much that it's beyond over-the-top.The best part of season 9 was the episode \"Absolute Justice\". There, the viewers at least saw a glimpse of maybe an inspiring hero that Clark could become. It seems ever since Clark left high school, he has been focusing more on saving Kryptonians (guess we can say goodbye to \"Last Son of Krypton\") than his friends and family on Earth. Overall, a rating over 1 star would be too generous for Smallville: Season 9. Here's hoping that season 10 will bring about the hero we all know and love.",

Save yourself the time and money and DO NOT subject yourself to this haphazard mash of laziness and television network under-funding. Hopefully Season 10 will give Smallville the send-off the show deserves, mark a return to LOCATION SHOOTS (as should be the NORM), and help us all forget that the inexcusably poor Season 9 ever existed. I have been a huge Smallville fan over the past decade, and am accordingly a big supporter of the show, but I can NOT in good conscience endorse the cringeworthy piece of GARBAGE that is Season 9!!

Yeah, he's still the Clark Kent we all know and love, he's just more mature now. Yeah, we all have our opinions, but if you dislike S9, you dislike Clark Kent/Superman. I say that because Clark never whined like he did in all the other seasons of SV. He never hesitated about saving the world, he was never ashamed of himself or his powers, he never sat on his ass while everyone and their dog did something with their lives. Look, I love SV to death, and I can understand his behavior in the early years, but after HS that behavior should have ended. Let the character grow. It was getting ridiculous when he continued that same behavior in seasons 5, 6 and 7. Hell, every trace of S7 should be burned! Okay, there are some good episodes : )S10 isn't finished yet.

As Clark kept an eye on Lois, he realized that she was being followed by a Kryptonian assassin from the future but, when he confronted the assassin, he discovered that she was actually after him and explained that she came to defeat him before he \"destroyed their world.\" As the two battled under the radiation of blue kryptonite, Clark managed to win the fight and Alia fell on her own sword. then you see zod come with more Kryptonians trying to gain there powers. then you see clark team up the the JSA zod and the other Kryptonian gain there powers and try to take over the world. there are meny more great things so see in this season so if you haven't seen it yet get it. it's a must buy.",

Clark has now adopted the person of The Blur. He essentially does the same thing he does later as Superman, but he does so in a different costume under the cover of darkness. Much like the more modern comics, the story line focus on him balancing his duties as The Blur, his life as Clark on the farm and at the Daily Planet, and his Kryptonian heritage. There's a two hour \"movie\" episode that introduces quite a few DC heroes to the series alongside series regulars like the Green Arrow and Martian Manhunter. There's also a twist at the end you won't see coming. Be sure to watch the first eight seasons before or you'll be lost. Overall, a great story.",

    "review/text": "I used to comment on another series, Bones, regarding how they were able to make you laugh one minute and cry the next...how it was rare to make you feel a multitude of emotions in one episode. Smallville does this a lot...and this is one episode representative of that. It just shows me how good the writers are...how they can have such an imagination to include light hearted moments with dark moments in 43 minutes. I simply like good storytelling and Smallville has it. People may judge and say...oh...it's silly or overly dramatic...but you need to sit back and just take it all in and enjoy the wide range of emotions they bring out of you. Don't be critical of it...don't dissect it...just enjoy it for what it is a story that is dramatic, romantic, funny and silly and just plain fun. Lois provided the light hearted moment as she was hypnotized by Clark accidentally into becoming a 1950's domesticated woman who's only purpose was to take care of her man. Erica Durance pulled this off pretty darn well and Clark/Tom Welling struggle with the craziness of it all. Meanwhile...Zod is never far from providing \"danger\" and darkness to this drama. Clark having to navigate between Lois and Zod in one episode was a pretty difficult thing to do...but he did. And it culminated in Clark taking matters into his own hands...destroying Zod's tower. That final scene with Clark destroying the tower with fire flowing out of his eyes...is one of my favorite scenes in the series. He is rarely pre-emptive in handling danger but this time...he did it. Whether it was the right thing to do..i.e. destroying property...is probably debatable in his eyes...but he did it nonetheless. To some..it was the only solution to Zod. I loved the special effects...I love the music in the background...I just loved how powerful Clark Kent seemed in that final scene...it was exciting. Truthfully...I don't know how you can't enjoy this series...you have to be hyper critical to not enjoy it...because it is simply good storytelling...some of the best in TV land. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS SHOW.",

I am the proud owner of nine seasons, and will eventually purchase the final season.There are so many other characters that will be missed, such as Lionel and Lex Luther, Bizzaro, the Green Arrow, Chloe, and many others. Why this show to my knowledge, didn't get the recognition it deserved is puzzling to me. Well anyway, I will always be a fan. Humm...., I wonder what Tom Welling will be doing next?",

    "review/summary": "Season 9- Kneel Before Zod!",
    "review/text": "This has to be best season in Smallville's history. The main protagonists in Season 9 are Major Zod and his army of Kandorians We finally see Zod, even though its a younger version of him (Major Zod, a clone, who's DNA was taken years before he became the evil conquerer General Zod, who destroyed Krypton). He's basically a replacement for the Smallville version Lex Luthor, who like 'Major', we see before he became the archnemesis of Superman. Last time we saw Zod was the season finale for Season 5 and premiere for Season 6, in that he possessed Lex Luthor and was easily defeated by Clark in a 3 minute fight where at the end he was banished to the Phantom Zone. (This was very disappointing to fans, as Zod is this great villian and was easily disposed of, and in the form of Lex. Don't get me started on how easily Darkseid was defeated in Season 10! Darkseid is a demigod, and he was defeated so...nevermind)Clark finally wears a REAL COSTUME (not the red jacket/blue t-shirt deal. And I like the black costume over the red leather jacket costume in Season 10! He looks like Flash Gordon with an S on his chest! ) The Blur's black costume is reminiscent of Superman's black Kryptonian costume from the comics (and perhaps from the Tim Burton version when he was picked to direct 'Superman Lives', the cancelled movie where Superman wore an all black costume) and we finally see him wearing his family crest (the 'S') on his chest. The whole back and forth with Clark and Zod was very similar with Clark's relationship with Lex, as they befriended each other at first (although Clark is never truly trusting of Zod, knowing what his older self turned into)Clark and Lois' romantic relationship develops, we are introduced to Metallo, we see more of Green Arrow and meet his new sidekick Mia (known as Speedy in the comics), we see Jor-EL in the flesh and Krypton in the episode 'Kandor', (which shows the friendship Jor-EL and Zod had, similar to Clark and Lex)and we meet the Justice Society of America (Featuring a super hero cast of Hawkman, Dr.Fate, Stargirl, Star-Spangled Kid, Sandman, and villian Icicle). And finally, behind the scenes we see Checkmate, the secret government organization bent on taking down superhumans, believing they are a major threat to mankind.Overall, a huge improvement on the disappointment of Season 8 (the Doomsday storyline, very poor writing, many holes in the plot, terrible climax! And why get rid of Jimmy?) and in my opinion better than any other season, including Season 10.Just one complaint I have about ALL of Smallville's episodes: The human characters have had to have MULTIPLE CONCUSSIONS as they have been thrown across rooms so many times and have been knocked unconscious! And they have been in Smallville and Metropolis Hospitals MULTIPLE times, with HUNDREDS of injuries! Where are the scars? Human characters like Chloe, Lana, Lois, Lex, Oliver, Tess, Jimmy, Martha, etc.. have ALL had injuries to their body and face, yet they have no scars!? Hmmm....",

This is the longest running Superman television series (Sorry, \"Lois & Clark\") and continues into its ninth season which is an amazing achievement. The series developed by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar based on the DC Comics characters will be beginning its tenth and final season this fall focusing on the man becoming Superman.Starring Tom Welling as Clark Kent, his character finally makes his first attempts to embrace his hero birthright and calling. It turns out in season 9 that Planet Earth is such a fabulous place that other Kryptonians want to move into the neighborhood and call it home. Of course, they don't want to share, but take control. Clark sends a warning to Zod and his followers, particularly if they try to ensnare Lois Lane played by Erica Durance in their pursuits.More characters from the DC Universe show up to add a little something extra like the shape-shifting Wonder Twins, the magical Zatanna, and in the double episode, the Justice Society of America's Doctor Fate, Hawkman, and Stargirl.Bonus Features:There are two featurettes, one is \"Kneel Before Zod\" which is an in-depth look at this Kryptonian criminal and his beginnings in the DC Silver Age, and his appearances in film, animation, and live-action television. The other featurette is \"Justice For All\" where the \"Smallville\" creative team as they discuss bringing the Justice Society of America team of superheroes to television for the first time.There are two episodes with cast and creator commentaries on \"Idol\" and \"Kandor.\" Also there are some unaired scenes.",

    "review/text": "Having cruised through the DVDs already, the ninth season is a good one. The overall season arc of the Kandorians under Major Zod is not as strong as some prior seasons' storylines, but this season's true gems are the budding romance between Clark and Lois and the high quality of the individual episodes. The quest to stop the future that Lois is returning keeps popping up as well, along with character arcs for Oliver Queen and his Green Arrow persona and a seeming disregard for civil liberties by Chloe Sullivan.In particular, we start getting more of the characters from the DC Universe making their appearances. We get a classic Superman villain in Metallo, though they might have chosen a better actor to play this kryptonite-hearted baddie. Still, the character design was nice, typically with a Smallville flavor instead of being a direct translation of the comic version. The Justice Society, at least in part, makes an appearance that stops the presses at the midpoint of the season. We also get the Martian Manhunter, who is far too underused for an actor of Phil Morris' caliber, doing his cavalry impersonation, which is nice. Even the Wonder Twins, much improved over their old Superfriends cartoon incarnation, though still bumbling in their hero worship, play a part in this season.The special features are nowhere near as good as in prior seasons. There are deleted scenes from 8 of the 21 episodes, but most of these are just a few seconds. The commentaries are OK, but again, without the liveliness of the early sets, and far less entertaining. Still, the discs are good transfers of the episodes, which is the primary purpose. While some blooper reels would be nice, or perhaps some more cut scenes and more actors on the commentaries, there's not much one could do to improve this set. (It's so nice to have a \"Play\" option and not have to go to each episode's individual menu to play them, which too many shows still do on their DVDs.)",

    "review/text": "The World needs protection and Clark Kent is the right hero for the job in \"Smallville: The Complete Ninth Season\". In order to focus on his training and protect the citizens of Metropolis, Clark Kent (Tom Welling) has distanced himself from those he cares most, but all things change when Lois Lane (Erica Durance) returns from the future with no memories of where she's been for the past weeks. Her return is not the only big surprise for Clark as the villainous Zod (Callum Blue) and a legion of loyal followers have been released from a mysterious black orb and attempt to gain their true kryptonian powers. Despite Clark's best efforts to help the visitors and prevent the destruction of Earth, Zod's true nature comes clear and lures Lois into his schemes. Clark will also cross paths with the enchanting Zatanna, the troublesome Wonder Twins and the legendary Justice Society of America. \"Smallville\" is the popular live-action comic book series that follows the adventures of a young Clark Kent during the years before he becomes Superman. With its engaging season-long story arc and the introduction of many DC Comic characters, the ninth season is certainly one of the most amusing of the entire series.\"Smallville: The Complete Ninth Season\" is certainly a well recommended purchase for any fan of the series. All 21 episodes are presented in a 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is certainly a noticeable improvement over the Blu-ray releases of the sixth, seventh and eighth seasons. Unfortunately, its 5.1 Dolby Digital audio track isn't as spectacular, but still offers a pleasant audio experience. Among its two-and-a-half hours of special features, it includes audio commentary track with show's cast and crew on two episodes (Kandor & Idol), two indepth comic book featurettes (Kneel Before Zod & Absolute Justice: From Script to Screen) and nine minutes of deleted scenes. Overall, \" Smallville: The Complete Ninth Season \" scores a \"B\".",

It was also satisfying to finally see Clark & Lois really together as they are meant to be. I'm not a fan of Jor-El or the actor playing him and can't wait for this storyline to play itself out, but in this episode it all works. If you watch no other episode this season, this is one not to miss. This whole season is so much better than last that you should watch them all anyway.

    "review/text": "Each new episode of S9 constantly amazes me at how awful this season is. It seems that following the show for 8 seasons and any dvd sets before s9 are now worthless to the overall story for those previous seasons don't seem to matter to the show creators any more. They are simply creating a new show in S9 with no concern for the story they have been telling these past 8 seasons. Personally, I blame the focus on Lois this season for dismal ratings and utterly horrible storytelling - and I'm not the only one who thinks this if the ratings are anything to go by. Come on, being on Friday can excuse some of a drop, but wealth of viewers that departed this show this season compared to last is mindboggling. Season 9 pretty much killed any notion that Smallville can come close to what it was like barely a season ago in s8.Worst of all, is Smallville's idea that Superman is a thug who has no qualms about being violent to women. Holding Tess over the edge of a building? Gleefully destroying the Two Towers with no thought for the humans scurrying out of the way on the street below? Arson? That is not the Clark of Smallville season 1-8 and I prefer that Clark to the black suited violent thug he is currently. I can't imagine how DC signed off on this version of Clark and I for one have no desire to see anything related to Superman, movies or otherwise, because of Smallville season 9. If the \"mythos\" has decided the new Superman for a new generation of viewers is a violent thug who likes lording his powers over the humans he is supposed to protect, that I can do without. Coupled with the ignorant, fame-seeking and feminsim-regressing \"Lois Lane\" Smallville is THE WORST addition to 70 years of mythos.",

    "review/text": "You know your childhood has been ruined when you can't stand the sight of Clark Kent, the alter ego of your once hero. Limping into its 9th season, Smallville stars Tom Welling, Allison Mack, Erica Durance, and Justin Hartley.The season starts with Clark Kent (Tom Welling) acting like a Grade A jerk to everyone in his life that ever meant anything to him. He is training with his psychotic father to fulfill his destiny, finally, right? No. We still don't get our Superman, not even close, he still can't fly and he wears Batman black as his \"Blur\" costume.Clark Kent is figuratively dead leaving Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Oliver (Justin Hartley) on their own. Chloe is left to look for her lost cousin (Erica Durance) and mourn her dead husband alone.Later, we see that Lois is back with a hitchhiker that confuses me more than intrigues me. As Alia dies, she gives Clark his father's watch. Interesting right? Not really, later in the season we find that this plot goes nowhere.All this drama caused by Jimmy OIsen's death. Yes, I'll say it again, Jimmy Olsen. Not even the real Jimmy Olsen to boot, but an imposter, Henry James Olsen.The first episode is the beginning of a mess of a season. Just wait till you get to the part of the season where Clark inexplicably loves Lois. Or the part where he lost his humanity when he couldn't find her (Pandora). Also, he doesn't trust Chloe, the girl that stuck by him till the end. Retcons galore!The Clark/Lois romance stinks of network interference. Only in bizarre world could this Clark Kent and this less than inferior Lois end up together. Clark is an immature totalitarian thug and Lois continues to be a buffoon.Chloe Sullivan is pushed back to the sidelines. Boobs over brains rules in CW land, I guess. The more Lois is shoved down your throat, the less Chloe you'll see. You may block the sun with a finger, but its always there. I look forward to seeing Allison shine once again sometime soon.Don't get me started on villains. Zod (Callum Blue) is a joke compared to Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) or even last years Davis Bloom/Doomsday (Sam Witwer). As the season progresses you do get some good moments with Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freedman) and Amanda Waller (Pam Grier).All and all a terrible show. Nothing like seasons 1 through 5 where you could see a hero emerging. Smallville, thank you for killing my Superman.",

    "review/text": "smallville hasnt been good since season 5.im sick of seeing other people mainly women with the same superpowers as superman.in todays society you just cant have any man getting all the glory without women taking the spotlight and having the same powers.just watch the very first episode of season 9 and already you see a women with the same powers as superman even having heat ray vision.clark and lois relationship is nice but its better to have a love triangle like smallville had in season 1 with lana clark and chloe of course that didnt last long.after season 5 the show started getting ridiculous with so many people getting super powers.and exactly how many times are they gonna keep using the same excuse for women to have the same powers as superman i come from the same world as you kal-el how many people have survived this doomed planet and havent shown up till now.the writers are either burned out or just cant think up anything.proof of this is the zombie episode in this season.the guy who plays zod is about as menacing as a puppy dog.i guess they brought in this british actor to appeal to uk viewers but he is absolutely the wrong kind of guy to be playing zod.also it seems unless a man has super powers he cant stand a chance of beating a woman up in a fight on this show.because they show two normal people fighting and the woman wins the fight and exactly where in real life can this happen?unless the guy is like super old and out of shape.thats how ridiculous this show has become now.",

    "review/text": "It is sad that this series destroyed the story of Superman.Superman did not come to earth to \"learn\" how to use his super powers. Let me explain: We were born on earth and our bodies have adjusted to the gravity. In fact generation after generation of humans have evolved or adapted to all of the earth's elements. Now imagine you travel to another planet and their atmosphere and gravity are lighter, having been used to heavier gravity you would now be able to fly. And bullets that would destroy and kill the people of that planet would just bounce off you. That is why Kryptonite does not kill Superman, it would be equal to someone from that other planet giving you a rock or piece of earth, it would make you \"normal\" or weak.Of course none of this is reality, it is just science fiction fun, but it is the truth behind Superman's powers, not this Smallville nonsense!Let's get the facts straight. Quit ruining the story for future generations!",

    "review/text": "There are some folks who dislike season 9, but that just because they still want to see Clark as that farm boy from Smallville. Yet, they don't realized that Clark is no longer the farm boy that we all love, but a news reporter who is embracing his destiny as the future superman. Yes, I still miss the Kent farm, The Talon, the Torch and even Smallville High School, but we must move on. In season 9, Clark is one step closer in being Superman, but he must first deal with his own personal issues, including his new love for Lois. I love seeing new heroes on the show, including Stargirl and Hawkman. Won't spoil more, but season 9 is far the best.",

The biggest flaw of the season was supposed to be its highlight, and that's the ABSOLUTE JUSTICE event. This was supposed to be a massive game-changer, written by comic book author extraordinare Geoff Johns (who's been writing Superman and Green Lantern for a long time now), and it just totally missed the mark. A lame villain responsible for the deaths of some of the greatest heroes in history? Nuh-uh. This was the chance to go battle royale and really kick an inordinate amount of butt by throwing in some c-list villains. But no... they shot wide and it ended up being a total letdown.However, the rest of the season has got me revved up in a big way.Coolness.",

    "review/summary": "The Season I Fell in Love With Tom Welling and Fell in Love All Over Again With Superman and Lois Lane",
    "review/text": "At the end of Smallville's 8th season, I believed that the chemistry between Tom Welling (Clark Kent) and Erica Durance (Lois Lane) had been fired up full blast... I WAS WRONG. It did sizzle at the conclusion of Season 8 and for the first five episodes of this 9th Season. But, to my amazement, the sizzle turned into a wild fire by the end of the sixth episode, appropriately titled: Crossfire.I am a classic movie lover. In my humble opinion, most films made after 1965 are unworthy of my time and money. However, every once in a very rare while, a modern film or TV series comes along that totally captures my heart. Smallville Season 9 is one of those precious rarities. The Welling/Durance onscreen romance is something reminiscent of the films of yesteryear. Because the old studios had so much talent under long term contract, they could try out different pairings and see what struck gold: Fred and Ginger, Bogie and Bacall, Clark Gable's Rhett Butler to Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara and my personal favorite, Cary Grant and Rita Hayworth in \"Only Angels Have Wings.\" It's a darn shame those two greats never made another film together. But the few scenes they did share in that film stole the spotlight from the film's actual leading lady, Jean Arthur. It catapulted Rita Hayworth to stardom until she reached iconic status in \"Gilda\" and it cemented the legendary Cary Grant sexy bravado that would serve him well for the rest of his career. Well, striking movie/TV magic is not common at all now. But, gold and platinum were, in deed struck in a serious way this year in the quiet town of Vancouver on the set of the most underappreciated, underrated and misunderestimated ;) show on television today in the form of my generation's Cary and Rita: Tom and Erica. I have to say that I admire them. We have all been witness to countless stories of indiscretions on the sets of film and tv done by actors who don't have a fraction of the chemistry that is UNDENIABLE between Welling and Durance. The will and character of these two young talents are made from tough stuff. If they weren't otherwise involved though, I'd safely bet my entire classic movie collection that these two belong to each other PERIOD.DVD Features:1. Commentary on \"Kandor\" by Callum Blue(Major Zod), writers/producers Al Septien and Turi Meyer2. Commentary on \"Idol\" by Erica Durance(Lois Lane) and showrunners Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson3. \"Kneel Before Zod\" Featurette4. \"Justice for All\" Featurette (Focus on Justice Society of America of Episodes 11 and 12)5. Unaired scenes: Rabid, Roulette, Disciple, Persuasion, Conspiracy, Upgrade, Charade and Salvation6. All 22 Season 9 episodes in anamorphic widescreen on 6 discs with artwork7. Booklet with episode descriptions and dvd contentsEpisode List:1) SAVIOR: GRADE A- ...Tess is the savior of Kandor. Zod is the savior of his Kryptonian army. Chloe savior of organized hero-hood, Oliver- would-be savior down on his luck, Clark the savior of all and unbeknownst to everyone, including her, Lois the savior of Clark.2) METALLO: A ...John Corben - Brian Austin Green as I have never seen him before: confident and oozing sex appeal. After five years since Smallville's Season 4 premiere, Clark Kent finally becomes AWARE of his romantic feelings for Lois Lane.3) RABID: A++ ...Zod's minion releases zombie virus. Please, DO NOT let the gory zombie make up deter you from watching this episode. It is POWERFUL. Clark definitively and literally closes the book on Lana Lang, puts an end to the \"buddy\" relationship he maintained with Lois Lane for five long years and opens the door to his now acknowledged budding love for her. I DARE you to not cry during the rain scene! DELETED SCENES4) ECHO: A- ...Jor-El temporarily gives Clark the power to hear other's thoughts. Encouraged by the attraction for him that Lois has kept gaurded since episode 8.17 Hex, Clark asks her out on a \"not date\" reigniting her crush on him. For her own protection, he ends by standing her up and making her cry. (She shows up at the Daily Planet the next morning wearing sun glasses.) Oliver tries to kill himself.5) ROULETTE: B ...The conclusion of the Oliver downward spiral courtesy of Chloe. Clark and Lois have movie and laundry night. Clark makes Lois cry for the second episode in a row by lying to her about the seriousness of her former boyfriend Oliver's condition. DELETED SCENES6) CROSSFIRE: A++ ...Zod's new company strikes \"sun\" deal with Tess. Chloe meets her hacking match. Oliver gets a sidekick and does his best to reignite his former romance with Lois. And Clark ... he becomes a MAN (This is where Smallville's Clark FINALLY measures up to his original namesake: Clark Gable - Superman creators Siegel and Schuster named and modeled their Man of Steel after the \"King of Hollywood\" - appropriately and deservedly so). The save he does on the roof, his first and last scenes with Lois are three of my all time favorite moments from the entire series.7) KANDOR: B+ ...PRICELESS scene between Clark and Chloe discussing his first kiss with Lois. Entire desert scene is fantastic. Clark continues in his Manhood and holds his father in his arms before he dies, finally appreciating his sacrifice in sending his only son to Earth. COMMENTARY:Callum Blue(Major Zod), writers/ producers Al Septien and Turi Meyer8) IDOL: A++ ...Comic Book PERFECTION. Anne Saunders writer and Glen Winter director deserve and Emmy for this. Erica Durance and Tom Welling deserve a raise. They become the definitive, preeminent and ICONIC Clark Kent and Lois Lane - leaving all former (and quite probably, all future) incarnations in the dust. The guy who plays the D.A. is deliciously cool and sexy (in a menacing way) and Randall, the Daily Planet city editor, always has a fun and funny interaction with his star reporter. The Wonder Twins(and their space monkey Gleek on a cell phone) make an unforgettable appearance. COMMENTARY:Erica Durance(Lois Lane)and showrunners Kelly Souders and Brian Peterson9) PANDORA: A+ ...Heart-pumping from start to finish. This is Tom Welling's best performance to date- and I'm not just talking about the Clark/Lois sex scene! This was an epic episode - sort of Smallville's version of \"Brave New Metropolis\" from Superman the Animated Series - it's only after Lois Lane's disappearance that Superman finally becomes aware of his deep love for her and resolves to actually do something about it. ALL the Tom/Erica scenes were heart-wrenching. Either these two are the best actors the whole of the world has ever seen or they are genuinely in love with each other (much like Lois and Clark were in seasons 4-8 ...everyone around them knew it except them). Not even the classic movie couples I mentioned earlier portrayed being in love as well as these two - except for Humphry Bogart and Lauren Bacall but they actually were the love of each other's lives. (They fell in love at first sight on the set of their first film, \"To Have and Have Not.\" What's more, Bogart turned down the male lead opposite Rita Hayworth in \"Gilda\" - he thought her too captivating and he had just married Bacall.)10) DISCIPLE: A- ...Oliver's past comes back to bite him in the ass. Zod tries to pressure Clark through Lois. Callum Blue rivals Michael Rosenbaum as best show villain ever. He is so much fun to watch! His interactions with Clark and Lois in this and the previous episode are electrifying. They play really well off each other. Never been a Green Arrow fan, but I love Justin Hartley's take on him. He makes you want to hold him - his scenes with Lois were so tenderly bittersweet - it's no wonder she's the love of his life (that is until Black Canary comes around to \"rescue\" him). I also love the big brother/little sister relationship he's developed with Mia. I'm loving Clark more and more each episode. He is fabulous! The way he is with Lois and the way she is with him - it's like these two were magically plucked out of the 1930's-1940's and delivered to 21st century television - beautifully CLASSIC all the way! Writer/producer Jordan Hawley always seems to write an intense Oliver Queen, a clear-headed Clark Kent and a very vulnerable Lois Lane. DELETED SCENES11) SOCIETY (ABSOLUTE JUSTICE Part 1): A- ...The Justice Society of America led by Hawkman is forced out of retirement by a covert government agency. This episode dragged for the first 30 minutes until Dr.Fate showed up in full uniform. Actor Brent Stait (Dr. Fate) was hands down the MVP. He OWNED every one of his scenes.12) LEGENDS (ABSOLUTE JUSTICE Part 2): A+ ...Of all the \"Smallville University\" alumni, director Tom Welling has become its brightest graduate. After his dismal \"Injustice\" episode last year, he is back to form here. The action sequences are among the series' best and his Lois Lane is always at her sexiest and most vulnerable in his hands. Writer Geoff Johns outdid himself. He clearly loves the material and adores Lois Lane in particular. Her scene with Dr.Fate was simply AWESOME. One thing, though - this is the second episode where Clark strikes a \"Hercules statue\" pose during an action scene (the first was Disciple). Unless he's doing this on purpose, he really needs to quit it because he looks like he's air jogging - it's laugh out loud HILARIOUS!13) WARRIOR: C ...Director Alison Mack and writer Brian Miller ruined the Zatanna character with this one episode. I liked her in last year's \"Hex\" but here, they portrayed her as a cheap, selfish, domineering slut. Even more annoying was Mack's attempt to regress Clark to clueless wuss of seasons 1-8. I do understand the choice of Zatanna to be the troublemaker to the iconic romance, though. Other than Laura Vandervoort who played Clark's cousin, Serinda Swan is the only other actress to ever appear on the show who is as beautiful as Erica Durance so Lois was believably jealous. Thankfully, Lois dressed as Wonder Woman and the Tom/Erica chemistry came to the rescue and made this episode somewhat bearable. However, I DO hope this is Mack's last season on the show - I've never been a fan of her Chloe. Superman does NOT need a controlling \"sidekick,\" a fascist \"Watchtower,\" or a hypocritical \"best friend.\" Producers, in the name of all that is the excellence of the Superman story, get rid of her already!!!!14) PERSUASION: A- ...Clark is infected by gemstone kryptonite giving him the power of persuasion. Though every one of his persuasive instances backfire on him, three good things do come out - 1.Tess learns that Clark's power will disappear if her towers go online 2.Chloe shows her true colors 3.Lois opens up to Clark causing them to draw closer. BEAUTIFULLY written and directed episode by Anne Saunders and Christopher Petry. Louis Febre outdid himself with the musical score. This is the best Clark Kent character advancement story thus far. DELETED SCENES15) CONSPIRACY: B+ ...A doctor the Kandorians experimented on takes revenge by abducting three of them. Then, he kidnaps Lois Lane to get her to write about the alien invasion. Zod tracks them down, gets shot, then Clark shows up in time to save his life, though it ends up having major, unforeseen repercussions. Clark and Lois agree to keep some mystery in their romance since both are aware of secrets neither is willing to share. The Tom/Erica chemistry comes to a level of mature sexiness. DELETED SCENES16) ESCAPE: B- ...Clark sings about Lois in the shower! HA!! It's the funniest scene ever! This is the first Chloe-centric episode in the show's history that I actually didn't mind because it's sprinkled with GOLDEN Clark/Lois scenes and it establishes the actual nature of each couple on the show for the rest of the season - Tess/Zod:Power merger; Chloe/Oliver:Friends with benefits; Lois/Clark:Old fashioned romantic love. Zod changes his strategy for world domination by impersonating the Blur. Actress Odessa Rae has a dual role as the inn keeper and the Silver Banshee. She underplayed both parts very nicely and effectively.17) CHECKMATE: B+ ...It appears that the powers that be on the show are now trying to turn Oliver and Chloe into \"Lois and Clark the Sequel.\" It's not working. Hartley's and Mack's interaction with each other is just - blah. In truth, Oliver's scenes with Tess had much more spark and were considerably MUCH MORE fun to watch. Clark's action sequence was the highlight - it really did look like a comic book page come to life. However, Clark targetting Tess in every episode has gotten old and it was just plain STUPID to have him, yet again, throw a TOTALLY UNNECESSARY apology at Chloe of all people! The best part of this episode was the Martian Manhunter as played by Phil Morris. Hoped he'd be a regular next season (In the animated \"Justice League\" series, Jonn Jonz was in charge of the Watchtower)...by now it became obvious that shrump chloe was the writers' pride and joy - they should have just spared us millions of Superman fans and written a seperate show exclusively for her few thousand fans.18) UPGRADE: B+ ...Brian Austin Green returns as John Corben/Metallo. It's amazing how actress Erica Durance seems to have a special gift for generating chemistry with every one of the male actors she has ever been paired up with on this show. Green's chemistry with her is really good - not off the charts, smoldering perfection like Welling's but REALLY good, nonetheless. In fact, it's as good as the Lois/Oliver vibe of season 6. Once this show wraps, I hope they do a dramatic movie together. The first four minutes of this episode are killer! There's only one Clark/Lois scene but it's one of the BEST! Michael Rohl, who also directed \"Rabid\" and \"Crossfire,\" seems to have the best handle on how to create the sexiest of all Lane/Kent moments. And, writers Andrew Landis and Julia Swift (who also penned \"Pandora\") have earned their stripes in writing Clark Kent's manhood at its RAWEST. Officially went way over in setting Chloe on a pedestal but - whatever - that Clark/Lois \"wake up call\" scene was just TOO GOOD!!! DELETED SCENES19) CHARADE: A- ...Clark is jealous of himself - bringing the perrenial Superman/Clark Kent/Lois Lane \"Triangle Built for Two\" to Smallville. Lois in a playboy bunny suit. Tess, like the rest of us, is baffled why heroes keep Chloe around. Guest star Dylan Neal (Ray Sacks) is really HOT - for an older guy. And executive producer and showrunner Brian Peterson makes his directorial debut. Writers/producers Holly Henderson and Don Whitehead wrote this as a sequel to the season's earlier episode, \"Idol.\" All the scenes with Clark and/or Lois felt like an old-fashioned, classic Superman show - and that is a high compliment. DELETED SCENES20) SACRIFICE: B+ ...Checkmate forces a Watchtower meltdown while Tess and Chloe are trapped inside. Tess names Chloe Plain Jane. Zod destroys Checkmate Headquarters. Major Zod becomes the full on, sadistic \"General Zod\" by killing his pregnant lover, Faeora, because she refused to kneel before him. Then, he unites his army and gives them all super powers. In short, all hell breaks loose.21) HOSTAGE: A- ...Annette O'Toole returns as Martha Kent (the Red Queen) and her real-life husband, Michael McKean returns as Perry White. The future Daily Planet Editor-in-Chief meets intrepid reporter Lois Lane. Jor-El's ace card against Zod's superpowered army \"the Book of Rao\" is recovered by the Red Queen (Ma Kent) and she gives it to her son, Clark - but with a warning.22) SALVATION: A++ ...Opening teaser genuinely ICONIC sequence. The Justice League and the Justice Society unite in cameos. MAGNIFICENT season finale. Producers/writers Al Septien and Turi Meyer also wrote season 7's best episode, \"Apocalypse.\" Greg Beeman (Seasons 1-5 veteran director/producer) returned to helm this episode. His love and respect for the show, the characters and the actors shined through. He lovingly framed each scene with care, style and precision. WELL DONE! These were, quite simply, the GREATEST 22 hours of Superman entertainment EVER put on screen - and he hasn't even worn the suit yet. DELETED SCENESDirected at Erica Durance - should she ever read this: You once said in an interview that three actresses you admired were angelina jolie, jessica lange and ashley judd. I whole-heartedly hope that the day will come when you stop holding those three as your standards for acting success. Granted, that they have managed to gain name recognition and carve out a fan base for themselves. However, in all honesty, they don't hold a candle to what has been divinely gifted to you: a presence and inner radiance that harkens Ginger Rogers, Hedy Lamarr and especially, Rita Hayworth. If you must have acting role models, I wish you'll look to these truly great ladies whose legend has stood the test of time and are still the measure for cinematic grace, beauty and womanly grit. With all due respect, those three you mentioned will be eventually forgotten or, at best, thrown on the pile of dime a dozen performers who care more about their liberal political standing and panhandeling to the elite critics and \"method\" actor house of worship than they do about the art and joy of cinema and the respect owed to its audience. I hope you nurture your spirit, your heart, your connection to God and untether yourself from those who would use you to benefit themselves while holding you back and even bringing you harm. True love is not blind nor brainless, foolish, selfish, fearful, or cruel and will never ask you to allow something that will cause you embarrassment and leave you vulnerable to needless criticism. If ever in doubt, examine your own experience as Lois with Superman. You don't need to rely on ham actors and talent-poor wannabe \"film makers\" to empower yourself to draw from the natural wealth of talent deposited in you for acting, producing and you should try your own hand at writing and directing. It's because of your innate character that you embodied Lois Lane from the very first scene but it wasn't until Welling worked with you in Season 7 \"Apocalypse\" and Michael Rohl worked with you in Season 8 \"Bloodline\" that your raw talent for comedy and drama began to mature before our eyes. Mistakes are a fact of life but setting things right is what takes us from mediocrity to greatness. Respectfully, all the best to you.Directed at Tom Welling - should he ever read this: I'm sorry it took 8 years for me to become one of your fans but really, the fault lies with your seasons 1-8 writers/producers and your seasons 1-8 performance as Clark Kent. Your show's original theme, \"Before Superman\" was fine for the first 5 seasons and while season 6 gave hope that the show was moving to the next stage in Superman's development (i.e. Justice League, Jimmy Olsen, kissing Lois Lane and her becoming a reporter)season 7 backslided in most of what had been accomplished. Except for Lois at the Daily Planet, Michael Cassidy (After you in Season 9, THE most gorgeous man to ever grace the Smallville screen!), Supergirl and the directed-by-you episode \"Apocalypse\" - all of season 7 really, really sucked ROTTEN eggs! With the exodus of Al, Miles, Glover, Kreuk and Rosenbaum, my hope was renewed that Superman was finally on the horizon. Season 8's episodes 1-11 were the most promising string of stories in your show's history UP TO THAT POINT but then your \"supergenius\" show runners took a hatchet to their own show and maliciously destroyed all the good progress that had been made with the incredibly horrendous episodes 12-14. The Mack-directed-episode 8.13 Power was PARTICULARLY HORRIBLE!!! Your hack producers claimed that it was \"female empowerment\" themed. Uh, well, speaking as a young, empowered woman myself, I can tell you that to portray a woman who feels soooo inferior to the man she loves that she makes the conscious, deliberate decision to LITERALLY turn herself inside out in a desperate attempt to be his equal is not only SOOOO NOT empowering but it is morosely tragic and insulting!!! It simply had no place in the Superman story. Why? Did you let them do that?! Except for \"Hex,\" \"Stiletto\" and your confession scene with Erica in \"Infamous,\" the rest of the season really sucked and your Clark went back to being a (super) dork! I almost wished that Durance's Lois Lane move to Gotham City to date Batman because your seasons 1-8 Clark most certainly did NOT deserve her!! Superman was NEVER supposed to be an enabler of twisted behavior! He loves and celebrates all good women just as they are - especially his INHERENT equal, Lois Lane. Lois is to Wonder Woman what Batman is to Superman - the mortal versions of the most powerful, heroic figures in the world. Ms.Lane has never needed and never will need an artificial, skin-grafted \"super suit\" to stand toe to toe with her Man of Steel. Perhaps the only redeeming quality of that miserably misguided arc is Smallville's(inadvertant) point that Lana Lang was, is and always will be Clark's toxic kryptonite whereas Lois Lane was, is and forever will be Superman's strengthening, life-giving, human, yellow sun... Enter Season 9. Clark Kent is NOW assertive, passionate, full of conviction, intelligent, sexy, proactive and most phenomenally, emotionally strong -in other words, the male version of Lois Lane. One of your producers said that Season 9 Clark met HIS match in Lois. I couldn't disagree with that more. I see it as Season 9 Clark FINALLY embracing his core essence and thus became HER match in the process. Wow. For a guy who started this show not even being a Superman fan, with your role as co-executive producer, director and now STELLAR performance this season, you have become Superman's greatest fan and for that, I am grateful. Now, if you're interested in keeping me as your fan, here are some suggestions: #1 You being a private person is a good thing. I don't need to know too much about you. I'm glad you're taking a cue from the classic conservative stars of Hollywood's Golden Age. #2 Please, NEVER disrespect me by trying to set yourself up as the head of a \"Tom Welling political voting block.\" (That's how Brandon Routh lost my fandom - permanently.)As the private citizen that you are, if you want to start endorsing politicians or become one yourself, it's your right - just don't count on my vote (especially if you turn out to be a closet liberal). Take a page from the great Ronald Reagan - choose entertainment OR politics and you may do each well but please don't mix them. #3 Please. PLEASE. NEVER stop being a gentleman. They seem so rare now a days both in real life and entertainment. That's why I mostly stick with pre 1965 classic movies. It may be an unpopular view but the truth is, they DON'T make them like they used to. But, hey, here's hoping you and the beautiful Erica Durance can start a new trend, or rather ... bring back a classic. And, here's hoping you capture lightning in a bottle two seasons in a row with season 10 - which I hope will end with Erica Durance in a wedding dress and of course you flying in the classic Superman suit. (A Louis Febre version of John Williams' Lois/Superman theme music will be nice, too.) All in all, well done, Smallville. Well done.",

    "review/text": "Superman has always fascinated me, and Smallville used to be an interesting series. But now, Clark Kent seems more a native of Dullsville as he inhabits the great city of Insipidopolis working (occasionally) a job for which he is completely unqualified and speeding around the city tackling bad guys while dressed like a Goth flasher and still trying to figure out why he's on Earth.Superman is implausible by definition, and Smallville has always stretched the limits of reason, to whit: twenty-five-year-old actors playing high school freshman, Chloe spending four years as school editor and having 24/7 access to the school (not to mention her impossible abilities as a computer hacker), Tess Harper seemingly as super as Superman, etc. But the series has become insanely implausible. I can accept the premise of a man with super strength and who can fly through the air (except that by season 9 Clark still can't fly although he did in previous seasons when affected by turquoise or ecru or whatever color d'jour of kryptonite was available). That is the Superman story, after all. What I can't accept is the human characters, episode after episode, getting socked in the head by super-villains and thusly smashed into a wall fifteen feet across the room only to rise with nothing more than a few cuts on their faces that likely will heal before the end of the show and certainly by the next one. Lois has been clobbered so often that by episode 9 she should look like an NHL goalie that never wore a mask and the have mental acuity of an Alzheimer's victim. Lana was possessed so many times that she should have left the show a raving lunatic. And exactly how does Chloe earn a living? I've wearied of watching 120 lb. women routinely beat the daylights out of 200 lb. muscular men themselves trained in the martial arts. And how does the disembodied Jor-El carry on perpetual interactive conversations with Clark (not to mention that he is as quixotic as the fictional character that generated that adjective)? It would seem from the number of Krytonians that keep appearing that all the inhabitants of Krypton escaped before the planet exploded. And enough with the kryptonite that seems to be more common on Earth than granite. It would seem by now that half of planet Earth knows Clark's secret. Since Clark has never adopted the traditional wimpy persona, he'll never be able to adopt a dual identity. I could go on, but you get the point. Writers are straining for ideas to keep the show running, and they're failing.I canceled Smallville from my Netflix list mid-ninth season. I used to enjoy it, but I've seen enough. It's grown old, stale, and, frankly, really stupid.",

    "review/text": "SPOILERS FOLLOWThe ninth season of \"Smallville\" is loaded with episodes that are either very good or great, with maybe three shows(literally) that are awful.The season kicks off with \"Savior,\" a show that does not feature Clark strongly but is a great introduction for (at first)Major Zod. Here played by very talented British actor Callum Blue, this season marks the first time the iconic \"Superman\" villain has truly appeared on the series(he was first mentioned in Season Five, and very briefly played by Lex Luthor actor Michael Rosenbaum at the end of Season Five and the beginning of Season Six). Zod's interactions with the show's resident conflicted antagonist Tess Mercer in this episode and throughout the season are fun to watch.Other highlights for the season include \"Metallo,\" in which Brian Austin Green(\"Beverly Hills 90210,\" \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\") plays the \"Superman\" antagonist very well. Other great episodes include \"Crossfire\" and \"Idol,\" the latter episode featuring the Wonder Twins Zan and Jayna for the first time on \"Smallville.\" I had real doubts about this pair on the show, but it works beautifully. \"Charade\" is a magnificent introduction for comic book character Maxwell Lord, and \"Hostage\" returns to Mr. Lord and also brings back two longtime favorites who had been absent from the show. Additionally, \"Absolute Justice\" is a series milestone. Two episodes (\"Society and \"Legends\")seamlessly woven into the series' first genuine two-hour episode by comic book writer Geoff Johns, it is an awesome event that also features Pam Grier as villain Amanda Waller.The three weakest episodes of the season are \"Rabid,\" \"Warrior,\" and \"Escape.\" These shows are a bad combination of trite and offensive which stick out badly in an otherwise terrific season.Also featuring a great season finale called \"Salvation\" and notably the first season to give star Tom Welling official producing credits, the ninth season of \"Smallville\" is virtually flawless.",

That is the only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars.To save it though, the season really did ramp up on the thrills and action, getting you closer to see that long awaited switch from Kent Clark to Superman.

    "review/summary": "A Definite Step in the Right Direction",
    "review/text": "Everyone who's seen this season dislikes something about it. And, just like any season of Smallville, there are plenty of things to dislike. Plotholes, filler episodes, etc. However, the show's ninth season shines for what it gets right.Finally, we see Tom Welling wearing the S. That's worth a thousand points right there. Sure, the man-in-black look might seem strange at first (The Batman comparisons have been overdone). However, when you look at the end of season eight, it really does make sense. The last time we saw Clark, he had just left Jimmy's funeral. Mourning (and, therefore, dressed in black) he announced that his human identity was finished. Naturally, when we see him at the start of season nine, he has jumped headfirst into his Kryptonian identity, sporting the S shield while retaining the black clothes. You can say he's mourning the \"death\" of Clark Kent. You can say he's mourning Jimmy. You can say whatever you want. But no mater what you say, you can't deny that any outfit with the S emblem is a step above the red-and-blue ensemble we've been overexposed to since the beginning.Clark's character is really the strongest part of this season. He doesn't take the backseat as much as he did in the earlier seasons (namely seven). We finally see him standing up for his beliefs and sticking to them. He comes to some very Superman-ly decisions; he thinks things through. Most importantly, he makes me believe that he could be a superhero by the end of next year. Let's hope the writers don't mess that up.Another strong point of the season is the Lois and Clark relationship. Sure, it has its missteps. There are a few scenes where the chemistry seems off. This is probably due to poor directing. In the majority of the scenes, however, Tom Welling and Erica Durance go together like... well, Lois and Clark. It's fun to watch, and it reminds us viewers of their impending destiny.Zod is a wonderful villain played marvelously by Callum Blue. His story is told too slowly or too quickly at times. However, his performances are consistently great to watch. I only wish he could have interacted with the main cast more often. Instead, we get scene after scene with him and Tess. Initially, this is fun. Eventually, however, their relationship is confusing and (to be honest) boring. What does he want? What does she want? Who knows?In fact, that's the biggest problem of season nine: determining the characters' motivations. Tess in particular is nearly impossible to figure out. One day, she's helping Clark save the world. The next day, she's helping Zod. The day after that... your guess is as good as mine. Chloe is in a similar rut, as well. I've consistently liked her character until this season. Gone is the fun, eager-to-help Chloe. She has been replaced with a rather abrasive, confusing character who I cannot identify with whatsoever. Sure, the death of her husband could be to blame for this. But Jimmy is literally mentioned a couple of times throughout the entire season. In my opinion, Clark seems to mourn for Jimmy's death more than anyone; Chloe gets three new love interests this season, if you really think about it. Only one of them amounts to anything past an episode or so, but still... It's pretty unsettling to think that the Chloe I have enjoyed viewing for so many years has become so shallow and fickle. The writers definitely lose some points on that one.Oliver, as usual, takes up way too much screen time for my liking and only serves to weigh the story down. It is enjoyable, at times, to watch him talk things out with Clark. More often than not, however, he seems to slow down the show's pace and I find myself wishing he would just go away for awhile. No offense to Justin Hartley. He's a great actor and I really do like Oliver as a character. I just think it's time for Clark to be the definitive star of the show.That's the problem I had with this year's big promotion episode: Absolute Justice. Technically, it's two episodes. Some will even claim that it's a movie, but it's really not. If you take Absolute Justice out of context, it makes absolutely no sense to any viewers unfamiliar with Smallville. In fact, it makes little sense to followers of the show. It's eighty-something minutes of information about characters that, in my opinion, aren't that interesting. Does Smallville really need Hawkman and Stargirl? Come on.Aside from these hiccups, season nine is a vast improvement over season eight. The majority of its episodes are a blast to watch, and it's wonderful to watch Clark move closer and closer to his destiny. The music this year has been top-notch, just like the special effects and (most of) the acting. The producers really brought a darker tone to the show this year, and I think it's been great for Smallville. Not to mention that the plotholes are nowhere near as numerous as the loose ends tied. This season, we learn why Clark can't fly yet. We see Martha Kent again. We see Perry White return the favor he's been owing to Clark for seasons. And... (spoiler ahead) we get some teases as to Lex's whereabouts.Bottom line, check out season nine. If you've watched Smallville this long, you owe it to yourself anyway.",

    "review/text": "Season 9 has definitely matured from Season 8, rightfully so. To those who have not seen Season 9 episodes, prepare yourself for GOOD TIMES. There is plenty of ACTION, SUSPENSE, COMEDY (Hawkman), DRAMA and ROMANCE to keep you watching and wanting more. Apart from the occasional filler episodes, this season contains an on-going story that is typically re-capped with the next episode. Although this show in general does not literally follow every circumstance or experience faithfully, it is an opportunity to see how other options are able to develop. Chloe, one of the foundational characters to this show, finally gets some much deserved guy action in Season 9. I agree with most fans that the actors are very talented, unpretentious, and especially easy on the eyes which make for a perfect combination to BOTH female and male viewers. The new actors on this season are a perfect fit for their respective character, especially general Zod, who is refreshingly engaging. I especially love the underlying principles that still remain true to each season, especially in Season 9: the HUMBLENESS, BRAVENESS, SACRIFICE, DEVOTION, and WEAKNESS that make the MAN OF STEEL wonderfully human.",

Disturbingly, the main characters have also degenerated with the worst being, most unfortunately, Clark/Superman/Kent. The series appears to have lost its primary focus of Clark becoming the true comic book hero that loyal patrons, the world over, have loved for more than seven decades. This is what happens when the producers and writers attempt to recast a super icon into an ordinary, and dull, \"reality\" hero. Perhaps season ten shall redeem the series with renewed focus on the true Superman story . . .",

It is clear that the script writers have run out of ideas.Daniel James Callum Blue (Zod) is a truly bad actor and the worst actor they could have chosen to portray \"Zod\". He does by no means remotely justify or fit into the initial portrayed character of \"Zod\". To make it simple he is no \"Zod\" and besides the demise of the story line, is one of the major contributors to the disaster of this season.The Kryptonians are supposed to be a highly evolve race. They are beyond light sabers and laser guns, yet in season 9 they are portrayed as ordinary people no different from us. The soldiers are pretty much normal GI's wearing ordinary uniforms that are pretty much on par with \"freedom\" fighters in Africa. The US marines are a whole lot more sophisticated and better equipped than these Kryptonians. It is a sad state of affairs.If you want fond memories of the Smallville saga, don't pursue any further seasons. Season 10 is equally disappointing.",

Probably more so than the previous season, it lifts Clark up into a life as an adult, a man with responsibilities, and onto his destiny as the Man of Steel.Clark will live long enough with the colours red and blue later on in life, so he discarded his colours for the time being. Now he's just a 'blur' instead of the 'red/blue blur'. The darker clothes make him more mature in a way, and less of a target to others. Red and blue can attract unwanted attention after all :)I've seen bits and pieces of what is to come, and read some of the stories about the other episodes in the booklet that came with it... I must say, I can't wait to see the rest...I've been a fan since it came out with the first season, and I'll be a fan for as long as I live...The Superman myth has always inspired me, but Smallville has done an incredibly great job in retelling the story of the Man of Steel. It's not all as we know it from the Marvell comics and the movies, but that's nothing bad... it's quite the opposite... it deepens the myth, it adds colour, it inspires...May all of you be inspired too :)",

    "review/text": "I have stuck with this show from the beginning, and now I am torn about how I feel. The show looks fantastic as always; all of the scenes and shots look amazing. The acting is not the problem. All of the cast are doing a great job. There are several annoying problems with the storyline that prevent me from really enjoying this.First, Clark should be able to fly by now. I know, I know, there was that \"no flights, no tights\" rule back in 2001. I also know that no one then could have guessed that this show would have made it nine seasons. Kara is a teenager and she can fly. Clark is about 24 by now, so he should be able to fly.Second, there are so many twists and turns in the plot that you would need a notebook and a flowchart to keep track of it all. I miss the early years when all you had to keep track of was how evil Lex was this week, and the freak of the week that would either be dead or in the loony bin by the end of the episode.Also, is Oliver's secret the worst kept secret in all of Metropolis? Even Lois knows that one. It seems he's pretty casual about admitting who he is.Now that I've complained, here's what I liked about this season. I did like the \"Absolute Justice\" two-parter. Even though I had not even heard of any of the comic book heroes in it, I still enjoyed it a lot. I like Lois and Clark's romance progressing, and I also like that Lois figured out Clark's secret. Thankfully they did not drag out the angst as much as with Lana. Major Zod actually was a better addition than I thought he would be. The \"is he evil or not\" uncertainty was interesting.So, for season 10, the last one, I get the feeling that they are going to let it all hang out; pull out all the stops and go for broke. I think it will be the best one yet. My questions are, how long will we have to wait to see Clark flying? How will anyone be fooled by Clark's disguise of a pair of glasses, when he has not worn them for all these years? How long until Lois clues Clark in that she knows his secret? It'll be interesting to find out.",

    "review/text": "Krypton's last survivors have decided to make Earth their new home. But Zod is obsessed with his people receiving the same powers that Clark possesses. So Zod has decided to transform Earth, without a care about what happens to all of humanity. Meanwhile, back at the Daily Planet, Lois and Clark's relationship develops. And many DC Comic heroes (the Wonder Twins, Zatanna, and the JSA) make guest appearances.As in each season of this long-running series, Clark goes through a lot of changes - most notably with his relationship with Lois. Clark, the man-who-will-become-Superman, juggles his relationship with Lois, dealing with the recent Kryptonian residents, his day job (which we rarely see him doing) and crime fighting as \"The Blur.\" Zod and Tess are up to more scheming and no good. Chloe and Oliver round out the rest of season's regular cast, whose relationship gears up this season as well.This set contains all 21 episodes from this action-packed season. It's a solid show with fantastic actors. Now that Clark and Lois have paired up, it's high time that Clark trade in the drab black outfit and start donning his primary colors. So few science fiction shows last this long, but it's not hard to see why. Tom Welling is a stellar Clark Kent. And each season continues to improve on the last. While some former costars are missed, this has been one of my favorite mixes of characters. The Smallville cast has incredible chemistry - and dissonance - in all the right places.",

And Perry White is Martha Kent's boyfriend?? WTF??Okay... I think that's it for the bad stuff. Really, that's it? I thought I'd have more to complain about, but thinking back... Oh wait, one more thing:Clark needs to fly already. And PLEASE, in season 10 don't make us wait until the final episode for him to fly. Producers, read these reviews. Pay attention. Clark. Airborne. Do it.That's it. Now... Let's continue...Some people are seeing parallels to Batman where there are none, slamming this season with one or two stars when they are imagining things. Go to Google Images. Type in \"superman black uniform\", look carefully and then STFU. I like the black outfit, and the gothy Superman crest on the black tee. Grow up people, seriously.I have never considered Oliver Queen as a poor-man's Bruce Wayne, there is no comparison except that Green Arrow and Batman have similar alter egos, but completely different attitudes and origins.A big moment in \"Smallville\", as far as I am concerned, was in season 8 when Oliver asked Chloe her to give up her life as a reporter, and she says yes, takes a headset, all the heroes give their code names and Chloe says \"Watchtower is officially online.\" I jumped up and cheered.My wife looked at me funny, and then I explained to her what Watchtower was and that anything that hints at the JLA makes me happy. And you know what? Chloe DESERVES the honor of being the original Watchtower, at least on \"Smallville\". She's earned it. So, imagine my disappointment that they never went anywhere with this beyond a couple of times where Chloe meddles in the heroes' lives. She doesn't do much Watchtower-ing in this season though she does contribute. It's not her fault. I fear that Chloe is becoming obsolete. I see them trying to keep her interesting but the Superman story is evolving beyond the old High School buddies and is getting to be to big for her. I don't expect to see much of her in Season 10, which would be too bad.I loved the Wonder Twins, and how they were used in Season 9, also Hawkman, and Dr. Fate from the Golden Age came into it and gave it a real DC feel, and again went some distance to hint at the formation of the JLA, though I realize that it really won't happen until Clark is Superman, and THAT isn't likely to happen until the very end of season 10.Callum Blue was excellent as Zod, and I thought that tricking Lois into believing that he was \"The Blur\" was particularly cool. The battle with Zod, and the season finale has really whet my appetite for season 10, but overall, you can feel that the series is running out of ideas, winding down.Season 9 was a very good season. Some of it was weaksauce and it could have been better, so I'm giving it four out of five, which may actually be generous. While some of the little elements were very entertaining, the overall plot, the main throughline was not all it could have been. I hope 10 gives us a season, and a series finale that we won't forget. Smallville is a terrific show, let's hope it ends that way.",

This was about the middle of season 8. After about 5 episodes, I was completely hooked. I couldn't wait for the next episode to finish downloading so I could watch it. I would get frustrated that it wasn't downloading fast enough. And I vowed to watch every single episode through the end of season 8 before Season 9 came out so I could watch Season 9 with the rest of the world on Friday nights. Obviously I was hooked lol.So time comes for season 9 to roll around, i start to watch it. And lo and behold, this season has blown the other 8 seasons out of the water. Granted there are a few slow moments, some of the more Chloe and Oliver-centric episodes coming to mind, but they were still awesome. EVERY single episode in this season has been awesome, and Rabid and Pandora are my 2 favorite episodes of the entire show.Callum Blue as Zod. Seems to be a controversial choice. Personally, I started watching Callum Blue as Mason on Dead Like Me and I loved his portrayal of that character, it was stellar. So when I started watching this season, i expected good things from him. Granted Zod is a far cry from Mason. And he did not disappoint, he is playing the character awesome. Granted it's interesting to watch him in a serious role and not boozed out or high all the time, but still fun to watch him go from a young major to the villain we all know and hate across the season. *Spoiler* Him killing his (future) wife was sad, because she was pregnant, and Faora was incapable later in life, hence creation of Doomsday. But that was a very well written dramatic moment. All in all, I'd say he makes a GREAT villain. Much better than last year's Davis Bloome character, who i couldn't STAND. Davis Bloome seemed to bland of a character, not enough going on personality wise.Overall, episodes done perfectly:Savior, Metallo, Rabid, Crossfire, Kandor, Pandora, Disciple, Absolute Justice, Persuasion, Conspiracy, Escape, Upgrade, SacrificeEpisodes could have been done better:Echo, Roulette, Idol, Warrior, Checkmate, Charade, HostageDon't get me wrong though, the entire season is awesome, there were just things i didn't like about the second list, but still great episodes worth watching. Here's to season finale in 3 days with all out war between Clark and the Kandorians, i can't wait.",

I love how they aren't afraid to show the bleakness of life without Clark Kent. I love how dark they take this season. IN this epi we find out all about Lois' dreams. We see that her jump to the future shows a destroyed world by the Kryptonian's and how fractured Clark, Oliver and Chloe have become. The year jump shows how far apart they've become. I love the scenes between Lois & Clark here as Clark reveals how he \"died\" when Lois vanished in the season 8 finale. Tom Welling does a great job showing how bleak Clark's life has become and who doesn't like the love scenes between he and Lois. It's a highlight of the series. I'm not a fanatic about the Superman mythos...I just love good storytelling and Smallville give us this. Even in it's \"worst\" seasons there are always great episodes to watch. THis is one of the best series around from a storytelling perspective which is why I'm surprised it's not more popular. THis shouldn't be missed...you really should start with season 1 and buy each subsequent season because the stories just get better and it's nice to see Clark Kent grow up and mature into the hero most of us know...Superman.",

The sexual tension between Lois and Clark really keeps you waiting for something to happen between them. The special effects are great. The characters from Krypton are always challenging Clark and the challenges that Clark (The Blur) must face keeps you guessing at how will Clark win and what trouble will Lois get into and require a rescue by The Blur.

I have no history to judge whether it is done right or not so I'm able to enjoy what they do here. Telling a small story about the history of the JSA really hit that nostalgia button especially the way they filmed this but what I really liked was how they humanized these \"heroes\" into flawed characters. I like that our heroes are not always perfect...that they also struggle with decisions. I think that's what Smallville does well with Clark Kent...shows how his life has been filled with doubts and struggles and heartbreak...but that he continues to move forward despite it all...still making mistakes but always striving to do better. He puts one foot in front of the other even though he sometimes feels paralyzed with doubts and with the weight of what's on his shoulders in this story. Clark Kent is a flawed character in this Superman story and I'm glad Smallville producers went this route because it humanizes him and thus makes him more likeable as a character...if that's at all possible with this beloved character.",

He smiles, but it is hard to tell whether he is happy or feeling bittersweetly. Then someone finally asks him about the rumors and the story unfolds.This man is an Englishman working against the Nazis just before the official beginning of WWII. He is almost caught and must reach a contact point for more information. However, with men chasing him, he needs some way to throw them off. He stumbles upon a singing gypsy (Marlene Dietrich) who believes the spirits have sent him to her. She does all she can not only to convert him to her gypsy ways but to also make him fall in love with her.This film is definitly not heavily influenced by wartime sentiments. It is more of a romance than anything, very lighthearted and sweet.And how could you not enjoy seeing Dietrich as a pushy gypsy?",

    "review/text": "For starters, this movie took me ages to find. I had to order it. Second, I had decided by the time it came in that I didn't want it anymore. Silly me. This movie is wonderful. Romance, adventure, suspense, and even comedy. The comedic moments were fantastic. Some of them weren't intended to be comic, it appears. The moment where Ray Milland first meets Marlene Dietrich is great. He points a gun at her, and she is calm as always. Then, she decides that he is HER man. The water spirits sent him. Well, they're going to eat fish stew. Seeing as Marlene has given Ray the spoon, she uses her hands. She sticks them right in that nasty stew and crams it in her mouth. Ray looks a wee bit sick. When Marlene wants to get romantic (and almost succeeds), Ray says, &quot;What is that ghastly smell?&quot; Marlene grunts (I guess it's a grunt) and tells him it's her hair, which he smells. Jasmine, violet, and cod liver oil (or something) are what she has put in her hair. Yeccchhh. That is one of the funniest scenes in the film. Romance abounds too, but to start with, it's all one-sided. Marlene rubs Ray with her hands so much, he asks her if she has considered sitting on them. They kiss eventually. Marlene sings (I wouldn't call it singing, it's more of a deep moaning) the title song in Hungarian while playing a zither. Talent abounds in this movie, doesn't it? This is one of the greatest movies I've seen, and I recommend it to everyone.",

At times the film drags by, some supporting players seem to have cotton in their mouths as they speak, and some of the dialogue is inane. Through it all, Dietrich is the soul of this movie, holding it all together in spite of the flaws, to make the whole thing work.

(Her gorgeous legs and bare feet get plenty of look-see throughout the picture.) Set near the beginning of WW II in the Black Forest of Germany, Dietrich helps Ray Milland escape the Nazis and obtain a secret poison gas formula. The plot is a bit thin, but both Milland and especially Dietrich put everything into their roles. The golden earrings are a prop used to help disguise Milland, and when he receives them in a box in London after the war, he knows they come from Dietrich who is waiting for him. It's during his flight back to Germany that he relates the story in flashback. Sure enough, after hiking to the spot he had last left her, years before, Dietrich is waiting for him in her gypsy wagon, and off they ride into the sunset. Worth seeing for the enthusiastic acting of the two principal stars.",

This movie is definitely an escapism World War II movie, yet even today it's great for that purpose. It's a movie that keeps one interested from start to finish. It's well made and black and white adds even more to the fantasy. The plot is good and the love story is great. Although Marlene Dietrich is portrayed as a semi-dirty gypsy, she still appears glamorous. Ray Milland is very handsome as the leading man. It's a movie that just makes you feel good. They just don't make 'em like they used to.",

    "review/text": "This is a wonderful romance-adventure with plenty of comic touches (we see from \"Destry Rides Again\" on that Dietrich got much more opportunity to let her talents as a comedienne shine than she ever had under von Stenberg's tutelage, and this is a good example. Not to be missed; the scene where Ray Milland, as the hero Ralph Denistoun, gets a good whiff of Marlene's hair!) She obviously had a lot of fun playing the role of Lydia (learning to play the zither, among other things), and her enthusiasm carries the film. She just can't stay away from the glamorous makeup job, even as a dusky-skinned Gypsy, but her performance is so strong you really don't mind. The ending is just what you would expect and hope for, and it's tear-jerking, but in a happy way. (Ten gets you one if they were remaking it today, they'd completely mess up the ending in the name of - gack - irony.) Marlene gets to help bust up on Nazis - something she, as a dedicated anti-Nazi, doubtless enjoyed very much - as she helps Milland with his secret mission on the eve of World War II. A very sympathetic portrayal of Gypsies; reference is made, in a foreshadowing kind of way, to the horrific fate they would suffer in the Holocaust along with Jews and other \"undesirables\".",

    "review/text": "GOLDEN EARRINGS is a superior Dietrich showcase, easily holding its own in the timeless ranks of DESIRE, THE DEVIL IS A WOMAN, and BLONDE VENUS. I agree with an earlier reviewer who asserted that only Dietrich could have successfully carried off the role of a rough-edged Gypsy. In the hands of any lesser actress, Dietrich's vibrant Lydia would have been rendered pure camp. The reported off-screen animosity between Dietrich and Milland lends appreciable spark and heat to their on-screen chemistry, and Lydia's empassioned declaration of love takes its rightful place among the most beautiful and moving romantic moments ever captured on film.GOLDEN EARRINGS also boasts an intriguing gender twist which would never find its way into contemporary macho-laced moviemaking. Dietrich's sexually experienced Lydia relentlessly pursues Milland's chaste and uptight character. She rescues him from peril more than once, and, in the end, when his strongest desire is to make her his life partner, he must leave his own civilized world permanently behind and join her in hers.",

    "review/text": "I wish this movie came in single DVD but, alas, it is only available in multiple movie set and I shy away from those. The VHS tape played very well and was great fun. It has been many years since I saw this movie and had forgotten just how good it is. Of course, it's definitely B&W 40s type Hollywoodized stuff but I really enjoyed seeing it again. I've looked at it several times and continue to enjoy the tender love story between these very different people. I don't think I've ever seen Marlena Dietrich in any other movie but I've ordered a set of several others since I liked her in this so much. I guess I always thought she was all accent and smouldering eyes but she was a very good actress and I look forward to seeing the other movies. Weeks later: I see now that Golden Earrings can be purchased in the single DVD and I've ordered it. For all you hopeless romantics who love old movies, don't miss this one. It's one of my absolute favorites.",

    "review/text": "An entertaining movie about the World War I exploits of the ace German pilot Manfred von Richthofen's (aka, the Red Baron) and his main opponent, Canada's Arthur Brown.The aristocratic Von Richthofen is so honor bound that he refuses to use camouflage paint on his planes, because \"a gentleman should never hide from his enemies\" and instead paints them with the brightest colors. The pragmatic, no-nonsense Brown, instead, does not believe in honor or chivalry: he just wants to win.I can't vouch for the complete historical authenticity of this movie - to mention just one instance, the actor portraying Hermann Goering looks nothing at all like the future Reichsmarshall, and his role in the flying circus was not as prominent as the movie implies. But as an entertainment (by the well known horror low budget film director Roger Corman) this movie is certainly well done. Sure, there is some corny dialogue here and there, and having Von Richthofen speak English in the movie with a heavy German accent was probably not the best idea, but the magnificent shots of period planes fighting in the air over the patchwork fields below separated by hedgerows (shot in 1971 with fearless stuntmen, well before digital imagery started appearing in films) more than makes up for this movie's shortcomings. The great color photography is another plus.",

    "review/text": "Ok. Let's take aside the hystorical innacuracies. I know that this is hard, simply because the movie is title \"Von Richthofen and Brown\"!! If the producers had tried to do something not using real names (like \"The Blue Max\"), maybe they could have got away with it.But, since they went for the Red Baron (probably figuring it would help in the box office), the innacuracies are mind boggling. Just to mention two of them: Richthofen, Boelcke, Voss, Goering, Wolff, Lothar and Udet, all in the same squadron at the same time (if they had added Immelmmann, already dead at the time, it would have been marvellous!). Other: the way Voss died. They didn't bother to show the way it happened, that was one of the most famous air battles in history, fighting for ten minutes alone against seven Allied machines.Now, to the movie itself. It has clearly a \"B-Movie\" feel. Of course. It's Corman directing. He can not escape it. It's stronger than him. The screenplay has its flaws. Dialogues are restrained, cliched. But, given the relative short duration of the film, they tried to put a lot of information in it. Photography is anohter matter. It's simply gorgeous. (there is one moment though, in the last battle, when you can see clearly the 1971 cars below in the road. I laughed a lot!).Go for this movie as light entertainment. At least, you get the clear feel that , for the aereal scenes and battle scenes, the producers and director went to great efforts to make it right.",

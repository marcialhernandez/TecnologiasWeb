    "review/text": "Didn't anyone on the set say, \"You know, that whale's tail is retarded!\"?Moby Dick as a pure adventure story. How sad. Didn't anyone read the book? The deviations in this movie from the book are profound and completely dismast the story's importance. The director seems terrified of injecting mood and irony into his narration. His direction was uncreative and uninspired. What a waste.Then there are all the sad details. For instance, sorry folks, Queequeg was not Maori. Wrong culture. Yes, believe it or not, the Pacific is full of very different cultures and Maori does not fit the Queequeg character. It's like making Ahab French. I preferred the 1956 Queequeg. Even though he was obviously a white actor, at least his character was indeterminate--as a character from Moby Dick should be. Moby Dick is not a simple adventure story with straightforward characters. And finally, why was this movie so afraid of doing the ending the way Melville conceived it? Probably because they were so deathly afraid of complicated meaning. Please, respect and dignify your audience with something more challenging. We can handle it.Ted Levine as Starbuck and Hugh Keyes-Burne as Stubb were good cast decisions. The young actor playing Pip did a great job too. Those three, the carpenter and some of the other minor character actors belonged on the boat. The rest should have been thrown overboard, not necessarily for lack of talent, but for being the wrong person for the part. Stewart didn't pull off Ahab. It was a commendable attempt, but he didn't have the focus and moodiness necessary for the part. Stewart is British. That fact still rings through. Ahab in his soul is American. That's one of the major themes of the story. They should stay as close to foundations as possible. Just because he was the commander of the Starship Enterprise shouldn't make him top choice for Captain Ahab.Henry Thomas was too nice and innocent. Ishmael was the narrator of Moby Dick and the narration of Moby Dick is full of profound insight, intelligence, humor, wit, and biting sarcasm. Ishmael was a character, at least he said so, who could be prone to running around town knocking the hats off people's heads, and he was also not the landlubber this movie portrays him as. He'd been to sea before as a sailor. Why change these kind of details? What were they so afraid of? This movie trashes everything important in the book, including the little details.But besides that whale's tail, the movie had some good historical recreations that made it worth getting two stars. Now I want to get ahold of a copy of the 1978 version. I read elsewhere that the Ahab portrayal is pretty good in that one. Making a movie of \"Moby Dick,\" though, seems to be as hopeless as hunting the White Whale. I doubt anyone will ever take us on a true brooding Melvillian Nantucket sleigh ride. In the hands of the right talent, though, there's very fertile ground in Moby Dick for a very creative cinematic experience. It's waiting for someone with the highest caliber of talent and insight. Anyone else should lay their hands off it.",

This pitiful excuse for a movie was made by people who had no knowledge of New England, whaling, whales, or Herman Melville's epic novel. The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill &quot;Moby Dick&quot; are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's &quot;BLAH!&quot; noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale.",

    "review/text": "The tragedy of this film is that, as Patrick Stewart intones in the supplementary material, the vast majority of those seeing it will never read the book. Stewart implies that that is a good thing, and if the film were an artistically and factually valid adaptation of the novel, that would be true. However, it isn't. Why anyone would be motivated to read the novel by seeing this film is beyond me.There isn't space to go into all the deliberate errors and distortions, but a few will suffice to demonstrate the damage done to Melville's masterpiece.Ishmael had been a teacher, true, but he had also had three previous voyages as a seaman on merchant vessels, which Capt. Peleg treats with scorn as being completely unlike service on a whaling vessel. The point is, Ishmael is definitely not the green neophyte protrayed in the film.Peleg was a Quaker, as were most of the Nantucket whaling captains, although it is not clear in the novel if Ahab is also a Quaker. However, Peleg, who is clearly identified as a Quaker, uses \"thee\" and \"thou\" as second person singular in his conversation with Ishmael, not \"ye\", as in the film. This may seem a minor point, but it was a major issue for Quakers, many of whom had been martyred for their faith in earlier times. One of the many ironies noted by Melville in his novel is that men who would not raise a hand against another man even in self-defense were engaged in the horrible, brutal, bloody, terribly dangerous business of killing sperm whales for their oil, a point the movie misses entirely.Melville describes a mutiny on the ship Town-Ho, but while Starbuck contemplates shooting Ahab with a musket, after wrestling with his conscience he backs away from murder, and never openly threatens Ahab. Although Melville does not say so, there is evidence in the novel to suggest that Starbuck is a Quaker, which of course would heighten Starbuck's dilemma.There were no fights among the crew of the Pequod.No one deserted the Pequod.The crew never complained about \"chowder\" for supper. In fact, they would have thought chowder was a delicacy compared to their usual fare of salt pork and hard tack.Why put Fedallah in the film, if you're going to leave out his prophecy and death? Also, he was a Parsee and Ahab's boat crew were Filipino (\"Manilla-men\"), not Chinese.These distortions wouldn't be so bad if they didn't serve to turn the film into a sort of young person's adventure story. The novel deserves better, something made for adults, on the order of Master and Commander. Melville is no doubt now rotating even more rapidly in his grave than he was in 1956, when the first film version was made.",

I have seen the original 1956 movie and read the book and I must say, this verision holds true to the epic journey and intense obession to both previous incarnations. The visual enhancements allow us a greater view of the bane of Ahab's existance moreso than the '56 movie and therefore allowed us to feel the challenge and terror of facing such a huge beast in it's own element. Moby Dick's willingness to turn and attack rather than just escape by diving deep, gives it an almost human quality for retribution against those who would do it harm. Patrick Stewart's Ahab does not appear as \"insane\" as Gregory Peck's, but he is just as intense and in a way, because of that, is a bit more frightening. Overall, Stewart gave an excellent performance and maintained the story's classic status.",

    "review/text": "It's always interesting to watch actors in their attempts to overcome the stigma of being typecast. I suppose it is a serious problem. After all, apocryphal accounts abound about actors who, having played a too memorable part in a movie, such as the woman who played the Wicked Witch of the West in the Wizard of Oz, end up unemployed because no one can see them as anything else.Enter Patrick Stewart. Of late he has thrown himself at such improbable and botched roles as Henry II in a remake of THE LION IN WINTER and Ebenezer Scrooge in A CHRISTMAS CAROL. As bad as these two mistakes were, neither comes remotely close to his misguided decision to assume the role of Ahab in the new MOBY DICK. What emerges is failure before the opening credits have even run their course. I've said it before; you just cannot remake or replace perfection. Gregory Peck's masterful portrayal of Ahab in the 1956 production of MOBY DICK set a standard that has become a generic when discussing or considering the character of Ahab. Period! As good an actor as Stewart can be, as evidenced by his character-defining work in STAR TREK and his portrayal of a Western King Lear in KING OF TEXAS, he just doesn't even come close to pulling it off here. Instead his performance is totally laughable if not consummately pathetic!I hope that this is the last attempt to supplant the original. Mr. Stewart needs to take a deep breath and accept that he just isn't fit to remake every classic role under the sun. And when it comes to this story, and there's certainly no shame in admitting it, it's a big peg leg to fill!THE HORSEMAN",

Franc Roddam's version of Moby Dick is not a remake of Huston's highly overrated film. To say so is like saying that Herman Mellville didn't write the book. This movie is better than most other made-for-cable flicks I've seen, and though it is not without its flaws, it has more dramatic punch and stronger performances than the Huston version. Gregory Peck can be a teriffic actor (To Kill a Mockingbird), but Ahab is far from being his greatest performance, let alone among his greatest roles. It's one of his worst, in fact. Come on, who would believe Ahab as an enemic, muttering (and as Pauline Kael put it) stock company Lincoln? Patrick Stewart is much more convincing in the role, and puts more energy into his work. Roddam changes the sequence of events in the book, but it's told in more detail and is truer to Mellville's book, whereas Huston skims over the material and leaves us with a rushed and unsatisfying story (people who say it is much more faithful to the novel have either never read it, or are relying on what they read from some abridged junior edition). If a person who's not seen the 1998 version, and reads the numerous reviews in favor of Huston's bland film and Peck's awful performance as Ahab, here's a review with a differing viewpoint.",

Passages from the book are borrowed with no surrounding context, becoming meaningless but impressive-sounding speeches. Meaningful characters, events, and symbols are changed into shallow plot devices. It's not the chinese boat crew, it's not Queequeg's hair, it's not even the curious sidetrip to antarctica (???), it's that important elements of the book are mercilessly twisted into interesting screen shots or one liners that look or sound deep, but are either meaningless in the context of the movie or, worse yet, entirely change the meaning into something other than Melville's. The main problem with this movie is the title - for it is a false Moby Dick. It's an entertaining film in its own right, although certainly with many problems (like said line which are impressive but without context) but it is Moby dick in neither plot nor theme. I will admit that this is not a novel that can easily be done justice on screen (it just doesn't translate well), but what this film does is inexcusable.",

    "review/text": "One of the problems with Moby Dick as a novel is that it is more of a philosophical essay rather than a straight narative. Of the 133 chapters, only the last two chapters as well as the first few, tell the very famous story of the chasing of the white whale. Melville is less interested in character development than commentary making it a very difficult and complex read to truly absorb the entire message. The point is, this is NOT an easy book to make into a film.In this latest version, Patrick Stewart takes the helm, not as Captain Pickard of Star Trek, but the famous Captain Ahab. Unfortunately, the producers obviously told Mr. Stewart that Captain Ahab is chasing after a great white ham and he must play it accordingly. Stewart the loyal actor, takes the advice, and hams it up so badly that the film is almost unwatchable. On top of that, nothing new is added to this version but you may not notice that since Stewart's performance gets so much in the way of everything else, that he makes William Shatner seem like an understated actor.About the only highlight is Gregory Peck (who makes a great cameo in this version as the minister) appears. Peck more properly captured the bitter, somber obsession of Ahab in the 1956 version as compared to Stewart who never seems to really know how to play this part. It's unfortunate because Stewart really can act, but I suspect ego may have gotten in the way of this one!Finally let me not put the entire blaim on Stewart. The reality is that this version just doesn't work and I can't blaim the production team too much as Moby Dick is a brutally hard novel to bring to the screen.",

    "review/text": "I was a bit concerned since this version comes out of Korea, but I must say the technical quality of the DVD was fine. it was very easy to turn off the Korean subtitles (I do read Korean and speak it a bit, but I find the subtitles distracting), and from that point on, it was technically a fine DVD.In terms of the acting, this is my favorite version, with Gregory Peck's version a close second. Peck is more of a smoldering, deep Ahab. Stewart is a fiery, charismatic Ahab. When Quequeg comes out of his death trance and crawls over to Ahab and proclaims, \"Me sabe. You god. You god\" it's totally believable. Stewart has that kind of presence. Even though everyone on board the ship thinks Ahab is crazy, they are willing to follow him to the death. It made me think of the power Adolph Hitler must have had in 1930s Germany.There are of course a few artistic liberties - variations from Melville's original story. But I do not think any of these detract from the essential story. If you have read Melville, you will enjoy this re-telling. And if you have never waded through Melville's prose, you will find in this version why Moby Dick continues to be a story that is told again, and again, and again. Even if you have the Gregory Peck version (and I hope you do), you will want to buy this one. It's a great version and much superior to some which have come later, IMHO.",

    "review/text": "I was recovering from a nearly-fatal illness in 1998, and I needed cheering up - this film did it. MOBY DICK (1998) is a fine, fine version. It is a perennial favorite and I like alternating it with the Gregory Peck version I grew up watching - the only shame is I cannot get the John Barrymore 'prequel' to MOBY DICK (1930) on DVD.In short, Patrick Stewart is perhaps the only weak link here. An atrocious choice for Ahab; Stewart is not that great an actor in my opinion. Henry Thomas as Ishmael is a revelation and as close as I've ever seen anyone get to that role (the biggest insult was seeing Ishmael presented as an old codger in THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN).Piripi Waretini is brilliant as Queequeg, and one actually can envision a romantic relationship between Waretini and Thomas (which was one of Melville's intentions). The inclusion of the slithery Chinese crewmen and the the Indian Tashtego (Matthew E. Montoya) were an added delight, as was the initial confrontation between Capt. Bilibad (John Lee) and Capt. Peleg (Harold Hopkins), and Queequeg.Norman Golden II as Pip was even more delightful, and I was at a loss to express my joy at Ted Levine as Starbuck, Hugh Keays-Byrne as Mr. Stubb and Shane Feeney Connor as Mr. Flask. The big show-stopper was a cameo by Gregory Peck as Father Mapple, and BOY - did his sermon give me goose pimples the way Peck performed it. Made the original Orson Welles performance seem amateurish!The usually hilarious Aussie-man Bruce Spence (ROAD WARRIOR and MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME) gives a suitably creepy, ethereal performance as \"the prophet\" Elijah. His work also dwarfs the turn Royal Dano gave in Peck's film.All I can say is this tv classic deserves a space on your shelf next to the earlier films. Only trouble is you won't get Barrymore's 1930 version at all.",

    "review/text": "My American Lit class had reached Civil War era literature toward the end of the semester. While I wanted to give them a taste of Melville's classic novel, there was no way they would be able to read a 600 page book in time for the final; so I decided to show the DVD instead. I originally wanted to show the Gregory Peck version, but our school's Media Center only had Patrick Stewart version. I had asked a fellow colleague about showing this DVD, and she said she had a positive experience with it when she showed it to her students the previous year.Well, while I can't say it was a horrible experience (Students were, by and large, attentive to the movie), it wasn't particularly well done. The acting was uneven: Queequeg and Father Mapple (played by Peck in a cameo role) were very good, but the other characters weren't overly convincing. The most surprising part of the DVD, however, was how poor the special effects were. Given today's technology, I had expected more than a fake-looking tail and the same rubber hump coming out of the water over and over again. Even the kids found these \"effects\" laughable.The opening scenes of the DVD were actually quite good. The kids found it humorous when Ishmael suddenly finds out that he is to share his room (and his bed) with the menacing looking Queequeg. This part of the DVD compares favorably with the Peck version, but it's all downhill from there.The bulk of the blame rests on Patrick Stewart's portrayal of Ahab. Other reviewers have lambasted his performance, and while I can't say it was terrible, he doesn't have the charismatic malevolence to pull it off. The Audience wonders how someone so unconvincing can suck the Pequod's crew down into his own madness; therefore, the acting becomes artificial and the Audience, rather than imagining being part of the story, remains a distant observer. Starbuck, too, seemed more confrontational than I remember when I read \"Moby Dick\" in college. Secondary characters (Flask, Tashtengo, Dagoo) were almost non-existant; by that, I mean if you hadn't read the book, you wouldn't know who they were in the DVD. There were also certain scenes I didn't care too much for (Trapped in the Artic ice; Storm with St. Elmo's fire), but overall, a decent movie.Definitely, a VERY difficult book to adapt. Director did keep as much action as possible, so my students weren't bored with the movie, but if I had to do it all over again, I much prefer the Gregory Peck version (which I recently viewed). Your money is better served buying THAT version rather than this one.",

I've read the book many times, and I viewed Ahab as a man with an obsession, not a man who is a street lunatic who just happens to command a whaling ship (when he is not being abducted by aliens.)Sorry to have to slam Stewart, who I love as an actor. He did indicate in press interviews that he was very insecure about playing Captain Ahab. I guess it shows. I can however, wholeheartedly compliment the Maori actor Piripi Waretini who plays Queequeg (my favorite character in the book) and Ted Levine was very fine as Starbuck.

After watching both of them carefully, I decided that this newer offering would have much more appeal to my students than the older film.I seem to have been right, and I think it is safe to say that the 1950's film can now be retired, except for film buffs and the curious.I especially liked the fact that the American Indian and South Sea Island characters in this film were actually played by people who appear to be part of those societies. In the 1950's film, they are played by what looks to be white factory workers from upstate New York wearing lots of makeup. This would have been very annoying and distracting to my diverse group of students.As for other reviewers' comments about Patrick Stewart's performance, my feeling is that he nailed it. As Starbuck says, \"to seek revenge against a dumb brute that only bit thee out of blindest instinct is blasphemy...\" Ahab is someone who sees the idea of resigning oneself to a negative twist of fate as repellant. He is someone who would rather burn to a crisp than ask a higher power for rain. The thing that drives him isn't just obsession; it is rebellion against the infinite.In psychological terms, Ahab gave all of his power to the whale, and enslaved his life and destiny to it when it was not rationally necessary for him to do so. He is like a small child who has had his lollipop taken away, and who has thrown himself on the floor, absolutely determined to be inconsolable by anything or anyone. Stewart captures that aspect of Ahab perfectly, and it led to some very constructive paper writing and classroom discussion.I only withhold the fifth star because I wish this film was a longer \"Director's Cut\" version, covering more of the book than it currently does.",

    "review/text": "Gee, it started out so well; this version of Herman Mehlville's classic novel of obsession and revenge begins with an earnestness that suggests it might actually do justice to it's literary inspiration. But unfortunately, that is not to be the case. The inherent problem with bringing Moby Dick to the screen is that the book is such a massive work that combines sea-going adventure and complex characters with an almost textbook discussion of whales and their habits. Whether you've read the book or not, you are probably aware of the story. A young wanderer signs on to a whaling expedition under the command of a legendary captain seeking to avenge his maiming by a a white whale. John Huston made a semi-classic version in 1956 that succeeded far better than this despite one of the few so so performances by Gregory Peck.The problem with this particular production is that it suffers from a bad case of \"mini-series syndrome\" -- a headline actor, plenty of time to tell the story and a limited budget to work with. Patrick Stewart certainly does his part. As Captain Ahab he displays a range of psychotic emotion that somehow eluded Gregory Peck in the '56 version (one of Peck's few disappointing performances). Ahab is a difficult character to portray without going over the top, but Stewart succeeds, quickly banishing the viewer's expectations to hear him refer to the First Mate Starbuck as \"Number One\" or issuing an order to \"make it so\" ala his alter ego Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Stewart's Ahab is as scared psychologicaly as he is physically. But in Stewart's hands you can somewhat understand the sailing and leadership ability of Ahab while bemoaning the course of destruction that he is pursuing.Another actor that stands out is Piripi Waretini in the role of Queequeg. His portrayal is far more enigmatic than the almost cartoonish \"savage\" portrayed in the earlier movie. But from there the quality of performance by the remaining cast drops precipitously. Henry Thomas is okay as Ishmael, however Ted Levine as the ill-fated Starbuck seems to be acting with his jaw wired shut. Mr. Peck is wasted in the almost cameo role of Father Mapple.Ironically, the seagoing visuals of the older film are far superior to those of this more digitized version. While the whale is more believable, the shipboard storm scenes look like they were filmed at a movie studio theme park, and sadly, they get worse as the film progresses. Was there a problem with the budget?Watch it if you will, there are far worse things to put in your DVD player. And if it stirs your interest sufficently enough to read the book... that is a very good thing!",

    "review/text": "I was really disappointed with the movie. I read the book which had its boring parts, but it also had its exciting parts. I felt that the movie just dragged along very slowly. Most of the visuals of the whales are nothing more than a tail or fin. There are some computer generated whales that are shown, but they are far and few between. In one of the final seens where Moby Dick attacks the rest of the crew, you see one of the most ridiculous part of the movie. Moby Dick's tail slams down on each of the boats a few times and you are left to assume that all the crews are dead. It was very repetitive for that scene. I also thought that the movie made Starbuck appear as though he was going mad too, where as, he seemed a little more cool, calm, and collected in the book. Flask was way over acted as well. I think the portrayal of Stubb and Ishmael was very good though. I don't know, you probably can't make this book into a good movie without changing the script a little bit and \"Hollywoodizing\" it. But honestly the book on tape version would probably be more entertaining than this movie.",

Although, truth be told, Cameron probably would have quintupled the budget with his salary alone. The world deserves a modern big screen treatment of this classic tale. Too bad this is what we got.There is nothing wrong with the acting. Henry Thomas (yes, E.T.'s Henry Thomas) gives a noble performance as Ishmael. Gregory Peck makes a more than worthwhile cameo as the fire and brimstone-spouting Father Mapple. But once the Pequod sets sail, it's time to look for a lifeboat.For a film that obviously spent a lot of time and money shooting in worldwide locales with first-rate actors on a gorgeous - if not overly decorated - period ship, somebody severely dropped the ball in the post-production department. Dropped the ball, stuck a harpoon in it and then dumped it overboard.Underwater shots are laughable, computerized sperm whales breach like marlins and the only real special effects prop used (a high school-project whale tail) is about as convincing as a cardboard light-sabre.The film is hacked together for television commercial inserts and has all the artistic pacing of a spooked horse. The anticlimactic ending turns Ahab's most powerful speech (\"From Hell's heart, I stab at thee...\") into an uncomfortable afterthought. And the seventeen dollars that appeared to be left for the special effects make for the most cringe-worthy ship sinking ever put to film.Call me Ishmael. Call me whatever you want.

I found the English subtitles (for those of us who need help hearing) contain an unacceptable number of errors - from simple misspellings (e.g., \"thoudsands\" for \"thousands\") to text that appears to be the transcribed notes of a non-native English speaker (as heard by his/her ear and written out by sound). I highly recommend that Amazon contract with an editor to review the English subtitles, edit appropriately, and that Amazon find a way to insert corrected text. The errors are so distracting that I would even ask Amazon to send corrected versions to those who request a swap-out (such as myself).",

    "review/text": "Who could every truly do justice to Melville's masterpiece? Moby Dick is a novel that resists adaptation. In order to rein it in, one must make sacrifices. Franc Roddam's for-TV version is arguably the best attempt to present its source material in a digestible way while still preserving the author's intent.Again, there is always something lost in adaptation, but there is enough here to examine some important themes. In fact, I teach high-school American literature, and I use this adaptation as a basis to examine themes of God, life and destructive obsession as well as characteristics of Dark Romanticism. My teenage students are for the most part not prepared to tackle the complexity of the novel, but this adaptation is quite manageable, and it is nice that they typically find it enjoyable as well.This mini-series was produced for TV in Australia in 1997, and at times it does show its age. Some of the whaling scenes in particular are not very convincing, and the background scenery at times looks fake. Still, the effects are quite advanced for 1997, especially for TV, and it doesn't look too bad today.The Emmy Award-winning soundtrack by Christopher Gordon is outstanding. It is epic and Wagnerian without becoming tired and repetitive. Incidentally, the soundtrack alone makes for enjoyable listening, even apart from the context of the film.Gregory Peck won a Golden Globe Award for his cameo appearance as Father Mapple. This was his last role, and I am sorry to say that here is where I part ways with most reviewers. Peck's Father Mapple is too warm, too approachable to do justice to the role. This is a poignant moment in the novel, introducing the theme of a disinterested God. A touch more of the fire and brimstone might have helped, but an iciness like the coldness of the sea would have been even better. Besides, Gregory Peck was a fine actor, but he does not even seem to be trying here. He could have been reading the part for the first time. Again, I understand this is not the general consensus, and I welcome any comments to the contrary.As for the other actors, there are certainly some, well, flawed performances. In the interest of accentuating the positive, I will not dwell on these flaws. Suffice to say that by the end of the film, there are certain members of the crew who I was happy to see go down to Davy Jones' locker.On the other hand, Henry Thomas makes a convincing Ishmael and Ted Levine shines as Starbuck, giving the second-best performance in the film. Needless to say, Patrick Stewart is perfectly cast as Ahab; his background in Shakespeare coupled with his experience on the small screen lend to his success in this role. He delivers the Shakespearean monologues sans melodrama, and his effort binds and sustains this film.It is easy to nitpick any adaptation of Moby Dick. The 1956 adaptation was too short and featured a too-young Gregory Peck as Ahab. This adaptation has been criticized for being a long, incohesive mess. It is important to remember that upon its first printing, the novel itself was heavily panned. At the end of the day, there is no perfect adaptation of Moby Dick, and there will never be a perfect adaptation of Moby Dick, but if you look here, you will find an exceptional soundtrack, a fair attempt to tackle important themes in the novel and some fine performances. For what it's worth, I can appreciate that.",

Half of the movie is on a ship in the water. You think he'd miss the chance for some rays?4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? JCVD goes for a little anonymous redhead in this one.5. Is there a tournament? Perhaps if a race is sport, and all tournaments are sport, maybe it's a tournament. Otherwise it's just the Americans versus the Russians6. Is training needed for this tournament? Only acting training7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? This may be the only movie in which a character not only does the splits while wearing a suit and a tie, but he also does it in khakis.8. Does he punch someone in the balls? To be honest, I can't say I remember it happening. However, given the fact that I dozed off during several scenes, it's entirely possibly that JCVD performed a fistectomy.9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? In every single fight.10. Is his enemy unbeatable? Hardly. He's just a little Asian guy with big hair and a black belt.11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Aside from being a Belgian, acting as a Russian, and speaking in broken English...not really.12. Does he win? It doesn't matter - the viewer loses.Some planes go down over the Mediterranean, and three were carrying top secret laser guidance systems. The rest is a race to get them before the Russians. Somehow, a Japanese guy codenamed \"Black Eagle\" goes in for the United States and a Belgian guy goes in for the Russians. And that's probably the movie's biggest problem; it's nearly incomprehensible the majority of the time because of various language barriers that aren't overcome.A fan of JCVD, action, or good movies will be severely disappointed. He's barely in the movie, and the rest is just bad. When you begin to crave the acting talents of JCVD, then you know the rest of the movie is slop.

The plot is a nonsense actioner between Kosugi as a CIA op and JCVD as his KGB counterpart. What is of interest is Van Damme's interpreation of a Red bad guy. This was not his first appearance as a Russian fighter. In NO RETREAT NO SURRENDER he was Ivan, a Russian mafia enforcer. Here he is Andrei, a KGB operative who is battling Kosugi for a secret weapon. When Van Damme plays the heavy, he is somehow more threatening, more lethal than when he is the punching bag good guy. One of his best moments in this or any of his other actioners occurs when he is not fighting at all. He is seen as merely talking to his wife who is genuinely concerned for his safety. Their verbal interaction marks him as distinctly human as they ponder his looming fate. Further his aggressive fight scenes with Kosugi are first rate. Van Damme's untimely demise with a ship's propeller raises some unexpected sighs of sympathy. BLACK EAGLE is a watchable early slice of a very young JCVD as he proves that given the right script, he can deliver acting on cue with the same verve as one of his patented roundhouse kicks.",

    "review/text": "From the end of the Cold War comes a movie that was probably written at the height of the Cold War, went through several years of production and finally came out right at the end of the Cold War and this probably killed any chance it had at success. I mean, who wants to watch a movie about Russians spies fighting US spies when you can get down with that sexy East German girl in your chem class while listening to the Scorpions' song \"Winds of Change\" or that cool Jesus Jones ditty, \"Right Here, Right Now\"? As a result, this enjoyable action movie is a hidden gem that few people remember. On to the plot...SHO KOSUGI, Star of tons of Japanese Ninja films, plays a CIA spy who is called into action when a secret US plane, an F-111, goes down in the waters off Malta. This sequence is probably the cheapest of the entire movie as we only get to LISTEN to the plane going down instead of WATCHING the plane crash. Guess they had to spend that extra money on Jean-Claude's body wax. Speaking of JC, Mr. Van Damme plays the Russian martial arts expert/ body guard who is brought in by the KGB to try to steal the top-secret warhead off the F-111 before the CIA can get it. The only catch is, first they both have to find where in the ocean the plane crashed...Along the way, Sho kills multiple Maltese citizens and various KGB agents all while Jean-Claude romances a young lady on the KGB's tugboat. In fact, all of the killing makes JC's character a lot more sympathetic than Sho's, which I'm sure the producers did not intend. Anyway, lots of action and things blowing up later there is the final showdown with Sho and JC which...well, you'll have to watch the movie to see what happens. Take my word, though, it's a great fight scene.As the movie progresses, the viewers are treated to scene after scene of the gorgeous Maltese countryside: churches, forts and of course lots of the beautiful blue Mediterranean. Malta is the real star of this movie. However, almost all of the actors are attempting to speak English as a second language and as a result of the conflagration of Japanese, Belgian, Maltese and fake Russian accents, entire sections of the movie are almost unintelligible. I challenge even someone with a digital comb-filter, mondo-sound TV to understand what the heck Sho and JC are saying to each other in the final fight scene. But, since I'm here trying to defend this film, let's just call that a \"minor production glitch.\"All-in-all this is a good action movie that can be bought for a cheap price. Sounds like a great combo to me. Since this is an international production, watch out for bootlegs that are floating around. Also, don't buy the SLP tapes churned out by \"GoodTimes\" movies back in the 90's. Awful quality.Those of you who read my other review of a Malta-filmed movie, \"Final Justice,\" be on watch for a couple of actors and locations featured in that movie. The evil bar-owner has a big role in this movie as does the heroic cab-driver. Where the heck is Hellena Abella? Ah, well, only Malta knows and Malta ain't telling...",

    "review/text": "Now don't take this into the wrong direction. I like Van Damme as well as Sho Kosugi, but even they couldn't save this film from being so boring and so abysmal. I was so bored by this film, that not only did I fall asleep during the film, I couldn't even finish the thing.An F-11 holding a device that the United States government cannot afford to lose crash lands in the Mediterranean. The KGB lead by Andrei (Played by Van Damme), unfortunately, are much closer to finding the device than the CIA. The United States government decides to send in their best man, Ken Tani, The Black Eagle (Played by Kosugi). Tani decides to head to Malta with his two kids (Played by Kosugi's own children) to find the device before the KGB does.I have nothing else to say about this crap except that even if you're a Van Damme superfan, don't bother, and just leave it in the $3 bin at BigLots! I'm actually quite surprised Van Damme's career wasn't ruined by this travesty. Then again, he was just getting started.Not Recommended.DVD Extras: An okay full frame presentation (Take pride in the fact that I said that, by the way) along with the movie's trailer and production notes that no one really cares about, much like the movie itself. Also, the back of the DVD says that there's a Making-of featurette included, but there's no such thing on the DVD, but for a \"film\" like this, it's no big loss.",

This guy plays the main character of this crummy movie, &quot;Black Eagle,&quot; where he goes up against Jean-Claude Van Damme while defending America against the Soviets in a plot so ludicrous that the people confused by &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; would gnaw off a limb from utter boredom and confusion. Now, Van Damme's not a great actor. He's decent in most of his films, but he's not great. Heck, I wouldn't even call him good. However in this film he does a terrific job for a few reasons. A) He has about three lines, B) He only needs one facial expression through the whole film, and C) No one else in this film can act!!! What we get are blank stares, monotone deliveries, and very uninteresting dialogue. Now the action scenes: they stink too. There are a gazillion chases in this movie, all of them uninteresting (I fell asleep during a car chase, woke up and it was still going on), the much-hyped one-on-one fighting between Van Damme and this Kosugi guy is great at first, but the final battle loses the edge and just can't seem to get very innovative. &quot;Black Eagle&quot; may have been a good choice for Van Damme so early in his career. Now if they would've made an entirely different movie, perhaps there would've been something there to enjoy.",

    "review/text": "If you are a Van Damme fan, beware! He is barely even in the movie so don't let the DVD box cover fool you. Actually, he isn't even the star of the movie!! I'm not sure what advice he was given post Bloodsport from his agent, but when you go from being the main star in a very good martial arts movie to having a very tiny role in a very bad movie, I think that would raise some questions as to his choices in roles. Likewise, he is playing the stereotypical \"bad Russian\"--much like he did in his brief cameo in No Retreat, No Surrender. With the exception of 3-4 fight scenes and a romance scene, Van Damme is no where to be seen. Trust me though, this DVD is cheap enough (or can be found cheap enough) to warrant buying just for those fight scenes (for the true Van Damme fan).Plot - DTypical '80's plot with a downed jet fighter with a top secret device onboard that the Russians want and the CIA wants to get back. The CIA sends Asian martial artist Sho Kosagi after it and the Russians send Van Damme after it. The two have several confrontations, most ending in a draw. The martial arts choreography is very good and Van Damme performs his trademark splits and jumping spin kicks. There is a slight side story about Kosagi's kids and a female agent, but it isn't very detailed and not all that interesting. Again, the main reason for renting or buying the movie is for the fights between Van Damme and Kosagi.Acting - DTerrible acting from everyone. There really isn't any redemption for this category. The wooden acting of Van Damme playing a Russian is fine and expected, but the lifeless acting of the rest of the cast is just aweful.Music/Soundtrack - DI assume there was a soundtrack and some music, but it was so forgettable that nothing stands out.Cinematography - CVery nice location shooting in Malta (or a location doubling as Malta). Other than that, the camera angles are all standard and nothing to set it apart or make it very memorable.DVD - FSome DVD's claim to have the making of featurette. BEWARE - I have never seen it or found it on a DVD of this film. The extras are standard with an original trailer and some back story bios. The quality of the image transfer is subpar and is full screen only.Overall - DPerhaps Van Damme's worst movie of all time. Only for the true die-hard Van Damme fan and one who will pay $5 for 5 minutes of fight scenes.",

It begins with stretching and warm ups then progresses to standing meditation and finally to stationary and walking taiji qigong sets. Everything is demonstrated by Dr. Yang with very good form from two angles. The narration is clear and offers helpful descriptions and tips on what is being demonstrated. There is also a graphic denoting when to inhale/exhale during the technique. The techniques that make up the qigong sets are shown individually for learning and then the set is shown in its entirety. This DVD also covers the internal connections/structure needed to lead qi or express power. This progression of skills, with practice, will improve and develop the viewers ability to increase mobility and relaxation, regulate the mind and breathing, and sense/lead qi. In summary, I think this DVD offers very comprehensive coverage of taiji qigong and I recommend it for all tajiquan practitioners and also people who are after the numerous health benefits of qigong (such as increased immunity, mobility, stress release, whole body strengthening and coordination, etc.).",

It will increase your flexibility, balance, and believe it or not, your strength. An intimate knowledge of qigong will improve your form greatly. From a martial perspective consider the value of body awareness, which will improve by leaps and bounds through constant practice of qigong and form.For someone with an interest in increasing their knowledge of qigong and tai chi chuan you might also want to view Dr. Yang's Understanding QiGong series and works by Ramel Rones.",

    "review/text": "This DVD has the following sections that cover the different aspects of Taiji Qigong:The purposes of Taiji QigongTraining ProceduresImportant PointsStretchingWarming upWai Dan Standing Still MeditationMoving TaijiquanPURPOSES OF TAIJI QIGONGThis course follows the same general approach as Dr. Yang's book \"Taijiquan Theory\", which teaches that a student should regulate in the following order:Regulate the bodyRegulate the breathRegulate the mindRegulate the chiRegulate the spiritExplanations are given as the material is presented. The stated goal of Taiji Qigong is to lead the student into the domain of emptiness, represented by the concept Wuji. At this point Body Qi and Mind Qi become one and all desires disappear. Fortunately, for the many of us that might not reach this accomplished a level, the journey trying to get there is still wonderful and filled with many body, mind and spirit health benefits.TRAINING PROCEDUREThis section talks about regulating the body by being relaxed, centered, balanced and rooted. When we line up our bodies properly with the earth/ground, it becomes much easier to begin to relax our bodies and mind since we are no longer fighting the effects of being out of balance. This causes our Qi to circulate and avoid stagnation.Once we learn to regulate the breath, then the mind can lead the Qi effortlessly, as explained by Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming. Each of the five regulations are covered using explanations and demonstrations by Dr. Yang.WARMING UPThis is a very thorough presentation of well thought out exercises that assist a student/practitioner in loosening their body, muscles and joints. The exercises in this section teach how to connect the parts and move as one unit. Some of the exercises massage and move the internal organs in a beneficial way.The goals of the abdominal exercises on the DVD are:Regain control of the muscles in the abdomenLoosen the lower dan tian so Qi can flowImprove and smooth the Qi circulation in the small and large intestinesImprove and smooth the Qi circulation in the kidneysloosen the kidney areaEliminate Qi stagnation in lower backLoosen muscles, stomach, gallbladder, liver & spleenImprove Qi circulation in these areasUse the mind to lead the Qi from the lower dantien to the solar plexus areaDr. Yang then teaches chest exercises, arm exercises, loosening up the torso and the internal organs, loosening the wrists, coiling forward and backward, settling the wrists, rotating the ball, and pushing to the sides. For each of these sections, an explanation is given of what the goals should be for each exercise. Dr. Yang is shown split screen with different views of him demonstrating the exercises.A sign of quality material is when the \"warm up\" or \"basic\" exercises are so well designed that they truly have all the secrets of the art, and alone would still be worth the cost of the video. If someone practiced only these warm up exercises, they would still be of great value. As a beginning student, I recall wanting to skip the warm up exercises and go straight to the Taijiquan form.My teacher taught many Taiji exercises using a Taiji staff that measured from the ground to the armpit. This staff work, I realized many years later, to be of great value and well worth the extra effort of making them a part of the daily Taijiquan practice, along with the form, push hands, etc... The wise student will enjoy spending time learning these exercises. So don't skip these exercises when you watch this video. Spend a lot of time in this section to truly develop a strong foundation in this Taiji Qigong ability.IMPORTANT POINTSThis section delves into the theory and concepts of Taiji Qigong, with the goal being to return your spirit to its origin, nature. Advice is given on diet, life style and the best time of day to practice.STRETCHINGThis section teaches three or four different types of stretches, while encouraging one to stretch slowly, gently, no tensing of the muscles, no holding your breath, but rather to breath naturally. Dr. Yang recommends ten repetitions of each of the demonstrated stretching techniques.WAI DAN STANDING STILL MEDITATIONDr. Yang demonstrates this Wai Dan version, but for the Nei Dan version of standing still meditation, the practitioner is referred to the book \"The essence of Taiji Qigong\", the companion book for this video. Tips are given for the correct practice while showing Dr. Yang demonstrating the form. This form uses the following postures:Embracing the moon on the chest (arcing the arms)Holding up the HeavensSTATIONARY TAIJI QIGONGStand still to regulate the breathing (martial artists use reverse abdominal breathing)Big python softens its bodyThe Qi is sunk to the dan tianExpand the chest to clean the bodyPour the Qi into the Baihui (top of the head)Left and right to push the mountainsSettle the wrists to push the palmsLarge bear swimming in the waterLeft and right to open the mountainEagle attacks its preyLion rotates the ballWhite Crane spreads its wingsAt this point Dr. Yang demonstrates the complete set in continuous movements, repeating each of the forms six times, which would be less than normal.STATIONARY TAIJI QIGONG COILING SETThis sets purpose is to lead Qi to the surface of the skin and the bone marrow through the use of coiling motions, as taught on this DVD. Reverse breathing is recommended for this set due to its benefits of strengthening the guardian Qi and the skin listening Qi. These two types of Qi are used in the martial arts. The postures are:Stand calmly to regulate the spirit and breathingWhite Crane relaxes its wingsDrill forward and pull backLeft and right Yin and YangWater and Fire mutually interactLarge Bear encircles the moonLiving Buddha holds up the heavensTurn Heaven and Earth in front of your bodyGolden Rooster twists its wingsTurn your head to look at the moonBig Python turns its bodyUp and Down coilingsAt this point Dr. Yang demonstrates the complete set in continuous movements, repeating each of the forms six times, which would be less than normal.All of these movements come from the Taijiquan form and should be familiar to anyone who practices Taijiquan. They are excellent for the practitioner when performed with the concentration and focus as demonstrated by Dr. Yang.STATIONARY TAIJI QIGONG ROCKING SETThese exercises helps one to link all the parts, to realize the opposites and how they work together.Embracing armsWard offRoll back and pressPushRotating the ballWALKING TAIJI QIGONGThis involves practicing one movement while stepping continuously, as when you do Cloud Hands and do ten to twenty repetitions without changing to other postures. The set is as follows:Wave hands in cloudsDiagonal flyingTwist body and circle fistsStepping legBrush knee and step forwardRepulse monkeySnake steps downI was pleasantly surprised when I saw some of the exercises on this DVD, as I had developed some of the same exercises, like the walking Taiji Qigong series, as a great way to learn and become comfortable with movements in the form. I frequently have advised students to take a movement and turn it into a mini set. I would usually pick whatever posture was giving me a hard time, and I would create a left and right, continuous way of doing the posture, which would enable me to begin to understand and learn the movements.These exercises are very beneficial for being able to do the movements both on the left and the right, as well as learning how to make the movement circular, in that it can return to its beginning and begin anew.Well, the title sure sounds simple enough. But in reality this is one loaded DVD, with enough material to keep a student busy for a long time. It's nice to be able to have your Qigong set come out of the Taijiquan movements, as they then become more of a complete, whole system.Enjoy!!!!!",

    "review/text": "Qigong, or \"energy work\" is an ancient method of longevity exercises designed to maximize the generation and flow of inner energy (\"chi\" or \"qi\") in ones body.There are literally hundreds of systems, schools and methods of qigong, but Tai Chi Chuan (Supreme Ultimate Boxing) is probably the most easily recognized (if not fully understood) of these.This DVD from Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming incorporates many movements from Tai Chi Chuan, as well as various \"stand-alone\" qigong exercises, linking them into several exercise programs. Each program is designed with a different result in mind (relaxation, stengthening organs, martial power, etc).Broken up into short, easily understandable sections, the session flows smoothly from a brief overview, to warm-ups, stretching, then proceeds to specific energy exercises by body part and/or chi channel.The quality of instruction is superb, as each section opens with a stated goal, then leads the viewer through the sequences (with both a front and side view, shown simultaneously).\"Essence of Taiji Qigong\" is one of those truly rare videos that enables a dedicated person to actually learn physical movement by watching and practicing along with the instructor.This is an excellent example of what a \"workout\" video can (and should) be.",

Instead, I will tell you what I like about the format of this material. First, the narrator has a very strong, yet soft voice. Clear to understand his instructions and explanations. Second, the music track is relaxing and not grating like some other dvd's. Sets the mood for a great practice session. Third, this is a split screen so that you can see the movements for the front and side. Fourth, there is a prompt for inhale and exhale for those who want to follow the pace set by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming. Fifth, there are goals that are described for each movement, so you know what it is that you are working on. Last, but certainly not least, the Qigong sets, as done by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming are powerful, yet easy to follow.There is a bonus in the DVD case. Look under the liner ads and you will find a wonderful chart showing the Seven Pairs of Corresponding Qi Gates.If you value your health, get this DVD and the matching book and begin your practice. Wishing you strong, peaceful chi!",

    "review/text": "\"The Essence of Taiji Qigong: The Internal Foundation Of Taijiquan\" with Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is a complimentary DVD to accompany the book of the same title. The book goes into more depth regarding the theory, while the DVD provides video instruction to assist with learning the movements.The first four minutes of the program show Dr. Yang performing a series of movements while a narrator briefly tells the purpose behind Taiji Qigong.Next, come the Qigong Training Procedures: Regulating the body, regulating the breathing, regulating the mind, regulating the Qi, and regulating the spirit. The narrator gives brief descriptions of what you are doing while Dr. Yang performs movements on screen. Not, the descriptions are not regarding the movements Dr. Yang is performing, but the general goals of the procedures. The narrator then lists a couple important points about practice.We are now about seven minutes into the DVD and we get to the Stretching section. First, the goals of stretching are shared. Dr. Yang performs a series of stretches while music plays. This goes right into the warming up section that follows the same format. The narrator shares the goals as Dr. Yang performs the movements for various parts of the body.Around the 29 minute mark, Dr. Yang shows the Wai Dan Standing Still Meditation. Then at 32 minutes we see the moving taiji qigong. First, there are three sets of Stationary Taiji Qigong: Primary, Coiling, and Rocking Sets. The movements of the sets are taught, and then illustrated continuously. At the 92 minute mark, Walking Taiji Qigong is discussed and demonstrated. The picture is clear, Dr. Yang moves gracefully as always, and the narrator's voice is easy to understand, as are the subtitles. The DVD also contains the standard YMAA extras.Over all, I would highly recommend this DVD and the companion book to anyone interested in learning more about Taiji Qigong. I think these two resources would help the Taiji practitioner with understanding and training. So, why only 4 stars? Because I much prefer the DVDs where Dr. Yang actually teaches to the camera. Those DVDs are like you are there learning from him. This DVD just shows him going through the motions as you listen to the narrator. Also, to get the maximum benefit from this DVD, you must use it in conjunction with the book of the same title. I'm glad to have this DVD in my library, and I'll practice some of the movements from it. However, it is not my favorite Qigong resource by Dr. Yang. Add it to your library, but be sure to get his other DVDs to deepen your understanding too.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of the Lock On Joint Locking Essentials series.",

Once again Dr. Yang provides us with a very interesting and informative DVD regarding these martial arts. This complements his book of the same title and demonstrates the movements in an easy to follow manner. More than that, he explains the purpose, the training and the importance of proper technique and forms.Dr. Yang does indeed explain the \"Essence\" of these art forms which helps the student understand the fundementals and reasons behind the movements and lifestyle. He explains how these movements help regulate the body both internally and externally. Breathing techniques, regulation of body and mind and the history of the art form are fully and interestingly expounded upon.While the title may be interpreted as being for beginners, advanced and intermediate students will also learn a great deal from this DVD. It is an excellent discourse of the basics of Taiji Qigong and anyone with a interest will be rewarded and receive a better education regarding this beautiful style of martial art. Personally, I fully enjoyed learning the reasons why I train, meditate and try to live according to the principles which Dr. Yang explains in his usual interesting style.This DVD is another \"must\" for the serious student.",

I also liked that you had flashed across the TV screen breath and exhale to show where in the technique this is best done.

    "review/text": "For quite a while I had been trying to develop (or find) a comprehensive routine that incorporated stretching, warm-ups and qigong exercise to develop and improve my qi energy for taiji practice, health and vitality. YMAA's \"The Essence of Taiji Qigong\" DVD is exactly what I had in mind.This comprehensive qigong program - designed for beginners as well as intermediate and advanced practitioners - is a complete system for building and developing qi energy within one's body as an internal foundation for taijiquan. The program is also designed to train practitioners to properly use breath, body and mind (yi) to cultivate strong qi for strength, vitality, relaxation and concentration - with the ultimate goal of leading the practitioner into the domain of spiritual cultivation (the \"no extremity\" state or \"wuji\").The DVD program is designed to be used in conjunction with the YMAA companion book of the same name. The DVD demonstrates proper execution of the stretching, warm-up movements and qigong sets - while the book focuses on the theory governing the movements. That said, the DVD contains enough theory, explanation and commentary that it can stand alone as a complete qigong program.Along with stretching and warm-ups, the program introduces and demonstrates Wai Dan Standing Still Meditation, Stationary Taiji Qigong (Primary, Coiling, and Rocking Sets), and Walking Taiji Qigong. The individual movements - most of which are very easy to perform - are demonstrated by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming with both front and side views and shouldn't pose difficulty for beginners. The more complex movements are extracted from the traditional Yang style taijiquan form and will be familiar to taiji practitioners.Personally I'm very grateful to Dr. Yang and his staff at YMAA for producing a DVD program of such physical, mental and spiritual benefit. I highly recommend this 5 star qigong program to anyone interested in improving health, strength, vitality - and their taiji - through the practice of qigong.",

    "review/text": "This is the knowledge most people, I think, are searching for when they begin to investigate Tai Chi. They hear about Qi/Ki/Chi and how Tai Chi can be used to develop and channel these energies. Yet, the neophyte lacks the necessary proficiency to actually sense these energies at their source. If you can't pin point the starting place of these energies... how can you ever hope to properly channel them?Qui Gong is the practice of locating Qi and refining your ability to recognize and proficiently access this force. If you are new to the practice of Tai Chi you may be better served by starting here.I, personally, discovered Qi Gong in the late `90's while suffering a severe back injury. The style came from Korea and was not as flowery as that taught by Dr. Yang. But the healing energy was very effective in aiding my recovery.Dr. Yang is an excellent instructor and I am one of his fans. In this DVD there is only demonstration from him without his verbal insight. That is left to the narrator. This is the only deficiency in what is still a great learning tool. ---It's just that; if you've ever heard Dr. Yang give a lesson or a talk on a particular topic... you kinda hope you will get that very same benefit on his next DVD. His insight and ability to convey knowledge to a student is the gold standard in internal arts training.",

However, I was pleasantly surprised because it spoke clearly so even a novice, like myself, could understand and partake in the activities.The DVD is listed at the highest skill level (third) so the second time viewing it I tried doing several of the exercises; and it didn't take long to get the feel that this was truly an in-depth art form.As an aging 'baby boomer' I am searching for a type of exercise that is easy on my joints, yet effective with results. Qi Gong is the answer and I'm surprised that it (and Tai Chi) are not more popular. For myself, this practice is something I would want to do in private (or with a group that was doing the same thing) since the first series is learning the correct way to breath which, to an on-looker, can appear quite odd. However, Dr. Yang's explanations throughout are very clear and make a lot of sense. The goal being to regulate your body by being relaxed, centered, rooted and balanced.There are five sections to this course and each section is clearly presented. The participant can choose which component is beneficial to them; whether it be a posture towards the left, right or using a circular movement. Each movement is shown at two angles so it's easier to tell if what you're doing is correct.I definitely would recommend this video to all those wanting to learn about the Taijiquan form and I plan to incorporate this into my weekly routine.",

Many viewers will certainly find this movie amusing and lighthearted - and this is a correct mode to describe this one - but it's shallow characters and routine treatment made the final outcome just a passable but unnoticed experience.

Instead her move to Tuscany is filled with frustrating ironies...such as the only worthwhile Italian guy being married...to her mindless jump into the bed of an Italian playboy (and subsequent tears because he has decided to move on)...etc etc etc. So many of the attempts at depth and humor are too superficial or downright cheesy to be believed.

Diane Lane is especially enjoyable in this one, playing a character we all knew she would be a perfect fit for, because let's face it, Diane Lane can do very little wrong.She plays Frances, a newly divorced writer who becomes so miserable in her life living in an apartment complex for divorcees that she decides to take her friend's offer to go on a romantic tour of Tuscany-- a gay romantic tour of Tuscany. Not that this matters at all in the film (because it really doesn't), but this is the reason she decides to leave in the first place because she'll have no chance that anyone will hit on her while she's \"Gay And Away.\"Taking yet another chance, Frances buys an adorable little villa called Bramasole, which is just as picturesque as can be. Soon we get a plethora of interesting characters-- two ethnically mis-matched teens in love, a guy who never talks that can't stop shaking when he's around Frances, a goofy rotund contractor, a crazy blonde actress and more. This all equals a fun movie that no one should miss.Okay, so some cliches are employed here, but just think of how many movies do this. It's hard to create a truly original film without using some of the elements that audiences have come to love in a love story. Cliche is perhaps afterall a much overused word in the movie business. What matters is that a movie is fun to watch with fun characters and a plot that will no doubt make you smile. That's what's truly important.

The characters are one dimensional, the acting is sluggish, the dialogue is banal and contrived, the directing is awful, but worst of all, the script is terrible. The screenplay oozes simplistic simple minded notions of political correctness and insight where there is none. Audrey Wells purports to have written a complex and surprising story with unexpected twists and turns, but what she has produced is a shallow and unsatisfying film with no real purpose other than to make the fairly obvious point that life is full of surprises and unexpected outcomes. Gee - what an insight. The characters are completely unsympathetic and the only thing that makes this film watchable at all is the backdrop of Cortona. This film entirely misses the point of the book and I just hope the author was well paid for allowing her book to be associated with this awful movie.",

    "review/text": "I knew the movie had little to do with the book of the same name, which would have been fine but I could tell that it wasn't just the facts they'd changed for the movie but the whole feel. The book didn't turn Italy and her men into stereotypes of hunky, swarthy men. But the movie managed to do that and more, turning every character we came across into a stereotype. Here's a bus filled with gays laughing and being inclusive and friendly, even to the straight girl. Here's a lesbian couple, blissful in their coming parenthood. Here's the pregnant friend now abandoned by aforementioned gay lover who, in what looks like her 10th month of pregnancy, jumps on a plane to show up unannounced at her buddy's Italian villa to have her baby. And live there, as far as we can tell. Here's the beautiful, eccentric actress from a by-gone day spewing out sexual advice while lunching with a group of nuns -- and dressed a bit like a padre? Why not! She's eccentric, don't you know. Missing was the nuts and bolts of how all this happens. How's Frances Mayes (Lane) supporting herself? Where's the money coming from? In the book, Mayes and her lover spent summer's in Italy working the house and land back to life, then running back to SF to teach so they could make more money to do the whole thing again next summer vacation. And the book has a final scene that left me gasping with surprise and delight which the movie was in no way going to recreate, not with Lane's Mayes sniffing out yet another lover in the movie's last scene. Was that all the movie could aspire to, that Diane Lane find another lover? Talk about shallow.I'm not so rigid to believe that a movie based on even a favorite book must be loyal to that book. But with any changes, you'd expect the movie to be good in its own way. I'm not sure why this movie bothered calling attention to its connection to Mayes' book. Why not just call it \"Chick finds sex in Italy\" and leave it at that?",

    "review/summary": "(3 1/2) A FICTIONAL MOVIE Script Based On A TRUE STORY",
    "review/text": "The concept that formed the basis of Frances Mayes' acclaimed memoir UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN has been used as a starting point for the development of the storyline for this film. However, this movie is a wonderful illustration of the difficulties of fashioning a film with wide box office appeal from a fascinating book with a devoted but limited audience. I have not read the book but apparently its lyrical and captivating descriptions of Frances' experiences in purchasing and renovating Bramasole, a rundown Italian villa, and of her enjoyment of life in the Italian countryside led the producers to want to capture those experiences on film. However, they decided that they needed more of a story in order to engage the audience, and settled on a backdrop of failed romance contrasted with the enthusiasm of young love as a means of keeping the audience engaged for this almost two hour film. The result is an enjoyable story, some wonderful scenery, several funny lines and incidents but no truly uproarious comedy, a marvelous performance by Diane Lane, but also a relatively formulaic story that never veers too far from the predictable. Yet while attempting to provide feelgood endings for all the various threads of the story, it does fail however to answer the mystery regarding the old man with flowers.The movie casts Frances as a frustrated writer whose professional existence is as a book reviewer, and this persona is important to the storyline both at the start and also at the contrived conclusion of the film. She becomes despondent when she learns that her husband is having an affair and wants a divorce, and this film traces her progress through the various stages of her emotional journey. It then utilizes the technique of her deciding to live in and renovate an Italian villa which she stumbles upon during a trip to Italy (arranged by her concerned friends) as the source of her eventual catharsis and reaffirmation of life. Her best friend Patti (Sandra Oh) unexpectedly joins Frances in Italy during Patti's final stages of pregnancy when she is deserted by her lesbian lover, and there are romantic episodes involving Frances which provide counterpoint to the budding romance between a young man who is a member of the Polish crew renovating her new home and the daughter of the neighboring Italian family. Finally, there is Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) an intriguing Englishwoman who settled in Italy years ago following a teenage encounter with FE FE (known to the rest of us as Frederico Fellini) that left an indelible impression on her life.While all this is enjoyable, due to the fact that the plot was grafted onto a very different type of book the movie simply wanders towards its eventual conclusion without any real suspense or passion. While I am sure that many filmgoers will differ, I would have it preferred that it contain either more realism or at the other extreme be a much more straightforward character study with some elements of suspense, unfortunately we got neither. (Personally, I had hoped for an Italian version of THIS OLD TUSCAN HOUSE with a Bob Vila equivalent giving some serious insights into such a project intertwined with a believable storyline.) Instead, the renovation project itself was used mostly to generate laughs. Thus, despite the film being well made and enjoyable, I cannot rate it more than three stars since I have no desire to either watch it again in the immediate future or to own the DVD. However, when you want light entertainment, and especially if you are a Diane Lane fan or want to see a performance by an actress who gets the most out of her material, you should see this film. Just don't set your expectations too high.Tucker Andersen",

Yeah, well,... no.If this movie is on a plane, I would recommend listening to the conversation in the cockpit or thumb wrestling with the toddler who is kicking your chair. Diane Lane is OK, the group that does the renovations provided SOME comic relief (on purpose) but all the rest of the cast should he hanged for their involvement.",

Where the book has barely a plot and nothing of any interest (unless you're a huge HGTV fan), the movie has a slightly more interesting plot by virtue of a protagonist that has just gone through a divorce. Her home has appreciated significantly (which explains better than the book how she has the wealth to buy a Tuscan villa and renovate it). Her friends then sign her onto a gay tour of Tuscany, which could have given the movie some depth ...but evidently was scuttled in favor of more conventional fare. Nothing dooms a film like cowardice.The rest of the movie is about the woman trying to find a new husband while pretending not to. In the end, of course (of course!) she succeeds. This kind of twaddle should embarrass even made-for-TV writers.In the right hands, this revised storyline could have turned into a perfectly decent movie.

    "review/text": "I bought this movie hoping to see some Tuscan scenery and because I like Diane Lane.There are few views of Italy and they are very brief. In fact, the whole movie is a series of glimpses. A birth scene lasting ten seconds. A sketchy sex scene between two people who just met and don't show any signs of connecting. Glimpses of renovating the house. There is no story as such. The idea that she finds herself is totally unconvincing.The relationships are nil, except between the young boy and girl. Frances and her Chinese friend are constantly telling each other how much they like each other and that they are best friends, but we never see any other interaction between them except that. They have a half-dozen scenes at least and this is what they say every time!The reason God created stories was so that relationships could develop and become convincing. By avoiding any continuous development and giving us a choppy, episodic smattering of this and that, this movie fails as travelogue, as love story, as friendship story, as personal development story.Contrast this movie with \"My House in Umbria\" to see what I mean. The people in that movie connect with each other. And they have character. None of these people are characters, except the aging film star. And the scenery is a presence in that movie, and is almost an actor in the movie in its effect on the people.I think the appeal of Under the Tuscan Sun is in its theme: You can do anything you want without forethought, let the chips fall where they may, and it will all work out fine. This message is repeated explicitly several times throughout the film and is indeed illustrated repeatedly by the film itself. You can even do nothing and next thing you know, you'll be crawling with ladybugs (a symbol of good luck). This legitimation of irresponsibility must have enormous appeal for a lot of people.",

And just how does she manage to up and move to Italy without even having to fill in an immigration form? And if she was so broke that she had to move out of her mansion in San Francisco into a run-down fleabag hotel, just how the hell can she afford to suddenly buy and renovate a house in Italy, as well as living there for months with no visible means of income?The worst part of a spectacularly awful script is the love interest suddenly written in at the very last minute to tie everything up neatly - that really is bad writing of such magnitude that it deserves a special Oscar.Still, if you turn the sound off, you can enjoy genuinely beautiful photography of Italy.",

    "review/text": "\"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is a rare commodity in films today- a thoughtful, mature, and elegant romantic comedy which is tastefully written and exquisitely performed. The profusion of obscenities and graphic sexual exploits found in most recent \"comedies\" thankfully are absent in this splendid movie.This movie is rich with gentle humor and accurate insight into the human condition. We have all experienced joy and sadness, loneliness, and the yearning to be loved and accepted by others. The central character, played by Diane Lane, is an intelligent and attractive thirtyish writer who has suffered a heartbreaking divorce. She decides to make a fresh start and relocates from the U.S. to the lush countryside of Tuscan, Italy. She buys a dilapidated villa and plans to have it renovated as her new home.As the villa is transformed by a construction crew of rather eccentric Polish immigrants, Lane's character also undergoes changes. She becomes more of a risk-taker and forces herself out of her comfort zone so she can meet and mingle with the locals while absorbing their language and customs along the way. She learns more about herself in the process.Our heroine's spirits get a major boost when her best friend (drolly represented by Sandra Oh) comes to live with her in the villa. The best friend is pregnant, and she has been deserted by her female lover. Lane's character and Oh's character find strength and comfort from their long friendship. They understand each other even if nothing has been said. They have a special bond.There are so many delights in \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" not the least of which is the bright ensemble of actors with Diane Lane's textured, sympathetic performance especially memorable. She makes you really care about this decent and kind wounded soul who is trying so hard to move on with her life after the trauma of divorce from a seemingly happy marriage.Too many movies today are mindless, exploitative trash. A movie like \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is a reminder that there are a few talented, conscientious artists still around who are able to create movies that are intelligent and have a heart. We should celebrate and encourage these artists. Audiences have been deprived long enough.",

And no sign of the 'evil' ex-husband as the heroine goes about putting her life back together....This is a female fantasy movie, obviously. Its totally escapist in that regard, and that's fine if you like that sort of thing - it was just a little too way-out for my taste.Its saving grace is the wonderful setting in beautiful Tuscany Italy.

With a plot that holds true to real life situations if you are brave enough to take chances, this story is a perfect tale of casting aside your fears and insecurities and taking chances even when you feel like giving up. Frances takes a leap of faith and buys a rustic villa in Tuscany in serious need of a fixing up after a life altering event...a dreaded divorce. After a failed relationship Francis yearns to find love again. She meets a couple different men that help her on the way. As most of us know, you learn from every relationship before finding \"the one.\" While she hopes to find the forever kind of love she keeps busy renovating a house she has many dreams of building a life in. You meet great and somewhat quirky characters, while Francis builds friendships that we all hope for. She grows into woman who is living a life she could only dream about and getting everything she never knew she wanted after many challenges along the way.",

I the starred reviews, and I think that some people like to pick and pick at things. I'm surprised that they have a whole list of complaints about this movie, when it is obvious that noone can expect much out of it anyways. I mean come on, it is very very rare to have a good romantic comedy when the story line is such as it is. I guess the reason why they are top reviewers is because a lot of people agree with them, but, here's one person who likes to escape for one, and not be realistic.

Heck, how are even those of us who've gone through a divorce supposed to relate to this character, who can afford to buy a villa capriciously and fix it up and never worry about money or relatives or other commitments. Aside from those quibbles, the characters are likable but there is no one in this film I would want to spend an evening with, and the situations are hackneyed -- characters who tell her to learn to live again, a snake in the bedroom, irascible characters who thaw toward the end of the film, etc. I strugged to make it through to the end, and itt certainly doesn't make me want to read the book.DVD extras include a commentary track with writer-director Audrey Wells, a 9-minute featurette called &quot;Tuscany 101&quot;, and 3 deleted scenes. The film can be heard in English or French and subtitled in English or Spanish -- what, no Italian?!",

    "review/text": "Diane Lane is a solid actress who has always found herself attached to strangely unsatisfying films. This one suffers from that syndrome as well, or perhaps it actually benefits from it.Most modern \"women's\" pictures are about sex. If a woman is unattached we are to assume she will have her legs wrapped instantly around a man who will moreover be her \"soul mate\" though he or she may need some convincing. The strange thing is you see \"Mr. Darcy\" largely from frame one. Jane Austen would be horrified and amazed how her formula had been distorted.Here we even have \"the best friend\" asking has Lane met \"him\" yet. We are to assume that if you go to Tuscany you are bound to instantly find True Love. But this film does not deliver. I understand many liberties were taken with the book. Wow, they made a book into a movie and they changed it. Do tell.Though it is not a great film, this is the movie that could. I laughed, I actually cried - at first because the countryside is SO beautiful and then because it got to me.Sure there are strange flourishes with the supporting cast that make little sense. The lady who plays the former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Fellini is so odd I thought our heroine had a stroke and was seeing ghosts. But overall it was a delightful experience. To those folks who are jumping all over Ms. Lane because she's \"past her prime\" I say: Keep living, you'll be over 40 someday too. We'll laugh at you then.Part culture lesson, part travelogue, with just the right amount of misdirected romance. And Ms. Lane providing that swirl of chaos, lovely.",

    "review/text": "In a way, I liked this movie a lot more than perhaps I ought. For one thing, I am a guy, and this is very definitely a chick flick (hint for the guys: a great movie to take her on a date). It is also a tad predictable, though it is not without a few surprises. And at times it feels more like a succession of postcards than a film, so perfect does Tuscany look throughout the picture.So why did I enjoy it so much? First, because of the very wonderful performance of Diane Lane as Frances Mayes, the real life author of the book upon which this film is based (and which I must confess I have not read). In my mind, Lane has always been way, way underutilized by Hollywood. She has always shown herself to be an actress of the highest caliber, but for some reason she has not always been granted the kinds of roles that she ought to have received. She is onscreen in this film for very nearly the entire length, and the film is all the better for that. She is also quite beautiful in a seemingly accessible way, and I really loved watching her marvelously expressive face throughout the film.Although the film really does, as I mentioned above, seem sometimes like a succession of postcards or the pictures of a Tuscan calendar, there is no question that the film is surreally beautiful. The town of Cartona looks so exquisite that one is immediately seized with dreams of winning the lottery and moving therewith. It is quite easy to understand why anyone would love to live in such a marvelous place. And the brief scenes in Positano make it look like a perhaps even more beautiful spot than Cartona. There is no question: this is a very gorgeous movie to look at, though perhaps a tad too perfect. One begins to wonder if there were imperfections in the region that the camera chose to ignore. But no matter; this is a fantasy, and the beauty was quite appropriate to the mood of the film.The villa that she purchases more or less becomes one of the major characters in the film. It is lovely thing, a bit dilapidated at the beginning, but by the end of the film it is transformed to something cared for and caring in return. The prospect from the villa is breathtaking, with the gently rolling hills filling most of the view, with mountains in the distant. Her bedroom is definitely a room with a view. This is all played to great advantage in the remarkable scene were a lightening storm seems to ravage the area, with a lightening bolt striking a washing machine in her front yard, and with an owl flying into her bedroom to escape the chaos outside.Finally, I enjoyed the collection of friends--for such they became in the end--in Tuscany. Although Frances goes there as a stranger, by the end of the film she possesses a large and wide-ranging group of friends. One comes to like and know them all, and feel some of the affection for them that Frances feels.This is not one of the great films one is likely to see this year or any other, but it is a warm, likable, beautiful film, and it is hard to imagine many not giving in to its charms.",

However after seeing this movie I felt compelled to write a reveiw.Basically the plot is somewhat predictable and horribly cliche; enough people ran through it already so I do not beleive that it is my duty. However the most predictable parts of this movie are when she goes to the Italian lovers house and finds out that he already has a woman under his roof. (Perhaps she should have rode back with the officer and then made this movie at least interesting).It is from the aformentioned point that the movie goes seriously downhill. The author found it neccessarey to give this movie a happy ending and amazingly one fell from the sky, with the American author appearing out of nowhere and the deadfully cheesy out of class relationship with the Polish kid and the Italian girl.Overall I recommend this movie if you can forgive movie cliches and random happy endings; well all of that and of course bad acting and fourth grade directing.The scenery was however beatiful, but what a waste.",

So many fresh faces (to me, because so many cast members are Italian) so much emotion, fire, passion.I watched the movie and then watched it with the commentary of Audrey Wells, the Writer/Director. She adapted Frances Mayes memoir beautifully - it met with Frances Mayes' approval - not only that, I felt like Wells was an artist wanting to tell a multi-layered, richly textured story.Subtleties, too, such as the lighting changing in the Villa from darker to lighter throughout the film, to one of the supporting characters actually being named Chiara (the very name taken from \"chiarascuoro\" - a painting technique involving moving from the darkness to the light.The deleted scenes were treasures, too - so glad they were on the DVD as well.I adore this film - the scenery delights, the variety of characters and languages.

It's pretty sad when we watch so much reality t.v. that it sucks the imagination out of our closed off minds! And while this movie may not have a direct plot, I think that it teaches a few good lesons. For example, what you wish for may not always come in the form that you want it to (Pawel's wedding, Patti's &quot;family&quot;). And also, just like an earlier review states, it truly is possible to move on after tragedy! Overall, this is just one those movies that gives you a little something to think about afterwards.

I have watched Diane Lane in movies as her career has progressed, and applaud her for jumping in with both feet to portray this beautiful - and after the divorce fragile, and yet ultimately showing a woman's great strength as she regains her confidence and realizes those things she has wished for HAVE come to her, albeit subtly.I've never cared for critics, and would have missed out on many a great film if I had listened to them. Yes, this film is a \"chick-flick\" to those I see that have reviewed it, but..........who cares and why does it matter? If you are looking for a film to watch on a lazy Saturday/Sunday afternoon (after church, of course!) that is beautifully shot, heartfelt, sensitive, romantic and uplifting all rolled into one, Under the Tuscan Sun will surely \"fit the bill\".

What could go wrong?I'm a big Diane Lane fan, and I was really looking forward to watching this one, but it fell flat. It's all about the story and how well it's written. The story line itself had the potential to make a great movie. It just wasn't written very well. Even Diane couldn't rescue the lame dialogue, and usually her presence alone is good enough for me. It was also completely implausible. Frances tells her lawyer she has virtually no cash, her husband is requesting alimony, and apparently only receives her share of the equity from the sale of their house in the divorce settlement. Somehow, though, she has enough money to travel to Europe, purchase a dilapidated, yet elegant country estate in Italy, support herself AND employ a 3 man crew for at least 9 months for the renovation. C'mon.If you have a blu-ray player, your time won't be completely wasted by watching this because it really does have a ton of gorgeous scenery, including Diane. Not much is gained, though, by having the sound turned up.Too bad. The potential and the cast was there. Blame the screenwriter. I did.",

Although the Italian scenery is sublime, the storyline is too different from the book. The characters (though completely understandable in the book) do not seem connected to one another at all. I had problems following why characters, and their ecentricities, were introduced and I already knew the story!Diane Lane is beautiful and the scenery is gorgeous, but in the end I didn't &quot;care&quot; about any of the characters or the outcome. It just seemed to run out of steam (or water)...or maybe it was the absence of the adorable Italian from Positano :) In any case, take the time to read the book instead.",

    "review/text": "A couple of years ago I was given for Chrismas Frances Mayes' popular story of her adventures in Tuscany as a new owner of a dilapidated villa which she painstakingly restored, not without many adventures and misadventures. As Mayes discovered, Italy was most unlike her home in San Francisco and the Italian people she met did not share many of her values. The fun of the book was watching Mayes adapt to her new home and neighbors.I thought, mistakenly as it turns out, that the Hollywood film of her book would be faithful, at least in part, to her experiences in Italy. Unfortunatley, I was unable to recognize much of her original story in the Hollywood version of the book.In Amazon's spotlight review for this movie, Samuel McKewon does an excellent job in his critique of the film and I will not repeat any of his comments. I agree with McKewon even if most readers of his review do not.The book and movie are called \"Under the Tuscan Sun.\" We have some right to expect that Tuscany will play an important part in the film. Not so. The film opens with Mayes, played by Diane Lane, losing much of her property in a painful divorce. We are led to believe she is left with little money to begin her new life. We will find out that we are wrong in this inference.Mayes' friends give her a first class ticket to Tuscany. When she arrives, she leaves her tour almost immediately to purchase a run down villa in Cortina owned by an old contessa. The contessa drives a hard bargain, too steep for the Italian couple who compete with Mayes to buy the place. While Mayes herself is bargaining unsuccessfully with the contessa, a pidgeon defecates on her head. This is a sign for the contessa that Mayes should be the new owner of her 300 year old villa. This incident with the pidgeon is a warning to the viewer that the film is about to go into the toilet.When Mayes buys the house it is badly run down so she hires an old Italian carpenter and his three Polish assistants to rebuild the villa. A year later the three Polish workmen are still attempting to finish their repairs. Where Mayes got the money to buy the villa and pay three workmen for a year to do repairs is a mystery left unsolved. In fact, the only part the villa and workmen play in the story is as comic relief. Instead, we watch Mayes attempt to bring romance and love back into her life. For an intelligent, sophisticated women, she seems to be incredibly inept and immature.In the book the story of her adventures rebuilding her villa had a charm sadly missing in the film, which turned out to be a soap opera of her lovelife among the Italians. Instead of buying the film, viewers are advised to save their money and invest instead in the much cheaper paperback book. Here they will find the real Frances Mayes meeting and learning to love her new Italian neigbors.",

After the divorce Frances goes to Tuscany on a lark, falls in love with a villa there, buys it and proceeds to renovate it. The villa then is the physical manifestation of the shedding of her old life and marriage and the hope for the renovation and rehabilitation of her love life as well as her life in general.That she probably places too much faith in the physical to solve the emotional does not detract at all from the guts and hope that it takes to do so. And Lane is so psychically centered and open as Frances that you cannot help but be moved by her situation.There are some silly plot lines and performances that I wish weren't, but with a central performance as attractive and genuinely loving and feminine as Lane's, \"Under The Tuscan Sun\" is as warm and inviting as bread just out of the oven.",

I was not to be disappointed in being disappointed. Darkness couldn't come fast enough \"Under the Tuscan Sun.\"Diane Lane gets the unpleasant surprise of her life about her husband at a cocktail party. Her friends decide she needs to get away and send her to Italy for a little R & R. She notices a villa for sale and the old lady homeowner who is ambivalent about selling it to a wealthy German couple. Suddenly a pigeon discharges its plop on Diane's head. With such a tender and wonderful sign from above, the old lady decides to sell her home to her (presumably right after she washes her hair).So starts her new adventure.She has the usual run-of-the-mill problems with the house, and one of the friends who sent her on the trip in the first place, shows up pregnant. She helps a local through her love affair with a Polish construction worker, and has an affair where she cheers herself: \"I still got it.\" (With Diane Lane that's a real tough one to believe)! But after hearing that line, you might be asking yourself: \"Did somebody actually get paid for writing this?\"In the end, she finds her true love, a character who never develops because we see him inside the home through a window, and only at the end. (That way, Mr. Right doesn't even have to be listed in the credits).The only reason I have given this two stars is because the scenary was beautiful, and every women I have met since wants to go to Tuscany.

Italians are proud of who and how they are and although I didn't meet a single person who spoke english as well as anyone in this film, that was the only stretch as far as I could tell. Its an absolute pleasure to watch, especially for anyone who has been to Italy. And Diane Lane is adorable and full of life, almost inspirational.See this film if you want to escape to Italy for 2 hours and be a single, liberated, middle-aged woman going on an adventure. That's really what it is good for - transporting us americans away from our own \"culture\" and into a place that has a real sense of history and people.Cheesy - but delicious.",

No, really?As for the lesbian couple: They are committed enough to decide to have a baby (no accidents here), so try to concieve repeatedly (making reference that they were finally sucessful concieving on the 5th try) and then when one is apparently 8 months pregnant, the other decides she \"isn't ready to be a mother\"!

It's to show how even if she wasn't with someone, she can still be happy and her life can still be filled with flavour. That's why all the potential guys in the movie entered and left the screen.

    "review/text": "This film was a very pleasant surprise. I picked it out as a movie for my girlfriend and I to watch, since I had heard good things about it several years ago. This IS a chick-flick type of movie, but it definitely does not follow the same VERY tired romantic-comedy formula script that Hollywood loves to crank out. Yes, I suppose Under The Tuscan Sun is a romantic comedy, but it is a GOOD one, and it is fairly original in its approach.First, I should say the beautiful Diane Lane is a really great actress, and plays her part perfectly here. You truly believe in her character, which really adds to the believability of the film (suspension of disbelief is important to enjoying a movie). Most of the supporting cast does an excellent job as well (with the slight exception of \"Stone Face\" Sandra Oh, her face always seems devoid of emotion to me). Probably the most important member of the supporting cast is the SCENERY. The landscapes showcased in this movie are gorgeous and pretty astonishing. The excellent cinematography takes full advantage of the beautiful scenery Italy provides, and the movie is all the better for it.While the film is not outright original per se, it does take a rather fresh approach to romantic comedy, and you won't be able to predict what is going to happen far in advance (when's the last time you could say that about a romantic comedy??). The script is very good, with quite a few laughs and excellent pacing, and the dialogue is sharp. All in all, a VERY GOOD movie that both men and women can enjoy.A couple of other things: apparently, the film radically departs from the novel. I didn't read the book (and have no intention of doing so). You won't need to read the book to enjoy this movie. Also, I read a few gripes about Diane Lane not being 'beautiful' because she is 'old'. A matter of opinion I guess, but to me she looks fantastic in this movie at 38... and she really IS a great actress.Under The Tuscan Sun is RECOMMENDED for anyone looking for a 'couples' movie that both will enjoy (but Macho He-Men shouldn't bother, you only like Rambo type movies).",

She finds out the hard way that her husband is having an affair and gets a divorce, although she ends up losing her house to her ex (he 'pays' her for about half of it), so she decides to follow a friend Patti's advice (Oh) and travel to Tuscany. While visiting the little town of Cortona, Frances has a &quot;terrible idea&quot; and decides to buy a Villa.The Villa needs a lot of repairs and Francesca (as the locals start calling her) hires a band of misfit Polish workers. As time passes and work on her Villa goes on, Frances' life changes completely. She gets absorbed by the &quot;Italian&quot; way of life - not worrying so much about everything, enjoying life and not lingering on sad memories.This is a fine romantic comedy. Perhaps one of the best of the last couple of years. It's a shame that it wasn't noticed by more people (it's box office was barely over 43MM). Diane Lane shines in her role and Sandra Oh is really funny in the few moments she gets (she is the scene stealer of the film). The rest of the characters are perfectly cast with what I'm assuming to be European actors.But the one thing that makes this movie worth watching (I could go so far as to say owning, but nah!) are the gorgeous Tuscan landscapes. The beautiful little towns, the fabulous Villas, the pebble paved streets, the beautiful flower covered fields. There's also the little town by the sea where Marcello (Frances' love interest) lives. Unfortunately I didn't catch the name, otherwise I'd be taking a plane there right this moment. Keep an eye of cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson (Shine, Little women), because he shot a gorgeous looking movie.The only downside I found is that there's a couple of scenes in which the movies turns to magical realism. I didn't feel those scenes fit with the rest of the movie. Maybe it's just me.",

    "review/text": "UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by Frances Mayes, is one of those fantasies of escape likely to appeal to those leading lives of quiet desperation.Diane Lane plays Frances, who's just undergone a bitter divorce made more insulting by the fact that ex-hubbie buys out her share of the house using money supplied by his new woman. Frances moves into an apartment block that specializes in sheltering the recently divorced. The lawyer next door sobs a lot. Then, two of Frances's lesbian friends gift her with a ticket for a tour of Tuscany. So, off she goes, ultimately to impulsively purchase a run-down villa in the hill town of Cortona. Mayes spends the rest of the story overseeing the restoration of her new digs by a local contractor employing three expatriate Poles, and searching for a new lease on Love.My wife liked this film more than I, but admitted it's a chick flick. I'm giving it four stars chiefly because both Diane Lane and the Italian locations are gorgeous. The whole point of the film is to get the demoralized Frances to the point where she can again say, &quot;I'm emotionally OK and ready to boogie.&quot; A disclaimer in the ending credits states that some characters were altered to enhance the dramatic action. Perhaps buffed up too much in some cases, and not enough in others.For me, the film would have been a much better story had it focused on Frances, the villa's reconstruction, and the engaging personalities of the Poles (Pawel Szajda, Valentine Pelka, and Sasa Vulicevic), and created a relationship with her helpful real estate agent, the sensitive and maturely handsome Martini (Vincent Riotta). However, the screenwriters have Frances involved in too many other subplots requiring an excess of supporting players. There's Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a flamboyant ex-actress and Fellini protege, who's only purpose in the storyline seems to be to dance in a fountain and advise on how to find men, in this case equated with ladybugs - essentially, &quot;lie down in the grass and let them come to you&quot;. Then there's gay pal Patti (Sandra Oh), who shows up to have a baby. And hunky Marcello (Raoul Bova), straight off the lurid cover of some bodice-ripper, who admittedly goes a long way in restoring Mayes's sexual self-esteem. (My wife thought Marcello totally necessary to the plot.) Indeed, one of the best scenes has Mayes doing a private victory dance to celebrate the fact that she's still &quot;got it.&quot;Diane Lane's last outing (UNFAITHFUL) garnered her a well-deserved Oscar nomination. Her role in UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN is nowhere near to being as accomplished a performance. But for this viewer, who's been in love with Ms. Lane since her appearance in 1989's LONESOME DOVE as the sweetly vulnerable prostitute Lorena, it more than sufficed as an endorphin fix.",

    "review/text": "I'd call this a \"chick flick,\" but that's insulting to women on at least two levels -- the term and to suggest that women as a group would find this collection of hoary cinematic cliches the least bit interesting. The true stars of the movie are the Italian countryside, wonderfully photographed in all seasons, and the house, but basically this is one of those Home and Garden TV fixer upper shows with a multi-million dollar budget. Diane Lane is supposed to be a tough, unsentimental reviewer whose barbed jibes stay with authors for years. This hardly tracks with her character, who immediately falls for any pretty, vacant, younger male face who wanders into her field of vision, and then is shocked, SHOCKED (Casablanca-style) when she turns out to be a mere dalliance for him. Also from the cliche mill -- the plucky lesbian, Asian for diversity interest, who has been abandoned mid-pregnancy by her lover and heads off to Tuscany to have her baby (Sandra Oh does get the one really funny line in the movie, however, when a toilet bubbles over with hot water and she observes that it's really useful if you want to \"give your butt a facial.\"); the handsome middle-aged Italian who has \"never cheated on my wife,\" but always turns up without her and with sage advice; and finally the old, eccentric Englishwoman, long-time resident of the town who is fond of nuzzling ducklings against her cheek in the farmers' market (Lane's character finds this fascinating), poses nude for her younger painter lovers, and dances drunk in fountains like a Fellini character.To all of this many others reviewing here apparently say \"terrific.\" This dissenting view says, \"Ugh.\"",

    "review/text": "American author Frances Mayes, was best known for published poetry work and also being the Professor of Creative Writing, director of the Poetry Center and chair of the Department of Creative Writing at San Francisco University.But in 1996, Frances would release her memoir, \"Under the Tuscan Sun\", based on her experience of purchasing an abandoned villa in rural Cortona in Tuscany, Italy. The memoir was a success and was number one on the New York Times Best Sellers list for over two years.The memoir would eventually receive a film adaptation in 2003 courtesy of filmmaker/writer Audrey Wells (\"George of the Jungle\", \"Shall We Dance?\", \"The Game Plan\"). And the film would star actress Diane Lane (\"The Perfect Storm\", \"Unfaithful\", \"Jumper\"), Sandra Oh (\"Grey's Anatomy\", \"Sideways\", \"Hard Candy\"), Lindsay Duncan (\"Alice in Wonderland\", \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\") and Vincent Riotta (\"The Dark Knight\", \"Revolver\", \"Heaven\"), plus a cameo from one of Italian's legendary filmmakers Mario Monicelli.Having been released on DVD back in 2003, \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" was released on Blu-ray in July 2012.VIDEO:\"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1). A major positive about \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is the location of where the film is shot in Italy is absolutely beautiful. Cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson (\"Fried Green Tomatoes\", \"Little Women\", \"Shine\") did a wonderful job of capturing the beauty of Italy through this film. Colors are vibrant during the outdoor scenes, closeups feature detail on the faces of the talent, black levels are nice and deep and much better clarity of this film on Blu-ray vs. its DVD counterpart.I detected no artifacts, banding or any problems while viewing this film. If anything, fans of \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" will enjoy the HD transfer of this film.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:\"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital. For a romantic comedy, dialogue is crystal clear and while there is some music, the film is primarily dialogue driven coming through the front and center channels. But the surround channels are used. Quite effectively during the storm sequence and also for ambiance, especially during scenes with a larger crowd. Overall, the lossless soundtrack for \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" was good and quite appropriate for a romantic comedy.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES\"Under the Tuscan Sun\" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with director Audrey Wells. Wells talks about the film adaptation of \"Under the Tuscan Sun\", working with the talent and crew, shooting in various locations in Italy plus the costume and set design.Tuscany 101 Making of Featurette - (9:26) Featuring interviews with filmmaker Audrey Wells, author Frances Mayes and the cast regarding the \"Under the Tuscan Sun\".Deleted Scenes - (2:31) Featuring three deleted scenes.JUDGMENT CALL:For any adult who has been married and then finding themselves divorced, especially after their 40&#8242;s, it's a frightening experience.It's one thing to start over from scratch, when you are younger but when you are older, you just never know what is out there, whether you still have what it takes to get into a new relationship but mostly the fear of starting over.What I enjoyed about \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is the fact that it's based on the real-life memoir of Frances Mayes and that Diane Keaton would play the character with efficacy.A romantic comedy shot in a beautiful location, \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is a movie that many divorcees can relate to (ore those who have ended a long relationship with their partner), because these are issues that many people face. The difference is that not many people get the opportunity to escape to Italy or another country.So, watching the film, you can't help but laugh and be delighted by the character of Frances Mayes, as she tries to find her way in Italy. Yes, she is aware about Italian men (and we see many scenes with Italian men trying to get her attention), especially the number of Italian men who are attracted to Frances, but yet are married. It's a different culture than America but it's quite fascinating to see it all happen in Italy and see how the character of Frances manages to learn about herself through the people she meets and dates.But there is no doubt that the film is quite irresistible due to its location. From the beautiful buildings to the local merchants, to seeing Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) being a bit La Dolce Vitta or to see Frances Mayes learning to cook Italian food and preparing it for her Polish workers. Suffice to say, it's a fun film with plenty of enjoyable supporting actors.\"Grey's Anatomy\" actress Sandra Oh stars alongside then fellow \"Grey's Anatomy\" co-star Kate Walsh as a lesbian couple expecting a baby. Pawel Szajda as Pawel, the Polish immigrant who has fallen for the Italian Chiara (as portrayed by Giulia Steigerwalt). Two y0ung people who have fallen in love but whether or not her parents would support their relationship because he is Polish (and has no major job).The acting performance was well-done but Diane Lane absolutely shined in this film and was delightful to watch in this film!As for the Blu-ray release, the video quality is an upgrade over the DVD release. Lossless audio definitely sounds great via the surround channels, may it be the storm sequence or crowd ambiance, \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" looks and sounds great via HD. As for special features, it's pretty much the same special features on the original DVD - audio commentary, deleted Scenes and a short making-of featurette.But overall, \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" was a fun romantic comedy. Granted, there is no major male co-star to go along with Diane Lane, but that's perfectly fine. This whole film is about a divorcee starting over with her life and learning more about herself and the fact that the world is not going to end. And no matter how scary life can be at this new chapter in a divorcee's life, you move forward and keep living your life.If you are a fan of this 2003 film or just wanting a beautiful, delightful romantic comedy on Blu-ray that is not so much focused on a relationship but more about one woman coming off a long relationship and starting over in a foreign country, then definitely give \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" a try!",

In some regards the movie reminds me of \"A Year in Provence,\" the renovation of the old house, the gradual making of new friends, and the language challenge are major themes in both movies. In both of these movies the frustrations, challenges, and opportunities result in a happy, fulfilled ending that leave you feeling good about things. That's not bad!Frances is a sympathetic character to me and I found myself rooting for her to make a go of it; Diane Lane does a compelling job of playing the part of a vulnerable, yet determined woman with lots of inner strength.As a guy, I too like the action and adventure movies, but, thanks to my wife, have had the opportunity to discover that I can also enjoy some of the more romantic and gentler movies.In summary, if you can let yourself be charmed by an attractive and sympathetic woman trying to live her life, beautiful scenery, interesting supporting characters, and a happy ending I think you'll enjoy this movie.We certainly did!",

As a recent divorcee, she is sad and struggling to find herself and figure out what she wants out of life. The bursts of sadness and loneliness she experiences throughout the movie are heartening and lend credence to her plight-she is a middle-aged woman, who has lost her home and has been tossed aside by her uncaring husband - and she is clearly not going to get over it just because she has moved to a (soon to be) fabulous villa in Tuscany. I appreciated this detail because in many movies, the actors behave in a way that is totally inconsistent with how real life would play out.Grab some popcorn and your girlfriends, maybe a Kleenex or two, and enjoy!",

    "review/text": "Though officially based on a true story - the autobiographical bestseller by Frances Mayes - \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" plays like one of those slick fiction \"women's pictures\" (now called \"chick flicks\") from the 1950's and 1960's in which a beautiful woman (usually played by Lana Turner or Jean Seberg), unlucky in the ways of love, heads to Europe in the hopes of finding true romance in the arms of the heavily-accented man of her dreams.This glossy, shallow and superficial soap opera stars Diane Lane as Frances, a semi-successful writer who discovers that her husband is cheating on her with another woman. After the divorce, in which somehow the husband has managed to finagle almost everything including the house away from her as part of the settlement, Frances agrees to go on a gay bus tour through Italy that two lesbian friends have set up for her. While on a stopover in Tuscany, the usually far-from-impulsive Frances decides, on the spur of the moment, to purchase a villa replete with bad plumbing and acres upon acres of olive trees. Without any discernible source of income to make it all possible, Frances divides her time between making major repairs on the place and cavorting all over the Italian countryside, having \"adventures\" with the colorful native and immigrant population and falling under the spell of the handsome young Italian who always seems to be just waiting in the wings in stories such as these. But is he really the right man for her? Needless to say, with all this going on, we don't see this \"author\" getting a whole lot of writing done during this overseas sojourn (though, at the end, we find that she`s somehow managed - apparently off-camera - to write a whole book about her experiences here).Diane Lane is so fine an actress that she is able to make even this hokey pablum almost believable at times. For the most part, though, the film is a case of missed opportunities. For instance, nothing whatsoever is done with the gay tour aspect of the plot (one suspects that the film might have been more interesting had Frances STAYED on the bus rather than gotten off, as I`m sure a group of gay guys would have known how to have more fun in Italy than she does), and Frances' own story winds up taking a back seat to a bland Romeo and Juliet-type subplot and a whole host of stereotypical minor characters. Every time Lane begins to bring some depth and reality to her character, the romantic fantasy trappings pile on to overwhelm her.Apart from Lane's performance and the eye-popping views of the Italian landscape, \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" offers little for the non-armchair traveler to feast on.",

But it also didn't really appeal as subject matter AND I had never read the book either. Having said all of that - I did really enjoy this film. It is funny and enjoyable and has a pleasant, uplifting tone to it. Diane Lane was sexy and again gave a great performance like last years 'Unfaithful' for which she was Oscar nominated. The supporting characters in the movie were very entertaining and the Tuscan hills looked spectacular. This is a very good movie that I would recommend even to other guys. Give it a try.",

    "review/text": "I'm in love with Diane Lane. I honestly wish that her career post-Oscar nomination would have been slightly better (or a whole lot better) than what it was, but I'm just happy that she's still working, and she really does bring a lot to what she does. The year following her Oscar nominated turn in `Unfaithful' (where she should have won in a cakewalk) she put out one of those standard chick-flick type rom-coms that get made every other month. Basically the `Eat Pray Love' of the 2000's (just far less muddled and unfocused), `Under the Tuscan Sun' is basic and predictable and yet elevated thanks to Lane's dedicated performance that the focus brought to fleshing out the depth in the story.The film follows Frances, a middle aged married woman who is under the impression that her life is fine until her husband leaves her. It was sudden and depressing yet she picks up (at the urging of her friends) and moves on, halfway around the world, to Italy. She buys a villa, that needs a lot of work, and then sets off on an adventure of self-re-discovery as she chases what she thinks she needs and ultimately finds what has been eluding her all along.If you can get past the idea that this is yet `another one of those movies' you can see the magic in every frame. Lane is a revelation, delivering a great performance that truly lifts the film to places it couldn't have gone without her. The cinematography and mere sets alone are spellbinding (having just been to Tuscany I can say that it really is as magical as these films make it look) and the way that the story develops is also quite admirable because it doesn't exactly follow that generic formula (especially when concerning Frances's love interests).It is well worth a gander, especially if you are a fan of these types of chick-flicks. It may be nearly ten years old (man, how the time flies) but it still holds up upon recent viewings and is the perfect film for a cozy night in with your significant other and a tall glass of wine.",

Along the way she makes unexpected friendships, and becomes instrumental in helping others find happiness in love, and she does some excellent food preparations for the workers on the villa.

This movie is a gem and is worth watching for the beautiful scenery alone. PLUS for once you get a very good voice over narration which adds to the charm of this movie. Frances is such a classy and gracious lady that she still believes in the Power Of Love although she has yet to find it herself. 5 stars for this must see movie.",

After the divorce Frances goes to Tuscany on a lark, falls in love with a villa there, buys it and proceeds to renovate it. The villa then is the physical manifestation of the shedding of her old life and marriage and the hope for the renovation and rehabilitation of her love life as well as her life in general.That she probably places too much faith in the physical to solve the emotional does not detract at all from the guts and hope that it takes to do so. And Lane is so psychically centered and open as Frances that you cannot help but be moved by her situation.There are some silly plot lines and performances that I wish weren't, but with a central performance as attractive and genuinely loving and feminine as Lane's, &quot;Under The Tuscan Sun&quot; is as warm and inviting as bread just out of the oven. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title",

I thought the acting was fantastic, everyone was very well cast. There were quite funny parts during which I laughed out loud and a couple of times when I had to pause the movie to weep. I suppose I am a sentimental sap, but I wouldn't wish to be any other way. I guess it all depends on who you are, your personal beliefs and experiences, and where you are in your own life whether or not you'll truly feel this movie. I felt it to the depths of my soul. Although I am not, nor have ever been in the exact same situation as Frances, it is very easy to relate to her. There were moments when I felt the movie was made just for me. I thought one of the most beautiful parts of the movie is the relationship between Frances and Mr. Martini...the dialogue, the unspoken thoughts, the subtle physical gestures of the actors...wonderful. In summary, it has become one of my favourite movies. It reminds us that though we may feel trapped and that the world has caved in on us and we can't possibly bear the pain, life is still there to be lived, and yes, amazing things will happen even when we least expect them.

It disturbs me to no end that people who claim to uphold the highest moral standards would blatantly lie in order to oppress a group of people.The truth is- there *IS* no gay agenda to this film. There is a supporting character who is lesbian, and her partner leaves her in the middle of her pregnancy. The focus is not on their sexuality or relationship, but on what it's like to start over alone, as a single mother. All relationships, gay or straight, are challenged by the same issues. It's incredibly sad that ONE GAY CHARACTER in a film constitutes a gay agenda to so many people.Honestly, the film isn't a great piece of art. It's just a warm, funny movie about someone who takes a risk and learns a little bit about life along the way. I'd much rather my children see this, with it's so called \"gay agenda\" than any film with tons of violence and straight sexual content.",

Oh, hum. Still, I could have enjoyed the movie, but like every Hollywood movie, or TV show lately it had to feature the homosexual lifestyle as a subplot. Middle age woman has homosexual friends. Middle-aged woman joins a homosexual Tuscany tour. Middle age woman has lesbian friend who stays with her who has baby courteous of who knows whom. (Is this child better off without a father? Why would a child want a father and a mother when he can have two mommies!). Hey, guys, this is supposed to be a romantic chic flick.

    "review/text": "Welcome to Tuscany - a region of Italy known for its breathtaking old-world scenery, charming people, and the plumpest grapes, which are used to produce the finest bouquet of wines this side of Napa Valley. This is also the place where a recently divorced, down on her luck writer, Frances (Diane Lane) retreats (at the request of friends) to begin a life anew, free from her recent setback...or so Frances thought. Our young writer's problems really begin to take shape as soon as she purchases a 300 year old house, located on the edge of a fairly modest village in the Tuscan countryside. Once settled in, Frances finds that she gets more than she bargained for, including a relationship with a suave, handsome Italian corner store owner (Raoul Bova). Frances' relationship with this attracive young individual is one of the most touching moments of \"Under The Tuscan Sun\". Sandra Oh gives a rather dramatic performance as Frances' best friend, who, is as surprised and as shocked as anyone, when she learns of Frances' decision that she has bought an old, broken down slum of a dilapidated heap of a house, therefore wondering if Frances' brain was on autopilot when making such a spur-of-the-moment decision! Ah, but as is sometimes the case, there is indeed a silver lining tucked beneath this ominously dark cloud, for our temporarliy displaced writer does not travel this journey alone. Also along on this Tuscan sojourn, are a family of Polish immigrants (who work cheaply and dilgently in struggling to get the house in order), as well as a worldly English woman (who, like Eric Idle's character in \"National Lampoon's European Vacation\", pops up unexpectedly). There are also other living things on this journey as well - in the form of arachnids and slimey reptiles. Blecch! With so much taking place in its two hours of undisputed mayhem and glory, \"Under The Tuscan Sun\" combines the melodrama of a soap opera, with the wit and wisdom of an intellectual novel (upon which this picture is based). You'll need a handkerchief handy while sitting through some of this film's most touching moments. Like Tuscany's many winding pathways contained in many of its villages, there's always a maze of adventure and excitement just waiting \"under the sun\". Reserve your ticket (at a bargain basement price) at a theater near you soon...that is, while supplies last! Oh, and the Tuscan cuisine is mouth-watering, too.",

    "review/text": "Based on the book by Frances Mayes, Under The Tuscan Sun is a refreshing fish out of water romantic comedy. After taking a much needed vacation, a recently divorced writer buys a home in Tuscany on a whim, hoping the new home will jump start her journey to newfound happiness. Most likely to be categorized in the 'chick flick' realm, Under The Tuscan Sun follows the life of one woman as she interacts with friends, lovers, and new neighbors in an exotic and beautiful environment. The film portrays all the emotions - the ups and downs, the hopes and dreams - experienced by the main character as she takes on this monumental and spontaneous adventure. In short, Under The Tuscan Sun is an interesting, and oftentimes hilarious, film that tackles the constant travails of life in general...Thirty-something San Francisco writer Frances (Diane Lane) spirals into a deep depression when her ten-year marriage ends in divorce. To further complicate matters, she lives in a cramped apartment, and the stress of her divorce has left her with writer's block. Her good friend Patti (Sandra Oh), happily pregnant and involved in her own committed relationship, tries to cheer up Frances. But nothing seems to work - at least until a vacation is suggested.When Frances sets off on a tour of Italy, she unexpectedly gets off the bus and purchases a villa in Tuscany. Hundreds of years old and in disrepair, the home is in dire need of massive renovations. Frances devotes her new life to restoring the home, and she hires a ragtag band of immigrants and local people to help her. Meanwhile, she attempts to find love in her new country, but the harder she tries, the worse off things turn out. When Patti's lesbian lover leaves, she moves to Tuscany for the moral support offered by Frances. Now, Patti must give birth to a new life, and Frances must learn that the best rewards in life arrive when least expected...Sideways star Sandra Oh makes a name for herself playing the role of Patti, a good friend of Frances. Despite her appearance in a dozen plus films, Under The Tuscan Sun is the first time I can recall seeing Sandra Oh in a movie, and I can remember that she really made an impression. She has a distinctive onscreen presence, something unique that I can't quite identify, and perhaps this contributes in some small way to the current success she's experiencing.Meanwhile, Diane Lane creates a likeable and relatable character in Frances. Viewers will have no problem relating to divorcee's struggles within her personal life, and even the most pessimistic and dour of movie goers must give her credit for making such a bold move. As such, Under The Tuscan Sun manages to create one of those rare films which isn't so much plot-driven, nor focused on the personality of a monumental life. The film simply serves as a good night's entertainment (and a break, if one is needed, from the typical big money, high body count Hollywood productions). That's why Under The Tuscan Sun is a definite must-see film...The DVD Report",

I have actually tolerated every Meg Ryan romantic comedy and other movies of that genre but this ...!!!!! The movie slips in some of the Hollywood social values that have disturbed many Americans in the so called \"red states.\" Diane Lane stars as a recently divorced woman who is coming to terms with her life. She has two close friends, a lesbian couple and, of course in grand Hollywood style, they are seeking to become parents. This is an issue that is debated in this country, but, predictably enough in this movie, it is treated matter of factly as though this is the norm (but then again, the norm is whatever the Hollywood elite says it is).Anyway, this couple gets their newly divorced friend to take a trip to Italy on a tour for gay people. She goes and falls in love with a house in Tuscany which needs tons of work. She bolts from the tour and somehow has enough money to purchase this house and get it fixed up. Her ensuing romantic dilemnas are too much even for even my high tolerance for sickening schmaltz. Because of the delightful escapism of the beautiful settings of Tuscany, I will grudgingly give this movie three stars.",

Immense, and needing lots of work, one has to wonder what came over her. The contractors are a rag-tag group that slowly becomes her friends and her family. Frances immerses herself in the local community. Trying to start over, she falls in love with a stranger. In despair one morning, she wishes that there was family to fill her house, and that a wedding would take place there. Once the repairs on the house are done, the contractors leave. Her very pregnant lesbian friend from the States comes to stay with her. She encourages two young lovers to follow their hearts and get married. Somewhat bleak and depressing at first, you feel her desperate need to find herself, and to feel loved once again.

One of the things that kept bugging me about the movie was how much money must the character have made off of her divorce, to be able buy and remodel a Tuscan villa while not working for a living.On the side, I can see how some people would find objectionable the fact that, in essence, the divorce of the main character is largely compared with the breakup between her friend Patti and her lesbian partner later in the movie. As a matter of fact, this and the introduction of her partner as an open character in the movie, are elements that make me dismiss this movie as being your typical \"pink\", \"sunday afternoon\" chick flick, which I really appreciate in times when the whole gay marriage controversy is being addressed more openly. In that sense, the movie goes along with the times, as much as you may differ in criteria with the values it promotes.As a whole, controversial in some ways and unrealistic as it results at times, the movie results enjoyable, with landscapes of the Tuscan hills and beautiful views of the Mediterranean accentuating a nice performance by Diane Lane.",

    "review/text": "&quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; is at turns a delightful and sad romantic comedy romp full of a number of clever and unexpected twists and turns. San Francisco writer Frances Mayes ( Diane Lane) discovers her husband's affair and the discovery shatters her life. When he seeks alimony, she's forced to sell him the house that they renovated together with her mother's money. At first she takes residence in an apartment building where it seems everyone is lamenting a lost love or smarting over a divorce. As the first anniversary of her &quot;freedom&quot; looms, a lesbian friend takes her out to dinner and makes her an offer she can't refuse. She gives Frances a ticket to Italy. Frances is afraid of finding new romance. It's not something she's likely to do on the trip however as the tour is for gays and lesbians and her friend is unable to go because she's pregnant.While out and about on her own, she sees a picture of a villa for sale. On the spur of the moment she decides to purchase it. She wants to radically reshape her life and sees this as the opportunity to do so. With the blessing of pigeon poop on her head (evidently a &quot;sign&quot; to the elderly owner that she deserves the old and crumbling villa), Frances earns the right to purchase the place. What ensues is beautiful scenery, a series of comedic and sad events as she remodels her new villa culminating in an unexpected second chance at romance.Based on Frances Mayes' best-selling book, Audrey Wells has fashioned a memorable and unpredictable romantic comedy about second chances. If you're a fan of Mayes' book you may be disappointed. The basic premise is similar but, beyond that, the film has little to do with Mayes book. My advice, get it over it and enjoy the movie for what it is not what it isn't.Filled with memorable character actors from Italy, American and the UK, &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; eschews the typical formula seen in Nora Epstein's movies in favor of a series of unpredictable and interesting plot twists. Diane Lane gives a marvelous performance as Frances Mayes (which I should note is a fictionalized version of the author as the book has little to do with the novel beyond the setting and basic premises) a soul who has lost her way in the bitter aftermath of divorce. The renewal she finds with the renovation of her new villa and friendships she establishes along the way makes for a rewarding and touching film experience.The widescreen anamorphic transfer looks lovely capturing all the crisp, bright colors of Italy. There's no analog artifacts whatsoever and virtually no edge enhancement problems. &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; has been lovingly transferred from film to video without any of the usual analog to digital problems. The sound mix is as warm and sunny as the Italian landscape. While the 5.1 sound isn't used as successfully as say, an action picture, there's plenty of subtle detail to be heard and appreciated. The feeling of Italy envelops the listener with this carefully prepared transfer.There are the usual deleted scenes, some of which add a bit of additional character touches. The making of featurette &quot;Tuscany 101&quot; provides a nice glimpse into the production and thought process of the writer/director Audrey Wells and her star. There are also cast and filmmaker interviews and a glimpse into some of the challenges and rewards of shooting in Italy.Writer/director Audrey Wells provides an insightful and informative commentary track. It's a pity that Diane Lane and some of the Italian actors weren't included in the process. It would have been very interesting to get the Italian actors take on an American romantic comedy.A delightful and touching film, &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; will provide an evening of great entertainment. Diane Lane is, as usual, marvelous in the lead performance. Great care has been taken to preserve the look of the film and the transfer is truly spectacular looking.",

    "review/text": "A while ago we saw Diane Lane give a terrific performance in the movie \"Unfaithful\", which was a remake of Claude Chabrol's \"La Femme Infidel\". The film itself was uneven, but Diane Lane was so good as the straying wife that she was nominated for an Academy Award.In \"Under The Tuscan Sun\" Diane Lane once again gives a very good performance. The problem is that \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is not even half the film that \"Unfaithful\" was. I don't really like defining movies as chick flicks or otherwise, but there's really no other way to describe this one. And it's a movie for not very discerning chicks at that.It's based on Francis Mayes book of the same name, a book that hit the bestseller lists largely because it was the stuff of many a middle-class fantasy: one day I'm going to walk away from all this and get back to a simpler live in the countryside of Provence, or Sardinia, or Greece, or Tuscany.The book has its devoted fans. It also has its ardent critics, most of whom were put off by Francis Mayes' egocentricity and her somewhat patronising view of the quaint locals. So self-involved is the writer that many readers can't even figure out who the mysterious man is that is accompanying her as the villa in Tuscany gets renovated. A husband? A lover? Or what?Well, whatever he is Audrey Wells, the writer and director of the film didn't want him around. She felt that the story of a couple renovating a house didn't have enough dramatic potential, so in this version Diane Lane's character discovers her husband has been unfaithful, divorces him, and heads off to Italy to rebuild her life and her heart. That, of course, makes this all very much a chick flick. It even has all the clich&eacute;s that such a film should have. Jokes about women's liking for chocolate. The gay best friend Patti (played by Sandra Oh). In fact there's a whole coach load of gay friends in this one. There's the old meet cute. There's the woman who is divorced but whom virtually every man seems to fancy. There's a childbirth scene. And a wedding scene. And of course there's the dashing European, Marcello (Raoul Bova), who is just as fickle as the husband she has just divorced but who is revealed to be not quite so nasty because ... well ... he's continental. When a married Italian guy or two go after our heroine, it's OK because they are European and it's expected. When her American husband does the same thing it's grounds for divorce. And of course, you just know that this estrogen fest has to have a new and more long lasting love in it somewhere, even if that love does take a long time to turn up. There's also a character who's intended to be one of the girlz in a \"Sex and the City\" kind of way, but is actually quite a sad case, something the movie avoids pointing except for one brief scene, and then takes back by the end.It's awful.I'm sorry. I know that some women who want solace for the soul or the broken heart may get something from it. But it's a terrible movie. It's all so calculating and by the numbers. I don't think a romantic movie clich&eacute; is missed from beginning to end, although they're also all overlaid here with a kind of half baked politically correct liberalism. Do women really want a Latin lover who says, and I'm not kidding: \"I am going to make love all over you\". I've seen porn movies like that that, but is this really the stuff of romance?But you should know what to expect. Audrey Wells previously wrote that other major victimised chick flick: \"The Truth About Cats and Dogs.\" That's another film that some women found a devastating reflection of men's simple minded obsession with physical beauty without realising that it was actually \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" in reverse, and thus just as critical of the distaff side as of testosterone poisoned males.I can't even say, for \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" that it's beautifully photographed. Geoffrey Simpson is the cinematographer. But Tuscany is so beautiful that no one could help capturing some of its beauties, or if they could they should be shot, and not merely by a camera.The only reason to watch \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is the luminous Diane Lane.\"The film itself is terrible, and manipulative, but if you're willing to sit through all this nonsense for a wonderful performance by the beautiful, but by Hollywood terms over the hill, Diane Lane, you might get something from it. Otherwise forget it.",

The one person she has real chemistry with, the realtor is married, so it's like, how is this going to work out? I really didnt like the don juan she meets in the oddest way in Rome, from the start you knew what he was, surprisingly she did not. The way the movie ends, is so abrupt, it's like..well, uh, o.k., we know nothing about this hirsuit man, but I guess she's happy. This is based on a memoir and it just seems so contrived, I dont know what I expected, but all and all I wish she had ended up with the married realtor, but then that would have been messy and this being a by the numbers chick flick, that just will not do. This just proved what i've always said, Diane Lane is so good, she can make anything soar, or at least get a little off the ground, she's not a miracle worker.",

    "review/text": "The exhilaration of the Tuscany landscape just compells you to say Il tuo sorriso e' il sole della mia vita (Your smile is the sunshine of my life) .. Diane Lane gives a deeply endearing and enrapturing performance as a heartbroken writer remaking her life and a villa in Italy. Based on the literary travel memoirs of San Francisco journalist Frances Mayes, Under the Tuscan Sun is a testament to one of the most lion-hearted things the human heart can do - have the courage to love again despite the scars of betrayal, abandonment, and traumatic sorrow. In the blink of an eye Frances Mayes' world is turned upside-down when a seemingly happy marriage ends in divorce. Life as she knows it is in tatters and Frances switches scenery to recover from a shattering experience. From the salt air of San Francisco to the kiss of the Tuscan sun rays does Frances slowly recuperate the fragments of her heart and a villa in need of some repair. On the way she re-experiences the magic and miracle of romance, a new love, and a life in Italy that she never imagined. If ever there is a doubt whether Italian (instead of French) is the language of love ... Under the Tuscan Sun settles the debate once and for all.If this book inspires your own trip to Italy, the following phrases will come in handy though they may not be in your travel phrase book: **WARNING - BEWARE of #12**1)Your eyes are like two stars in the night / I tuoi occhi sono come due stelle nella notte2)Your smile is the sunshine of my life / Il tuo sorriso e' il sole della mia vita3)Your lips are as sweet as honey / Le tue labbra sono dolci come il miele4)Your skin is like silk / La tua pelle e' come seta5)You are always in my heart / Tu sei sempre nel mio cuore6)My life without you is like day without sun / La mia vita senza te e' come il giorno senza il sole7)My love for you is deeper than the ocean / Il mio amore per te e' piu' profondo dell'oceano8)Everytime I kiss you I forget where I am / Ogni volta che ti bacio dimentico dove sono9)You make me melt like snow under the sun / Tu mi fai squagliare come neve al sole10)Come here and kiss me / Vieni qui e baciami11) I would like to spend all my life with you / Vorrei trascorrere tutta la mia vita con te12)Would you marry me? / Mi vuoi sposare/13)You are very beautiful / Tu sei bellissima14)You are my angel / Tu sei il mio angelo15)Forvige me my love / Perdonami amore mio16)It's all my fault / E' solo colpa mia17)Would you have dinner with me? / Vuoi cenare con me?18)Our love is forever / Il nostro amore e'eterno19)I only have eyes for you / Io ho occhi solo per te20)Ti amo / I love you",

    "review/text": "San Francisco based writer, college professor and book critic, Frances Mayes, hits the emotional skids when she is informed of her husband's extramarital affair and finds herself immersed in a divorce that lands her in a dismal hotel complex inhabited by sad and scarred victims of separation. Even though she is caught in the tailspin of her own disappointment, she accepts the gift of a trip to Tuscany from friends and embarks on a journey that will gradually fuel her life with optimism. On impulse, she purchases a ramshackle farmhouse in the countryside near Cortena and sets upon the seemingly impossible task of its renovation while simultaneously reinventing her own sensibilities and her lifestyle in general. As she toils under the Tuscan sun as an outsider to the town and its people, she finds herself becoming one of them, seeing each of the lives she encounters as an individual quest for La Dolce Vita so poignantly captured in Fellini's film and echoed by the aging Anita Ekberg wannabe who attempts to and advises Frances to retain a childlike innocence and exuberance when viewing any situation in the big bad world.With a lead like Diane Lane playing Frances, there must. of course, be a man, in this case a delicious hunk of Italian that cavalierly convinces Frances and the cameras to follow him from the ochre magnificence of Rome to the tiered splendor of the Amalfi coast. These sequences explode with so much visual pleasure the viewer sighs, involuntarily blinded by the sensual overload of color and sound and as expected, glimpses of both Lane and her lover as they frolic to the tune of the campanile's bells.For those who have read the book of the same name, there is no comparison. These are completely different stories. If you are expecting the idyllic sweetness of the book with its anecdotes of Italian life, forget it. The movie-Frances dwells on her divorce which springboards her into asking some of life's big questions, while the book-Frances has already worked all this out prior to writing the first page and immerses herself in the simple lovely indulgence of following the course of a sweet life of which she has already mapped out. The \"Ed\" that Frances finds at the end of the film, is with the book-Frances from the very start; in fact, they renovate the house together, content from the outset.I entered the theatre expecting this film to be mediocre based on the ubiquitous trailers seen on television which try far too hard to make the film seem cutsy rather than stimulating. My advise is to watch none of these sugary confections which take words of dialogue out of context to appeal to a certain audience; if you like all things Italian and are indeed, searching for a dolce vita of your own, go see the film. Disregard the obvious contrivances in the plot and prepare yourself to fall in love with the lush scenery that gently lulls that annoying sense of American expediency out of existence, for at least the two hour viewing time. Above all, view the film with the childlike pleasure of the Italians for whom every experience is a new one to be savored. Then go out and buy a copy of the book La Dolce Vita offered on Amazon.com to begin your own quest for the sweet life.",

    "review/text": "(3.5 stars) Based on the captivating memoir of author Frances Mayes, this fictionalized version of her story becomes a completely different creation--far more romantic, more predictable, and more obvious than the memoir. Here in the film, Frances, recovering from a devastating divorce, accepts a ten-day trip to Tuscany from two friends, leaves the tour group, and discovers and buys an abandoned villa. With her own imagination and the help of an inexperienced Polish crew, which has the predictable number of construction disasters, she renovates the old villa, always hoping that some day there will be a wedding, preferably her own to the perfect man, and a family to give life to the old place.The scenery is beautiful (of course), the vistas are endless and well-photographed, and the challenges of making the old house both livable and comfortable are never-ending. Walls falling down, a violent thunderstorm, a visiting owl, and unlimited problems with the plumbing keep the humor visual and the viewer amused. Frances's affair and the unexpected arrival of a pregnant friend from home add intrigue and keep the complications coming. A secondary Romeo-and-Juliet plot involving the teenaged daughter of one of her neighbors and the Polish teenager working on Frances's house, add \"depth\" to Frances's own search for romantic happiness. Ultimately, the film ends as the viewer expects it will--romantically satisfying.The subtlety of the book, with its lovely descriptions of the countryside and its people and its sense of reality, are sacrificed here in favor of visual excitement, humor, and ongoing love stories, and Frances's (real) self-discovery becomes trite moralizing in the film, as seen in the quotation that begins this review. Diane Lane is charming as Frances, but she, nevertheless, looks older than the young men to whom she seems to be attracted, and the gay subplot involving her friends and the tour which brings her to Tuscany are extraneous (but politically correct). Highly romantic and fun to watch, this film is a disappointingly Hollywood-ized version of a thoughtful and charming memoir. n Mary Whipple",

    "review/text": "The imagery in this movie is fantastic (obviously, since it was filmed in Tuscany), however I can't really recommend anything else about it. For some reason the writers of this film strayed so far from the original story as penned by Frances Maye that it is almost a completely different story. Which is sad, by the way, because the true story is so charming and would have been superb on film. Frances Maye's book, Under the Tuscan Sun, is the true story of how she and her husband Ed buy a run-down villa in Tuscany. The book recounts the adventures Frances and Ed have together while remodeling the house. Other than the part about buying a house in Tuscany, there's really not much else in the movie that even comes close to the book. Ed doesn't even appear in the film until literally the last three minutes. Instead of a happily married and successful writer, Maye is portrayed as a depressed divorcee who is only able to come out of her funk after having a one-night stand with a suave Italian named Marcello (what were you people thinking?). And for some strange reason, there's this bizarre homosexual motif that runs through the entire first half-hour of the movie. Why in the world did the writers have Frances discover the villa on a gay romantic tour of Italy, when the real story would have been so much better? I guess my advice to you is read the book, skip the movie. Or better yet, read the book then go and see A Year in Provence, which is much better.",

    "review/text": "Having read Frances Mayes' travelogue UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN: AT HOME IN ITALY and enjoyed the flow of her reconstructed a shabby old treasure of a house there and her inimitable conversation about how to enjoy the special qualities of Tuscany, seeing this book adapted into a film seemed a reasonable step. After seeing the film and finding it so completely unrelated to Mayes' book - using it more life a stage on which to create a lot of 'audience pleasing subplots' - this viewer passed on writing a review. Seeing the film again, years later, without any expectations to meet, was a pleasant surprise. Get past the Audrey Wells superimposed episodes of Sandra Oh and her baby, of the love affair gone awry, and the Fellini reenactment etc and the film has some charm. Diane Lane tries her best to make us consider this little story a transformation event and in many cases ti works. But not always in the manner in which it was intended.What does come shining through are some bit parts by actors who deserve more attention and more exposure. For instance, the 'workmen' who help Lane's adapted character transform her villa into a 'home' for all manner of folk. One of the actors who plays the young Pawel, Pawel Szajda, has all the necessary qualities to bloom into a fine career - and hopefully this film will be a springboard for him. Also Lane's 'at the end of the film only' lover Ed is played by another solid newcomer - David Sutcliff. Otherwise the possibility of falling in love with beautiful Tuscany is a bit blurred with all the generated little stories that add little to the film. But then again, it IS durable - which says a lot for the many love affairs with Italy that both the book and the film started! Grady Harp, July 10",

    "review/text": "I have this movie on my short list of fairy tale / fable / suspension of disbelief movies, along with other \"some people love it / some people hate it\" films likeSerendipity,About Schmidt,Something's Gotta Give,Sideways (Widescreen Edition), andLocal Hero.These films all have one thing in common: the protagonists find themselves in situations where life hasn't turned out the way they planned, or a major \"life event\" takes something away from them, and in their own moment of lack and the inevitable pull toward self-pity, they find that the less they focus on what they lack and more on the blessings they have (usually in the form of other people in their lives), the more the their needs are met...and often on a grander scale than they'd previously imagined.In short, some times you lay down and get up to find yourself covered with ladybugs. People who have seen the film will get that reference immediately.There are a number of reasons to watch the movie, beginning with Diane Lane. She manages to bring the viewer right up to the point where they might be turned off by the whining and self-pity, and theby stop \"rooting for\" her...but she never crosses that line. She keeps her character human, and part of being human is feeling loss and disappointment. What separates the people who stay in that frame of mind from the ones who eventually prosper is a willingness to get up and keep moving, even when \"life hurts\" and you'd rather not.That's what the movie is all about. In the beginning, following her divorce, her friend Patti (the amazing Sandra Oh) tries to convince her to take a trip to Tuscany. She decides she can't, and relocates the pity party to a cramped, noisy apartment. Fortunately, she lacks a tolerance for her new environment and it's off to Tuscany we go.From that point on, there are too many spoilers, so I'll stop here. My feeling is that there are probably more people who have seen the movie and are reading the reviews to see what others think than there are people deciding if they want to watch it.In the modern, cynical world, there is a certain amount of scorn directed toward these little \"fables\" and \"life lessons.\" However, taking a moment to watch them reminds us that we are all human, we are all fragile, and we all can make a simple decision to do the best we can with what we have, and to always give thanks for what we've got.",

To those who had higher expectations for this film, it's common knowledge that book-to-big screen adaptations are NEVER as stimulating (or as accurate) as the book. However, as a movie in itself, Under The Tuscan Sun is charming, and manages to be both predictable and unpredictable at the same time. Also, as many others have said, the scenery is amazing, and will have you twitching in your socks to hop a plane straight to Italy. This is a movie for comedy/romance lovers without too much cheese (I personally can't stand romantic comedies but I find this one of my only exceptions). I absolutely recommend this film to all open-minded people who can step down from their elitist platforms while they watch and appreciate this film for what it is: a cute and well-made mainstream Diane Lane film. And if Frances Mayes can say on the DVD's featurette that she approves this adaptation of her novel, so should everyone else.",

There was a guy sitting behind and and to the left (Frances' right) of Frances in the church during the wedding scene at movie's end. He was SO MUCH better looking than Signor Bova. That guy should have been Marcello.The movie is an unrealistic fantasy for those who want to escape reality for two hours. It's not a great movie, but very enjoyable nonetheless. I especially liked the tribute to the fountain scene in \"La dolce vita\". So surreal. It brought a smile to my face.As for the fascist comment that the Contessa uttered at the German couple, it was clearly included in the film for humor. People forget that fascists lived not only in Italy, but also in Germany. The Nazis were fascists.Enjoy!",

    "review/text": "The only thing that ruined my pleasure from this movie was the repeated thought \"How can she afford all this....\"? A thought that remained with me throughout the viewing. I apologize for being such a material girl but the lovely house does make you wonder. We are talking not only about the house itself whose price we understand how Frances Mayes afforded, but the everyday life who do cost a little money especially if you redo your house with such lovely furniture. It seems that Frances Mayes was very busy during the daytime (the meals she cooked seem to have taken hours to make), and only spent a few hours writing. Was that enough to afford life in Italy? I wonder. The house itself needed intense furnishing which no doubt cost money too... I assume these thoughts come to the mind of anyone watching this movie and asking himself \"why not me\"? well money seems to be one of the answers.However, casting these thoughts aside, this is indeed a movie that is a pleasure to watch, even if the storyline is a little banale and not totally credible. Indeed, the book by the same name is more detailed (and thus tedious) explaining how the long renovations came through. One picture however is worth a thousand words and watching the beautiful Italy is not like reading about it in a book.Diane Lane is lovely and beautiful and is a joy to watch. Her acting abilities (which were amazing in \"Unfaithful\") do not have a lot of \"meat\" besides several emotional outbreaks (usually over romantic issues) but she is warm and touching. Toscany however is the real star of this film with its landscape, beauty, light and people (together with all the regular cliches about the Italians... even cliches have some truth in them). What remains from this movie is not the story line but a burning desire to travel to Italy.",

It is more a story of character development that takes place on an adventure.As for all the comments regarding political correctness with the &quot;token&quot; Asian best friend, let me tell you...that is more than a bit insulting. Granted, Hollywood has done that with certain minorities before, but this best friend hardly filled any stereotype. And in fact, the reason Hollywood places those &quot;token&quot; minorities in is because it makes the screen more INTERESTING and DIVERSE! Not to mention REALISTIC! The entirety of America is not all white, and sometimes putting a person of color in a film does add some spark and dimension to the film.Not to mention, this particular actress held her own, exuded her own personality altogether, and made the film better.As for taking liberties with the book...the beginning of the movie admits to fabricating some of the information. And if you want to talk about taking liberties with a translation from book to film, take a look at the film Chocolat.",

    "review/text": "If you love Italy then go see this movie. If you like real and intelligent characters then go see this movie. If you hate romantic comedies then go see this movie.I am not a huge fan of the romantic comedy genre. More often than not, a romantic comedy is nothing more than a few good looking people thrown together and saddled with a lousy script. That's not to say that there aren't notable exceptions, but for the most part they suck. Based on the previews for this movie, I didn't have high hopes, however I did receive a free pass to watch a sneak preview for the movie, so how could I say no?Having not read the book, I really didn't know what to expect. Let me tell you it was a pleasant surprise. For starters, Diane Lane was the perfect choice for the lead character Frances Mayes. She brings a natural reality to the character, instead of the saccharin sweet typically found in a romantic comedy. Diane instantly makes you feel like you know this woman. She's your neighbor, or someone you work with. In the scene after she learns of her husband's infidelities, she looks horrible - exactly like you'd expect like a woman would look after traumatic news. Of course Diane Lane is a very beautiful woman and as the movie progresses that becomes more and more apparent. Luckily Diane is more than just a pretty face and her performance is stellar. The movie as a whole is understated, letting things play out instead of spelling everything out and Diane provides a wonderful tapestry for you to see what is happening to her. Her reactions tell you more than pithy dialog ever could and as a result you end up taking the journey with her.As much as I loved Diane Lane in this movie, she is surrounded by an incredible supporting cast. Sandra Oh, as the best friend, delivers an authentic performance. Instead of the typical \"funny sidekick\" so often played by those in the role of best friend, she's down to earth and real. Raoul Bova plays the Italian lover and should make most women weak in the knees, but I found Vincent Riotta, the real estate agent, to be a much richer character. And speaking of rich characters, Lindsay Duncan plays a wonderful eccentric as Katherine who almost serves as a fairy godmother.Although the acting is surpurb, what brings it all together are the talents of Audrey Wells who serves as the screenplay writer, director and producer. Most of Audrey's background has been in writing. This is only her second film as a director, yet you wouldn't know it by watching the film. Clearly Ms. Wells has a love of Italy and a love of the novel and all of that shows on the screen. She filmed in the cities that are represented and she hired actors that are the nationality in which they play and the age in which they should be. The entire films shines with authenticity and coupled with wonderful performances and directing, Audrey has redefined the romantic comedy.This movie was refreshing, witty, poetic, dramatic and rich with characters that you not only like, but identify with. It was such a breath of fresh air that I'm ready to see it again and again. This film is definitely going into my DVD collection.",

    "review/text": "Ghastly chick flic riddled with clich&eacute;s. Like Oscar Wilde's comment about Dickens, \"One would have to have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing.\" The endless assault to the senses of repetitive themes of a woman scorned and a new life blossoming kept me between the Scylla and Charybdis of vomiting and hysterics. When we watched it, my wife repeatedly hit me over the head with her \"Elle\" magazine.Yet, this film has broad appeal for those middle aged men like me who've loved Diane Lane since \"A Little Romance,\" and like the outdoors and travel. The shots of Tuscany and the coast are beautiful, and the house around which most of the action takes place is gorgeous, and so of those chick flics for which we occasionally are obliged to sit through with our amante, this one is the least offensive.The first clich&eacute;: Frances Mayes (Diane Lane) has a perfect balanced life, with a wonderful happy home, all suddenly shattered by that snake-in-the-pants husband. Of course, the divorce settlement is all in *his* favor (\"isn't that always the way, girl!?\").Next clich&eacute;: a gaggle of sympathetic but ultimately feckless friends with shadows of divided loyalties. Of course, the most sympathetic one is gay (you go, girlfriend!).I won't belabor the \"change of scene\" clich&eacute;, since, like \"The Simpson's\" Millhouse, by this time I wanted to scream \"when are we going to get to the fireworks factory?\" off to Tuscany: on a crummy bus!Next, an impulsive irrational decision (you go girl!) to buy a ruin of a house, not possibly made from a hormone imbalance or deeply unresolved issues without adequate coping mechanisms. No. This is feminine intuition at work. (Girl power!)In the town nearby, Frances meets Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a `free spirited\" English woman (or mad lithium deprived manic depressive?) in her early 60s, who has erected her life as a cartoon of herself in devotion to an encounter in her youth with Fellini. It isn't tragic that she's done nothing with her life after building it on the shallow sands of glance with pseudo-intellectual \"greatness,\" it is s*i*g*n*i*f*i*c*a*n*t. Most of her dialogue consists of Katherine tediously lecturing Frances about sex, of which Frances improbably manages to get plenty of boy-toy supply, albeit short-lived (\"snake in the pants men again! Boooo Hisssssss!\"). One wonders why director Audrey Wells didn't cast the corpse of Ruth Gordon in this part. For the rest of the film I kept looking around for Bud Cort to drive up to the house in his hearse Jaguar to conclude the subplot by giving Katherine a good \"free spirited\" rogering and a happily ever after.Then there is the ironic cupid clich&eacute;: Frances's own love life (for which the house serves as metaphor) is being reconstructed from a ruin, yet she must play both Cupid and Hera to a younger couple. Yet the voice of Zelda comes in here too, \"Rich girls don't marry poor boys\" and Juliet is the daughter of forbidding Italian papa, and Romeo is a Polish blue collar dolt without family or purse.Did we keep getting beaten over the head with how important \"family\" is in the new place Frances has impulsively settled? We all know single-women without family end up mad (like Katherine). Angry, Juno (Frances) seeks a magic flower that is suppose to allow fertilization without a man (or embarks on a series of disastrous affairs). Finding the rare flower (her home, Bramasole) Juno (Frances) uses it to become pregnant and gives birth to Mars (additional subplot conflicts, including her own).And so, \"Family\" finally does resolves the plot, and Frances (Juno) hosts the wedding of our young lovers at her now restored home (Olympus). Our hero enters stage left (right). He has come from afar to pay homage (worship) the fair Frances (\"I heard the great writer I admire....\"), whom he has venerated from afar at strange temples (grad school).And here is our ending: The cast aside Juno has been through hell, is given new transformation as Proserpina, and at the shadow of her lover rises from the flower'd bower and becomes Venus once again, beautiful, loved, and admired for her mind and body and soul. The curtain falls, and the perfect female illusion of a perfect man without flaws living together in a golden flower strewn paradise of long mornings and playful equality (no, not really equal, he worships her *intellectual* superiority), is once again given arc and confirmation.The end.My wife was crying and I giggled myself to sleep.",

The ideas of letting go of our guilt and other ugly things that tie us to worldly possessions, and just going out on a limb to experience a new life - is a romantic and exciting idea. Who wouldn't want to move to someplace as beautiful as Tuscany and to meet characters that truly understand the meaning of Life and letting our inner spirits thrive. This movie is not boring, and is just a wonderful story depicting how amazing life can be, if you only stop and appreciate the wonders of it.",

As a worker bee who enjoys his job, I would have a hard time renouncing my home and buying a villa in Tuscany. That being said, when we got to that part of the movie, I did say: &quot;Wouldn't that be fun for a while...&quot;.I agree with those who say that this isn't a masterpiece. It isn't the Godfather, it isn't Gone with the Wind, and it isn't Lawrence of Arabia. If you want those, go buy them. If you want a romantic movie that they will show on TNT someday, and you don't want it to take place in New York, this isn't a bad choice.I've been to Italy, I watch Molto Mario, and I thought that this movie was pretty.

As the beautiful villa is repaired, so is Francis' soul. This film is about friends, relationships, love and healing. Diane Lane is absolutely wonderful, such a great actress.

I've been back several times since. I can't help it. The country and the people draw me back. I can relate to Mayes need for a home there. When I first heard of a movie being made based on the book, I anxiously awaited its release. Even knowing that there would be creative license used to relate the book to film, I was never worried about the outcome. I knew it would be a beautiful film. I'm not disappointed.Some of the situations and set up have changed to suit the film format, but these were all done well. What remains is the essence of the book. The essence of Italy. How it makes you fall in love with history. How it makes you fall in love with simple and flavorful food. How it makes you fall in love with the beautiful Italian people. How it makes you fall in love with the beautiful countryside and rolling hills filled with olives and grapes.They've attached a simple story line to the movie, but its roots go much deeper. Watch it for the good romantic movie that it is, but look closer. Listen to the words. See the people, old and young that move through the story. Look at the scenery. It really does look like that. Everywhere. Read the book and go see the movie again. I am.",

Mayes gave writer-director Audrey Wells total permission to create a plot where the original book had none; while Wells plays fast and free with the details of Mayes' life (for example, Mayes already had a second husband when she bought Bramasole), Mayes certainly doesn't seem to mind, so we shouldn't either. Wells' plot has a lot of humor, a little heartbreak, a wisecracking lesbian best friend (Sandra Oh), a flamboyant English actress (Lindsay Duncan), an enigmatic old man (Mario Monicelli), and a pair of incredibly adorable teenage lovers, along with a childbirth, fields of glowing sunflowers and many sumptuous Italian meals. Basically, \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is a charming, pretty movie about charming, pretty people doing charming, pretty things. That doesn't make a masterpiece, but it does make an extremely pleasant way to pass two hours. (Note: Lindsay Duncan also appeared in the TV version of \"A Year in Provence.\" Wouldn't you LOVE to have her agent?)",

The first time I saw this film, I found it to be a somewhat mediocre mid-life crisis story (which I can't really appreciate, being only 25). Now, though, it's one of my all-time favorite films.Most of this is owed to Diane Lane and the stunning scenery of Italy, which seems itself a character in the film. There's something extraordinary about watching a person overcome her own total destruction, as Frances does. Furthermore, while I generally hate \"journey of self-discovery\" movies, this one works simply because it recognizes two truths: no one can love you if you can't love yourself, and loving others is the expression of that self-love. When Frances is selfish, it doesn't work out. When she's giving, all her dreams come true. Cheesy, maybe, but fantastic.The music is excellent, and the pacing highly appropriate. Finally, on a more shallow note, there are a lot of hot men in this movie. Pawel in particular is well worth at least one viewing of the movie for the ladies!",

    "review/text": "The first time I watched Under the Tuscan Sun, my high school boyfriend had broken up with me. It was one of those times when a young girl realizes she's lost her so-called true love. (I'm better off without him, all these years later.) This movie helped my mood improve tenfold. I adore Diane Lane's character and her ability to overcome troubles at home and find a brand new, more fulfilling life in Italy. I was inspired by this film and opted to study abroad in Tuscany during college to discover, for myself, all the beauty Italy truly has to offer. Ever since I was introduced to Under the Tuscan Sun, I have always turned to this film to brighten my mood and pick me up when I'm down. It's my go to for any bad day or argument with a loved one. I hope this review helps and this film could be someone else's pick me up in the same way that it is mine.",

Sadly, there is infidelity, greed, fornication, lesbians who are lacking in their 'great love' commitment . . .why are we not surprised. . .but in each of these situations there is a moral teaching at the finish line. There are cads, both American and Italian, but there are wonderful men who can be trusted. There are women who hold on to life for all they are worth!The scenery will more than take your breath away - you will actually stop breathing! The house! The house! It is incredible. You will want to buy the house! You will love the workmen! You will want to hire the workmen! The food! The food! You will want Italian food for the rest of your life. Get out the pasta pot!Is it enough for me to say that I saw Under the Tuscan Sun opening day as a 'chick-flick' with a friend then called my husband, paid twice, and sat though the next showing?

This film depends on the performance of Diane Lane (as Mayes), who, even though she can manage to look stunning in a ratty t-shirt, still comes off as down to earth and approachable, someone who seems to be inviting you into her life. That's what she does in this film. After she discovers her husband is cheating on her, Frances (Lane) falters but then accepts a ticket to Tuscany from one of her gay friends. Admittedly, the trajectory from there is predicatable--she rennovates a Tuscan villa while at the same time rennovating her life, which includes meeting a new man. But the film is more about Frances' self-discovery, experiencing life, and getting her own inner life back on track. The film is also beautifully shot--how could it not be beautiful if the location is Tuscany? I would recommend this one--a lovely film!",

    "review/text": "With women occupying an ever increasing role in the workplace, as well as raising children on their own following divorces, Hollywood has turned away from the old pattern of all too often showcasing beautiful women as ornaments from handsome hunks, in short sex symbols without much to do beyond making their male co-stars happy.Fortunately the trend has changed and stars like Diane Lane have plenty of meat and bones in their roles. Such is the case in Under the Tuscan Sun. The story begins with San Francisco writer and book reviewer Lane reeling under the tragedy of divorce.Lane is provided with a free tour to Tuscany by a lesbian friend who bypasses the trip she purchased to give birth via in vitro fertilization. Lane bolts the gay tour in beautiful Tuscany, where she experiences an epiphany. She becomes enchanted and eventually buys an old house, with a reclamation project following, in the course of which she gets acquainted with the people and the area.Eventually Lane's lesbian friend turns up in Tuscany with a new baby after her gay relationship ends. In addition to this adjustment, Lane finds herself awakening in the sexual realm. An experience with a handsome young man from the area prompts her to see herself as never before.Lane's character arc in the film is significant as she sees herself in her new setting as never before. The relationship with the handsome young local has a strong bearing in bringing her out and creating a more developed woman. By the film's end she has enhanced her understanding of life and become more mature. She is then able to face life in a new way, having thrown off the shackles of the past.",

As it turns out, the story is a story of love, romantic love included of course, but also about the love of friends and family. The story centers around Frances, who after a bitter divorce, ends up in Italy and becomes drawn to an Italian villa that is a bit of a fixer-upper. On a whim, she buys the place and with a motley crew of workers, begins to restore the home. Slowly she begins to really live again, meeting kind neighbors and villagers and eventually finding romance. Diane Lane does a great job as Frances and the supporting cast does well with their roles too. I definitely plan to buy this on dvd.",

This is not your tipical 'chick flick' as so many have labled it. It's a drama about finding the stregth inside to move on and live a better life. To give yourself credit where credit is due and to take chances even when your afraid. Let fate step in and roll with the punches. What is so great about this film is that as you watch you see how Frances grows with each obsticle that befalls her. You see Frances (Lane) is going through a divorce because her husband left her for a younger woman. Her husband ends up buying the house from her and after being urged to take her lesbian friends gay tour of Italy she uses the money she gained from the sale of her house to purchase a villa in Tuscany. From that point on it's one journey after another, from the reconstruction of her home to falling in love all over again, but it will not end like you'd assume so don't get too depressed thinking this is another love story. It's far from it. THis is a story about finding yourself, not about finding a man.",

Diane Lane's performance, in my opinion, was one of the best I've seen in a film this year. It's rare for me to enjoy a movie, especially one that is, in places, narrated but it was truly a great movie to watch. It takes place in Italy and as I recall most of the production crew was Italian, which I thought was a very good idea for who knows Italy better than the people who live there? The cast was an interesting array of talented men and women. I especially liked Sandra Oh as Patti and Lindsay Duncan as Katherine. The script was my favourite part of the entire film although the setting was beautiful and the cast well chosen. I think the only thing that I didn't like about it was that I couldn't connect with it personally, which says absolutely nothing about the movie. When it comes right down to it, I would have to say that I would recommend this movie to just about anyone.",

Disgruntled in San Francisco, she finds that her friend's insistence that she take a trip to Tuscany is a blessing in disguise. But Frances doesn't just stay for a touristy trip-she impulsively falls in love with a old villa and thus begins her life in Italy. This new life, it turns out, is the best thing Frances could have. In a quiet, gradual way she begins to deal with her divorce and finds lessons, friends, love, and a beautiful new existence.I didn't expect much from &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun.&quot; It sounded fairly dippy and a bit too cute. I was sure it would be one of those movies that tries maniacally hard to tug at your heartstrings and becomes intolerable for that reason. But, wonder of wonders, it wasn't!Somehow, Diane Lane captured her character perfectly. Frances (or Francesca, as she was known in Italy) seemed like someone to root for. She didn't usually look or dress like a movie star-much of the time in the movie she wore old flannel shirts and a scraggly ponytail-and reacted to her new life and friends as we ourselves might. Frances alternately blunders, rejoices, makes unwise romantic decisions, yet somehow comes out right. No matter what the film moment, Lane knew what to deliver, and this helped the film move along naturally and smoothly.I also enjoyed the somewhat unpredictable nature of this movie. Yes, I knew from the start that things were going to end up somewhat happily at the end, but really didn't know how. And that was one of the big reasons why I liked &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun.&quot; Its rambling pace just seemed so natural, and the fact that Frances's life takes quirky little dips and dives makes the movie all the better. You really &quot;sink into&quot; the film, and watching the lives of Frances and her friends change feels interesting, realistic, and fun. Another aspect of the plot that I greatly enjoyed was that Frances's love life was NOT picture perfect! She seemed so much more likeable then. (Will say no more about this, as do not want to spoil plot).No, &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; is nothing that will win an Academy Award. But it's warm, pleasurable, and the next best thing to an Italian vacation.",

I found truth in each character and in myself the ability to empathize freely with each one.The director/writer/everything created a tour de force opportunity for every actor in this film and I believed each one of them.Just for myself- special thanks to Sandra Oh from a fellow 2nd generation Korean.Aloha and enjoy the warm sun of this movie. It shines on anyone who would step out of the shade.",

    "review/text": "Despite so many negative reviews, I actually found the movie charming and intelligent. The character of Francis is one of hope, disappointment, independence, and fortitude.After a painful divorce, Francis takes a trip to Tuscany via a Gay tour group (trip was a gift from her best friend, Patty, who is a lesbian expecting a baby)and while in her travels, impulsively purchases a villa in the village of Cortona. The place needs a lot of work, but Francis accepts that she just can't return to the US and trudges on to fix up her new home.During the course of finding herself in a foreign country, Francis also wants a second chance at love. The movie introduces several possible men into the story and allows us to question if \"this guy is the one\". Francis eventually meets a man while in Rome named Marcello (played very handsome by Raoul Bova)and this affair ignites the passions and hopefulness that Francis has been lacking for so long.The affair with Marcello predictably ends and now Francis is caught up with the birth of Patty's baby and the budding love affair between a neighbor's daughter and one of the workmen she has hired to do home renovations.The ending is unique. The dreams that Francis originally wanted for her life is not exactly what she had hoped for. Ultimately, what she ended up with is a life far better!Besides the stereotypical 'Chick-flick\" mentality, the movie has real life lessons and points to us that sometimes slowing down and appreciating what really matters in life is what makes us happy - love, family, good food, good friends, and hope!",

    "review/text": "I am the ideal demographic for a chick flick. \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is an insult to the international sisterhood of chick flick fans.The only way the filmmakers could have made this movie more stupid, more saccharine, more pandering to the lowest common denominator, is if they including a heartwarming, tearjerking, \"Terms of Endearment\" style death by beautiful movie disease.The Studly Hunk who falls into the Over-Forty Heroine's lap is just so ... airbrushed into unreality. How could anyone be turned on by a man who bears no relation to reality? Don't answer that. I don't want to know. Anyway, this is supposed to be a chick flick, not Sci Fi.The lead is a woman wounded by her ex-husband, lost chances, and the spectre of a wintry future. Diane Lane has a body a 20 year old would envy. She lacks gravitas. I couldn't feel for her plight. It's just not there on the ravaged face, the drooping body; she's too aerobicized and perky.\"Tuscan Sun\" is as cluttered with gizmos girls are supposed to gush over as a Barbie doll house. There are swooning, adorable Polaks, goofy young lovers, a pregnant lesbian best friend.There are close-ups of yummy Italian food and unbelievably adorable people having big dinner parties. Everyone is adorable. Even grandma, with her internet love affair with a minor. It's so cute you really wish that at least one of the characters were serial killer.Everyone has tons of money and can fly between San Francisco to Italy without a moment's care. Frances, the lead character, lives a life completely divorced from normal monetary concerns. This sounds like a fantasy but it comes across as creepy. \"Does this woman ever work? Does money mean anything to her?\" These questions become so annoying, and distasteful, that you are taken out of the movie.For a movie that got similar themes very right, check out David Lean's 1955 \"Summertime,\" starring Katharine Hepburn and Rosano Brazzi. You love their onscreen romance, but you see that she is imperfect, and he is, too. \"Summertime\" is just as visually beautiful as \"Tuscan Sun,\" but it provides an artistic experience that \"Tuscan Sun\" can't even aspire to.I didn't much like this movie but I did like the actor playing Martini, the realtor who helped Diane Lane with so many things, including -- paging Dr. Freud -- a snake she could not find in her bedroom.There was a real chemistry between the two. He wasn't the most handsome man in the movie, or the most sexually dynamic, but he was the one, I think, that most viewers probably wanted to see her end up with.He was married. But this is a movie. You have two characters with such great chemistry; you could make his wife a harridan, or a lesbian -- not enough Italian lesbian movie characters out there -- or maybe she received a vocation from God and entered a convent. One that doesn't allow husbands.",

    "review/text": "The sun is shining in Italy, where you can find a new life. That's all that 'Under the Tuscan Sun' shows. If you still want to find another reason to see it, that's Diane Lane, whose delightful acting as American writer 'Frances' deserves every praise bestowed on this light-weight film.Again I say, the plot is very slim, too slim to hold the weight of the nearly 2 hour film. Frances, newly divorced, buys an old house in a small villa in Tuscany, in which she finds s new way of life, or new way of looking at that.So, she finds a new love in hunky Italian Marcello (Raoul Rova); she finds a new family in the kind-hearted neighbors; she even helps an Italian girl and a Polish boy vow the eternal love (which, ironically she finds, is hard to find). Everything is put in a right place; only that in the fashion of popular romance (and the film is based on the book of the same title by 'Frances' Mayes ... see that?).In fact there is nothing wrong with the film, except that it was done with many cliched techniques -- broken house which represents life, the best friend (Sandra Oh) who is lesbian, and all the Italian boys who never misses the chance to whisper the words of love to the girls. If you are likeky to be irritated with these unoriginality, stay away from 'Tuscan Sun.' As for me, I just pretended that I didn't see them at all.But Dinae Lane. She is so delightful that you may (just 'may') forgive and forget any cloying emotions or banal characters. She even jumps around on the bed, wearing only black underwear, just like Brittney Spears did in 'Crossrards.' You cannot hate her for doing that.See for beautiful Diane Lane, or beautiful Tuscan scenery, and forget about the plot. Three star for them (two for Ms. Lane).",

I am not normally a huge fan of non-fiction, but the book turned that around for me and inspired me to read more of it. I banned the movie in protest, but unfortunately I was staying with family and they rented it. What a disgusting insult to one of the most incredible books I have experienced. The richness of this book matched any fiction book I have ever read. I am insulted as a movie goer that they thought I would need the simpering whining \"heroine\", The stereotypical lesbians (not that I have anything against lesbians), the MARRIED man. Didn't her husband leave her for another woman? I honestly can say that I don't even think I would have liked this if I hadn't read the book, as opposed to The Bourne Identity, Supremecy (two other Hollywood slayings). Go ahead, use your marketing statistics and change the film, but do the readers of the book and its author, the graciousness of giving it another title. I was so offended at Diane Lane's picture gracing the cover of the later additions of this book. So many people will miss out on an incredible journey in an incredible book because of this tripe movie. I hope that Frances Mayes is disappointed that she ever sold the rights.",

Simply breath-taking, but don't miss the &quot;moral&quot; of the story. It's so simple and yet so true and poinient! Yes, many awful things happen to Diane Lane's character, but the point of it all is that she comes out on top! She goes through the terrible relationship with her husband, the Italian... but then she spends time by herself and she finds out who SHE TRULY IS and feels GREAT about herself WITHOUT having a man, and THEN a love interest shows up at the end (although it's not implicatly said, he is her &quot;true love&quot;). The moral: &quot;You can not truly love someone else until you love youself.&quot; So true, so true. And this movie did a FABULOUS job of illustrating it.&quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; is truly a gorgeous, feel-good, inspiring, uplifting, beautiful film! It will be a great addition to my DVD collection. :-)",

DIANE LANE plays Frances Mayes, a woman who is recovering from a tragic divorce and depression. On a whim she goes to Tuscany and starts to rebuild her life. The story doesn't sound original but the makers have avoided the cliches and done a very nice job in making the film feel different and yet engrossing. It is entertainment at it's best, and it has amazing scenery and a winning perfomance by all of the actors in the funny and quirky supporting roles. It is funny and quite sexy in places and especially DIANE LANE is wonderful in this film. Excellent. 5 stars!",

So smug and enraptured with its Childlike Brilliance and Use of Symbols.The dialog is so flat footed, they should have had a podiatrist on the set--and every character is a cliche of a cliche of a stereotype. Diane Lane has four facial expressions, employed in turn: bravely hurt, bemused, cutely stammering, and I forget the other. My friend and I were hooting with laughter as we predicted the next plot surprise.But another reviewer kindly supplied the adjective I was groping for as gratefully shut down the TV: \"godawful.\" No wonder guys think we're aliens.PS.

Once there, she falls in love with the place, buys a broken-down villa, and proceeds to merrily fix it up, with the help of all the usual village stereotypes. She is longing for love and finds it, as well as peace and happiness.This is the quintessential chick-flick about a plucky heroine who can do anything and is surrounded by loveable characters. What separates this film from the ordinary romantic comedy is Diane Lane's strong screen presence and her talent; she is utterly believable as the spunky, lusty, modern woman with stars in her eyes. The exquisite location photography could well start a boom in Tuscan tourism. Heartily recommended.",

    "review/summary": "\"But the Beauty Knob Goes to Eleven . . .\"",
    "review/text": "The one thing everyone must say about Audrey Wells' \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is that it is visually stunning. Restraint is completely abandoned in this Oprah-ready tale of a beautiful divorcee (Diane Lane) \"finding herself\" in the postcard-perfect Tuscan hillside. Yes, this is a movie for those who sprinkle extra sugar on their cotton candy.This is the kind of movie that won't give you a gorgeous shot of an old church -- rather, we'll give you a gorgeous shot of an old church on a picturesque Tuscan hillside as the camera peeks over a bank of photogenic sunflowers in full bloom. Not content to show the gorgeous Diane Lane exchanging sweet nothings with a gorgeous Italian hunk on a gorgeous Italian beach, Ms. Wells feels obliged to throw a kitten -- yes, a freaking kitten -- into the scene for no reason other than to send the cuteness scale over the top.Ms. Lane stars in this ode to returning to basics - it is revealing that noboby I've talked to about the movie knows her character's name. In a plot device straight out of a gripe session on \"The View,\" Ms. Lane gets divorced by her philandering husband -- and thanks to California's heartless divorce laws, she ends up living in the divorcee's flat while he keeps the posh San Francisco house. Massive depression ensues, as evidenced by Ms. Lane's furrowed brow. Let's just say that the stellar acting job Diane Lane gave us in \"Unfaithful\" is nowhere to be found in \"Tuscan Sun.\"Ms. Lane's stereotypically supportive lipstick lesbian friends try to buck up her spirits by sending her on a trip to Tuscany -- but it's a gay trip, get it! Actually, the gay tour offers one of the movie's few genuine laughs with its appellation, \"Gay and Away!\" Diane spots a \"for sale\" sign on a picturesque Tuscan villa and, after some hapless negotiating and some timely bird crap, she buys it.We then enter a long series of scenes as Diane begins to restore the villa -- for those of you who were perhaps wondering if there would be a delightful parallel between the rehabilitation of the villa and Ms. Lane's personal rehabilitation, you won't be surprised. Again, the movie ain't subtle. Employing a trio of lovable Polish cardboard cutouts as laborers, Diane returns \"Bramasole\" to its villa-ish glory. Naturally, after living in Tuscany for a few weeks, Ms. Lane discovers that she has already mastered Tuscan cuisine, and the movie gives us several shots of her presenting her friends and laborers with meals that could be on the cover of a Tuscan cookbook. Unfortunately, \"Tuscan Sun\" is not that interested in food beyond its photogenics -- those looking for another \"Big Night\" will be horribly disappointed.Of course, Ms. Lane must find her self romantically involved. To say this aspect of the story is handled poorly is an understatement. Her realtor achieves a cinematic first -- he offers to sleep with Diane while simultaneously confirming his devotion to his wife. And just about when the audience is expecting Diane to find herself a man, lo and behold she runs into a charming soul who looks like a champion Italian tennis player.Several other sub-plots are handled in similarly skin-deep fashion. This is the kind of movie that doesn't interject a serious love interest for Ms. Lane until the last five minutes, and he really only gets about two or three lines of dialogue . . . but visually the movie tells you that he is the one to complete our heroine.All in all, \"Tuscan Sun\" is an inoffensive, light-hearted, beautiful romp through nonsense. To borrow a Shakespearean title, \"Much Ado About Nothing\" completely fits. That being said, the movie can play a role if you find yourself completely depressed (or lacking in travel plans) -- Tuscany is a wonderful tonic. At least the movie got that right, if nothing else.The DVD has virtually no extras to recommend it.",

When I first heard of a movie being made based on the book, I anxiously awaited its release. Even knowing that there would be creative license used to relate the book to film, I was never worried about the outcome. I knew it would be a beautiful film. I'm not disappointed.Some of the situations and set up have changed to suit the film format, but these were all done well. What remains is the essence of the book. The essence of Italy. How it makes you fall in love with history. How it makes you fall in love with simple and flavorful food. How it makes you fall in love with the beautiful Italian people. How it makes you fall in love with the beautiful countryside and rolling hills filled with olives and grapes.They&#65533;ve attached a simple story line to the movie, but its roots go much deeper. Watch it for the good romantic movie that it is, but look closer. Listen to the words. See the people, old and young that move through the story. Look at the scenery. It really does look like that.

Some call this genre \"chick flicks\"--so be it.The story is pure, simple fluff, and not even original at that.

Is it perfectly believable? Yes! As she sets out to save the villa from utter ruin and turn it into a liveable residence, she finds herself involved with a crazy group of Polish emigrants, who not only speak poor English, but poor Italian as well. They have been hired to remodel the villa.Then there's a crazy but fabulous real estate woman who fancies herself a character in a Fellini movie--and then some. Our heroine has definitely bitten off more than she can chew, but at least she doesn't have much time to think of the cad back home who dumped her. So does she find true love and live happily ever after?

When she's happy she looks like she just did. Then you have the fact that nothing that happens in the movie is realistic at all -- except, if someone like Cameron Diaz were in the title role, we'd probably not care and even enjoy it. I feel used and cheap after being duped into watching this movie and I'm no longer going to waste my time on DL's films. She doesn't deliver. If she plays a Black Widow, I'll watch.

When her friend offers her a ticket to tour romantic Tuscany, in an attempt to get her mind off her troubles, Frances decides to make the trip permanent. She buys a villa, hires people to help her fix it up, and looks for love all over again. This movie is all about love, but not necessarily love for Frances. It's about young love between a Polish worker and a teenage Italian girl; it's about love between a mother and her baby daughter; and it's about the love an old man has, which Frances is never really able to figure out.While the subplots and storylines help tell a general theme as Frances tries to discover whether or not love really does exist, it wasn't enough to hold my interest. You keep waiting for something, anything, to happen, but it really doesn't. As I said, it's not a bad movie, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you want a movie purely for the beautiful scenes of Tuscany.",

    "review/text": "The scenery was beautiful! The parts about the renovation of the villa were both interesting and funny! Diane Lane is luminous in the role of Frances!Okay, now that I have that out of the way, let me tell you what I really think -- this movie was about as deep as a raindrop. It couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a travel log or a two-hankie chick flick.It really goaded me that ''Frances'', in order to recover from the heartbreak of divorce, discerned that the only thing she really needed to do in order to repair the damage to her poor heart was have sex with some guy she barely knew. It wasn't about renovating the villa; it wasn't about making friends with her new neighbors; it wasn't even about being the rock-in-a-storm buddy for her pregnant lesbian friend -- it was MOSTLY about attracting a man long enough to have sex with him. \"Yes! Yes! I've still GOT IT!\" she announces ecstatically to the picture of the Blessed Virgin Mary that decorates her bed. As if the BVM should be expected to warmly congratulate Frances on her promiscuity.I would have admired \"Frances\" and the screenwriters if the renovation of the house could have served as a metaphor by taking what was old and crumbling and worn out (Frances' life with her unfaithful ex) and turning it, despite its flaws, into something improved and lovely, with all the cracks and flaws seamlessly plastered into a whole piece again. It was sitting right there, waiting for them. Instead, what we as the viewers got was just another sad little tale about how a woman ain't nothin' if she ain't got herself a man, even if she has friends who love her and an Italian villa to drool over.",

    "review/text": "God, how I wanted to like this movie! I mean...Diane Lane, the breath-taking Tuscany countryside and a gorgeous, though extremely run down, villa. Whats not to like? Unfortunately plenty.Don't misunderstand me though. The idea of watching Diane Lane for two hours is something that, for the most part, I find enjoyable, if not entertaining as well but... For the most part stooping to the usual Hollywood cliche's by making our heroine a perennial victim ( cheating hubby AND uncaring lover! ) is not only transparent and terribly obvious but almost patronizing as well. Why is it that Hollywood feels the need to make women total victims of lousy husbands/boyfriends in a pathological desire to cast the films star as innocent and therefore extremely likable? And sadly that's just the beginning of the film that I had originally thought was to be a humorous yet sensitive movie concerning a womans growth and bid for independence. But it was not to be. Cliche's abound and during my initial viewing I almost cringed at dialogue that was less then sterling and a story line that was almost little more then a 'Lifetime Channel for Women' movie of the week.After our heroine decides to purchase the 'fixer-upper' of her dreams she moves in and with all of the subtlty of a Lucille Ball/Desi Arnez sit-com finds herself in one silly situation after another. Most of those being so contrived and obvious that I could almost tell what might happen next. You know...language problems, getting hired handy men to do their jobs, nosy neighbors, blah, blah, blah. No doubt you get the idea. All the while Ms. Lane makes friends with some of those wacky locals ( why are locals in these types of films always silly and full of character? ). Sadly, the cliche's truly never stop. And if it wasn't for the truly beautiful setting and stunning landscapes I probably would have given up but that may be this films only saving grace.Nevertheless, of course Ms. Lane meets a gentleman who she seems smitten with and with all of the emotional maturity of an over-sexed sixteen year she old falls in love with the Italian Stallion. Though once again to be done wrong by the cad who doesn't exactly return those very same amorous feelings. Rats! Poor Diane. Just another rotten guy that has no true feelings! Also, why do people in movies such as this fall in love with all the ease of changing one's clothes? Anyway, its all so painfully obvious and juvenile I almost used the DVD as a frisbee to relieve the rotten mood that this movie had put me in. Sorry to all fans of this movie but God knows the victim mentality that permeates this film is not only over-bearing but pandering as well. I guess I was supposed to be wringing my hands all the while thinking, \" Poor, poor Diane. \"Well, of course at the very end of this...whatever you may call this umm thing, our heroine meets yet devastatingly attractive bachelor. Seems as though in this movie their falling out of the trees! Yes, all wells that ends well and perhaps Diane has found true love after all. You would have thought by this time that Ms. Lane would have learned her lesson but in true Hollywood fashion love conquers all and I suppose that the directors wanted the audience to cross their little fingers and hope that she has found that one true knight in shining armour. Thereby assuring our heroine that she will live happily ever after since in the movies no woman is ever really happy unless she has found her life-time mate. Again, sorry but the nauseating factor at this point was well past the point of anything redeeming this schlock that must cater to women who still believe in soul-mates, puppy-love and Cinderella endings.

In the same scene, the main character uses the f--- word and it sounds like it was inserted into the script simply for the shock value. Also, there's teenage (and adult) premarital sex. Overall the film has a very casual attitude about sex and shows some rather graphic scenes for a PG-13 film. It's just another attempt by Hollywood to get us all comfortable with homosexuality, promiscuity, and a general idea of \"If it feels good, do it.\" I would strongly advise against seeing this movie, especially with kids.",

So, if you have read the book, and you are thinking about seeing the movie, my advice to you is try not to expect too much. Think of the movie seperate from the book.

Her performance as a crestfallen divorcee American writer is a disappointing, she twitched and grimaced like a female Hugh Grant, using delayed reaction goggle-eyes instead of emotion.Needless scenes abound. The self-grabbing congratulatory dance she did in her bedroom after scoring with her young stud was just plain agonizing to watch. Another awful scene was when Patti came back pregnant and abandoned and lay in the bed crying. Diane Lane's face was vacant, with a fake little soap opera frown of concern on her brow and a simpering smile on her mouth. Awful, and inexcusable of the director to leave that shot in.Italian stereotypes? Truckloads:(1) Crazy old contessa who takes bird poop on the forehead of a stranger as a sign to sell her the prized villa. Okay, whatever, even though she would have gotten more money from the German couple who had first dibs.(2) Suave love-em and leave-em Romeos? All over the place. Even a romantic stud who says things like &quot;Your eyes are beautiful. I would love to swim in them&quot;.(3) Simple, good-hearted locals happy to pick your olives for you? A villageful.(4) An inane young couple whose parents don't consent to their idiotic relationship? Yes, and our American sweetheart swerves their mind in less than 5 minutes.(5) People falling from trees in the backyard. Yep.(6) Three Italian construction workers who worked for 8-9 months for almost nothing while maintaining a wonderful attitude all the time? Hmm.Whether all of this Hollywood view of countryside Italy suits your gullible palate or not, all of this is just too drawn out to retain a viewer's attention.To add a final dollop of fuel to the fire, after all these ordeals, our poor Ms. Frances ends up with a goofy-looking failed American writer anyway.

Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library.",

    "review/text": "This movie is absolutely terrible, full of stereotypes and a BIG, unromantic, time waster. A chic flick? If lesbian couples (one is pregnant by a sperm donor) being presented as normal Americana, promiscuous sex with strangers, gay tours of Italy (with lots of gay men running around at the beginning)seems romantic to you-- Then you'll love this movie. If you're a more traditional, the type that is mocked by Hollywood, then AVOID THIS MOVIE. The director seemed to be more interested in espousing her political views VS. crafting a well constructed, properly structured story. When will Hollywood figure out they are alienating a good portion of America with these liberal ideals? &lt;P(...)Can you say \"convoluted\". Can you say \"cliche\".Diane Lane looks great for a 45 year old woman.And the chunk-headed pregnant lesbian is a really obnoxious character that I think was a bad casting choice-- Particularly during the opening party scene. An unsympathetic character to say the least. The trembling construction guy was much more endearing.Buy the film with Keanu Reeves picking grapes in Italy instead-- It's a lot better!",

She's an attractive lady who plays a jilted novelist trying to escape a failed marriage by retreating to the Tuscany beauty in Italy. The filming is absolutely breathtaking. The colorful little Italian villas, the flowering sunflowers and olive trees. The ancient artifices along the Italian coastal villages. Beautiful.The story (again, I haven't read the book) was sound, too: a woman trying to rebuild her life by buying and rebuilding a home in Tuscany. She finds out that everything she needs, everything she's hoped for, comes true thanks to this little home and her healing spirit.So many people have given this film a \"poor\" rating, and I've noticed that most of them have been fans of the novel. But if you haven't read the novel, and want to see some excellent cinematography and a good story, pick up this movie and enjoy. You won't be disappointed.",

In Italy she purchases a villa and decides to fix it up.Big problems with this film include the fairy tale aspect. First that the Italians would love Francesca and take her in as one of their own. I feel bad for the real Tuscany and the influx of Americans that will soon go there. I didn't like the young lovers.. I agreed with the father. They are young and stupid and shouldn't have gotten married.I think some reviewers miss the point of the sexy Italian that Franceca beds. In the end she learns that sex does not make her \"have it\" and that thinking might be exactly the problem. Of course, the end betrays this lesson when she finds another love interest. Don't you know, you must have a man in this world to be complete?My favorite part was the compassionate married man who befriends Francesca. I loved the idea that there was a good man in the story and so little films ever provide a man who is not a love interest. Or if they do the \"good men\" are obviously boring and incomplete. Somehow I got the idea that the film didn't mean to provide that story but the actor brought the compassion to the role.The end is insanely clunky. When I saw the love interest come I actually turned the movie off so as to not ruin the rest of the movie.One big problem for me was did Francesca and her gay friend have no family? How could both just up and run off to Italy? Again more of fantasy. Tons of plot holes and bizzare lessons that seem to make no sense.That said it is an entertaining movie if you approach it as not 100% in reality.",

Tuscany is a countryside that got me hooked the first time I saw it appearing in front of my train window, and it is the same with the movie. So, I could empathize, seeing the same happening to &quot;Frances&quot; (Diane Lane) when she sees Tuscany and decides to buy a house and stay. Diane Lane in one of her best roles, her face very expressive, her acting excellent.The only disappointment came when I read the book the movie was made after: in the original autobiographic story, Frances Mayes is not at all a divorcee struggling with recurring bouts of loneliness, but rather, a woman already happily attached again to a new steady boyfriend, with a fulfilled life, and full of energy for the work on their new house. The movie trailer says, the character were &quot;changed for dramatic effect&quot;. Wonder who did not like the idea that a woman could be happy again so soon, and decided it should not be shown in the movie that way ? Anyway, both are definitely worth your while, and in the book you can even find the recipes for all that great Italian cooking too.",

    "review/text": "Diane Lane delivers a warm performance as Frances, a writer/book reviewer, who finds purpose in the Tuscan countryside. Frances, suffering from the depression of a failed marriage, is urged by her pregnant friend Patti (Sandra Oh) to take her place on a tour of Italy. While at first reluctant, Frances finally accepts Patti's offer when the reality of her life in New York becomes too painful. Frances is almost immediately charmed by life in Tuscany and on impulse buys a run-down villa that she plans to restore into her personal haven. Frances, now reborn as Francesca, is hardly alone in her new country as she is befriended by her real estate agent, the mysterious over-the-top blonde woman, her crew of Polish workers, and other townspeople. But sadness still tugs at her. Only when events turn out not as she expected does she begin to accept life on its terms and not on her own.The script and direction (by Audrey Wells) give this film the pacing of an art film, where the subtle interactions and plot cannot be described as much as sensed; however, the feel-good ending has the tacked on feel of a romantic comedy, where the heroine gets what she wants, even though the comedy itself is more smile- than laugh-inducing. To the credit of the screenwriters, events don't unfold exactly the way one would expect. For instance, the old man who delivers flowers every day to a roadside shrine is never explained despite his emotional connection to Frances. The man one would think could bring Frances her much needed romance does not. And the birth of Patti's child does not make Frances feel included at all. The turns are small, quiet ones, but they provide enough conflict to keep the viewer engaged. The cinematography fails to exploit the setting, resulting in a more conventional look than one would expect.Despite its flaws, this is a sweet, low-key film. While \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" may appeal to more women than men, it does not have the syrupy romance and teary-eyed moments of most films categorized as \"chick flicks.\" A good solid film that offers nothing exceptional.",

She falls in love with the place and impulsively decides to try her luck living there after spoting a dilapidated looking villa in a small town called Cortona. She thinks she can fix it up herself, but in the end hires a handyman to help out. She starts to enjoy life again and meets a handsome local guy called Marcello.While I really liked this movie, I didn't love it. It does drag a little, but overall, it's sweet, charming, romantic and absolutely visually stunning. It really makes me want to go and visit this part of Italy. Sandra Oh has a good role in this (and her lover is played by her Grey's castmate, Kate Walsh). It is good, and I hope you'll like it. It's 113 minutes long, but it kind of goes quickly because you get caught up in the story and the beauty of Tuscany.",

However, if you prefer something of the action genre, it's not for you. I enjoyed very much. Something I noticed that dissuaded me from thinking it was perfect was their overuse of symbolism. Here's a list I've comprised of all the things they'd used to represent several miniature stories within the movie (which, in my opinion are a little too abundant):1. Looking for ladybugs, falling asleep, and finding them on you when you woke up2. The train making it through the mountains in the end3. The whole issue with the faucet not working until the end4. Frances wishing for the wedding and family and then at the end, someone ELSE gets married, and her friend has a baby (the family), and she says, \"You're right, I got everything I wanted.\"5. The elderly man finally acknowledging her.6. Finding her dream man.All of these things were left open-ended right from the get-go and everything was concluded in maybe the last two minutes. If perhaps they had stuck with maybe one or two of the powerful symbols, I think the movie would have over-all had a more powerful impact.",

    "review/summary": "Luminous Lane, Beautiful Scenery...But Then What?",
    "review/text": "It's good to see Diane Lane enjoy a career renaissance after such a promising start nearly a quarter-century ago in George Roy Hill's \"A Little Romance\", as a prepubescent American falling in love with a Parisian boy, who whisks her away to Venice under the knowing eye of Laurence Olivier. Ironically, in this most recent movie, she plays an American woman, again in Italy, but this time escaping a broken marriage to find fulfillment in a Tuscan villa she decides to buy on the spot and renovate. Leave it to Lane to make it all look reasonable as what was precocious in the earlier movie has matured into a lovely sense of self-awareness and gravity in this film. And her beauty has become even more striking over the years. She has also become accomplished in displaying several emotions concurrently, layering her characters with a complexity of feelings so that you can never quite predict what she is thinking and what she will do next. Her post-coital train ride in Adrian Lyne's \"Unfaithful\" is a great example of this hard-earned skill. And Lane needs this skill in spades as she plays a fictionalized version of Frances Mayes, the author of the book upon which this greatly altered movie is based. The character seems to be longing for something she never quite figures out, and the actress convincingly portrays this sense of want. In fact, Lane almost saves this movie but not quite.At heart, this is a patronizing romantic fantasy that feels like it was produced in another era entirely, somewhere in the mid-fifties when Lane's character would be labeled a brazen, put-upon woman tainted by divorce. I kept expecting Rosanno Brazzi to come out and say something ridiculously continental to sweep her off her feet. Instead, we get Raoul Bava, who delivers the smoldering good looks but none of the irony of his rather trite Italian lover role. Lending even more color to the soap opera atmosphere is a gallery of eccentrics with an array of international accents who serve up allegorical fables and Hallmark-card advice to the heroine - an empathetic real estate agent who seems to have a crush on Frances (a flirtation I wish the director could have explored more); the young lovers who must deal predictably with the disapproval of the girl's strict parents; the rest of the inept but dedicated renovation crew; the English free-spirit who worked with Fellini and seems to have kept up her \"la dolce vita\" character in real life; the pregnant lesbian friend abandoned by her lover. Intentionally or not, Frances seems to help set all their lives on the right path, as the picturesquely run-down old villa gradually turns into the home of her dreams and serves as a life-affirming metaphor. So many contrivances riddle the story, especially toward the end when plot threads get tied up quickly. Frances' fate is not all that satisfying to the viewer either, and you know your plot is undercooked when a minor character is introduced in the last few minutes to provide romantic salvation. In truth, I am not sure how much better this movie could have been given the base material, as the story is nothing deeper than the Harlequin romance novels you find in the checkout line at Safeway. It just seems like there are lots of personal problems floating around the plot, but I have to give credit to Lane and director Audrey Wells who jointly make the film anything but sad. Add to that the travelogue aspect with the lovely cinematography by Geoffrey Simpson of Italy's beautiful landscapes, and you can think of worse ways to spend two hours. And watch it for the true coming-of-age of Diane Lane, radiant, gifted and far more deserving of material better than this.",

I believe that this movie has a great combination of humor, romance, a little drama and some feel-good attitude.Although it might have gone a little too long for my taste (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) I believe that watching Diane Lane fixing up the house and then experiencing Tuscany is a journey that is pleasurable to watch from start to finish, if you are a woman and want to watch a movie that is going to make you feel good, this is the one...and guys if you have an anniversary coming up and you already bought her Sleepless in Seattle last year then I can recommend this one, I have a feeling she'll like it.",

    "review/text": "Now, I understand this is what is referred to by kids these days as a \"chick flick\". I am not foreign to these, as I have a wife whom I dearly love, despite her taste in movies that could only be construed as \"questionable\". I have seen a good many Jennifer Lopez movies, several starring women in the workplace who are Feisty and will Probably Fall In Love With The Wrong Guy. However, no movie has insulted the intellect of its audience in quite so drastic a fashion as the movie which is Under The Tuscan Sun.Chick Flicks go through several different stages, depending on the target age of the audience watching them. For example, movies about Ugly Pretty Girls who are somehow changed into Lovely Prom Queens while retaining their Artistic and Sensitive Personalities would be a Stage 1 Chick Flick. As these same women progress into young adulthood, they tend towards movies with women who are Ad/TV Execs or News Columnists in big businesses in New York City. These women are never anything but the greatest at what they do. The women in these roles often have semi-wacky mishaps and either have a \"love interest\" male or witchy female competing with them for their jobs. There will also be a less attractive friend, probably played by Jeneane Garofolo.These are Stage 2 Chick Flicks.Many hours later of watching Lifetime and countless Danielle Steele novels about empowered female lawyers Learning To Love Again, the watcher of the Chick Flick is likely now in her mid 20s to early 30s. Their life has likely been a bitter disappointment on many fronts, and so they are prime targets for Stage 3 Chick Flicks. Stage 3 Chick Flicks generally include women who have had Struggles yearning To Do Stuff, and eventually doing whatever it was they were yearning about in the first place. And here we find Under The Tuscan Sun.The movie stars Diane Lane, who was also in Unfaithful, in which she has sex with someone other than Richard Gere. I'm not sure what bearing this has on the review, but it was a far superior movie. Diane's character's name is Frances. She is from San Fransisco, and therefore has lesbian friends. I imagine she also enjoys Starbucks and votes Democratic. Frances has recently gone through her divorce (clearly not her fault, as this is a chick flick) and is pretty bummed about it. Her gay friends (who are expecting a baby, of course)decide to give the gift of going on a Gay in Tuscany Tour.Once in Tuscany, Frances (or Francesca, we're in Italy now) decided to purchase a run-down villa. Evidently, it is incredibly easy for Americans to simply purchase Italian villas and decide to stay in the country. She is able to purchase the house because the old Italian lady sees a bird take a crap in the house. Seriously. Because. She. Sees. Bird. CRAP.Naturally, the house is a mess, and our journey of self-realization and feminine daydreaming is stopped in its tracks. Egads! The place is a mess! Much like her tortured psyche! And the roof leaks! And the toilet doesn't work! Ahhhh! At this rate, never will she find self-reliance or the ability to love again!One of the lesbians (the pregnant one) comes to live with her because the other lesbian ran out on her. Negligent parenting--it's not just for heteros anymore! Of course, she is free to travel while 8 months pregnant to Italy and stay for as long as she likes. \"Come on over!\" says Italy, \"Anything we can get for you? Stay as long as you need to, you poor alternative-lifestyle pregnant lady! You're everything an Italian villager would approve of!\"There's also a story about some Polish workers, but I don't remember the particulars. One of the guys was in love with a girl, and at some point threw some flags in the air to prove it. Then again, this entire movie was throwing up red flags, so my memory lapse is understandable.We also learn that Italian men have a zest for life, and this zest manifests itself into what can only be called \"stalking women in public\". Evidently, \"la dolce vita\" includes the need for restraining orders.Finally, the allegorical story of Frances' heart--I mean the house--is starting to come together, so she starts to fall in love with an Italian man who says things like \"I drown in your eyes\". He also drives a scooter, which just goes to show this guy is HARDCORE.Naturally, the guy ends up cheating on her. But that's ok, because she's learned to love herself, you see, and the once standoffish Italian neighbors now bring her veggies from their garden and say \"Buona Sera!\" to her each radiant Tuscan morning, and the vineyard (quoty fingers \"Frances' soul\")is bearing fruit. Also, her lesbian friend gives birth, seemingly unphased about doing so in the middle of rural Italy. I'm betting she didn't even transfer her Ob-Gyn records.I should mention throughout this movie Frances does not even have the damned civility to learn Italian. Apparently, evening classes were held so that the villagers could communicate in broken English. To add insult to injury, it seems living in Italy is enough to give you INCREDIBLE COOKING ABILITY. These ladies have been cooking Italian for 50 years, and Diane Lane blows them out of the water after 2 months.There's also an amazingly irritating retired actress who decides to dress up like Fellini characters and makes a spectacle of herself in public. I imagine this is supposed to be a tribute to one of the greats of film, but if I received a tribute like this, I would poke out my eyes.Anyhow, at the end, there's a nice wedding at the house and Diane West's character falls for a nice Italian guy. Miraculously, the faucet in the house begins to work. Of course, there is no symbolism intended, unless to suggest two hours of your life have gone down the drain.This film may be insulting to lesbians, Eurotrash, Tuscan villagers, Italian immigration officials, and people who hate clumsy symbolism. The whole movie is like some poor romance novel combined with the DNA of a witless idealist and a tract on colonialism, exposed to gamma radiation for 48 hours, and then unleashed upon an unsuspecting world. Some movies break suspension of disbelief for a moment and are ruined. Under the Tuscan Sun would just like to break into suspension of disbelief once. It looks and feels like the naive dreams of a housewife who couldn't point Italy out on a labeled map and thinks folks in different countries all just speak English with different accents.Two stars, simply because every movie I see from now on, no matter how horrible it is, I can say, \"well, it beats Under the Tuscan Sun\".",

    "review/text": "Having not read the book, I really didn't know what to expect. Let me tell you it was a pleasant surprise. For starters, Diane Lane was the perfect choice for the lead character Frances Mayes. She brings a natural reality to the character, instead of the saccharin sweet typically found in a romantic comedy. Diane instantly makes you feel like you know this woman. She's your neighbor, or someone you work with. In the scene after she learns of her husband's infidelities, she looks horrible - exactly like you'd expect like a woman would look after traumatic news. Of course Diane Lane is a very beautiful woman and as the movie progresses that becomes more and more apparent. Luckily Diane is more than just a pretty face and her performance is stellar. The movie as a whole is understated, letting things play out instead of spelling everything out and Diane provides a wonderful tapestry for you to see what is happening to her. Her reactions tell you more than pithy dialog ever could and as a result you end up taking the journey with her.As much as I loved Diane Lane in this movie, she is surrounded by an incredible supporting cast. Sandra Oh, as the best friend, delivers an authentic performance. Instead of the typical \"funny sidekick\" so often played by those in the role of best friend, she's down to earth and real. Raoul Bova plays the Italian lover and should make most women weak in the knees, but I found Vincent Riotta, the real estate agent, to be a much richer character. And speaking of rich characters, Lindsay Duncan plays a wonderful eccentric as Katherine who almost serves as a fairy godmother.Although the acting is superb, what bring it all together are the talents of Audrey Wells who serves as the screenplay writer, director and producer. Most of Audrey's background has been in writing. Clearly Ms. Wells has a love of Italy and a love of the novel and all of that shows on the screen. She filmed in the cities that are represented and she hired actors that are the nationality in which they play and the age in which they should be. The entire film shines with authenticity and coupled with wonderful performances and directing, Audrey has redefined the romantic comedy. This movie is a tune-up for the soul. If anyone has been down on their luck or not so lucky in love this movie will pour some sweetness into that bitter place. Highly recommended.",

    "review/summary": "Diane Lane renovates a villa and her life in Tuscany",
    "review/text": "This movie has two things going for it that are quite appealing to me. One is Diane Lane because we are now both old enough that I do not have to feel guilty about having a crush on her in 1979 when she was barely a teenager and I was in graduate school. The other is Tuscany, because films like this are siren calls for tourists, especially if half the blood flowing in your veins is Italian in the first place. As a result of those twin forces I probably had higher expectations for this film than is warranted by what director Audrey Wells has put together.The story is relatively simple. Frances Mayes is a writer and critic who finds out her husband is having an affair. There is more injury to add to this insult in terms of divorce, alimony that she owes him, and the loss of her house. With nothing better to do Frances is sent by her friend Patti (Sandra Oh) on a gay bus tour of Tuscany where she stumbles across a nice little villa for sale. Frances knows that the way her life is going buying it would be a terrible idea. But an eccentric expatriate named Katherine (Lindsay Duncan) tells her, &quot;Don't you just love those?&quot; So it comes to pass that Frances buys a Italian villa that is in as much need of repair as her own shattered life.The villa is obviously the master metaphor in this film for the main character, but Wells does not spend as much time on it as she should. Maybe it is because Bob Villa and all of those who have followed in his wake have been the restoration of old homes a familiar experience for us. One of the deleted scenes on the DVD shows the discovery of the fresco on one of the villa's walls, which is exactly the sort of detail that we want to enjoy. We know that this house will be a home by the end of the film, so it is the process of transformation that matters, especially as it parallels that of Frances herself.This movie wants to be unconventional. At one point Frances unburdens herself and is told by the compassionate man to whom she is speaking: &quot;Signora, please stop being so sad. If you continue like this, I will be forced to make love to you, and I've never been unfaithful to my wife.&quot; This movie is not Katharine Hepburn's trip to Italy in &quot;Summertime.&quot; For those who are waiting expectantly for the new man in Frances' life to come walking through the door, this film is going to tease you in that regard until you are forced to think that maybe something else is happening here.I know that Wells took great liberties with the book written by the real Frances Mayes, who restored an abandoned villa in Italy without the motivation of a brutal divorce, but since the author did not complain and I have not read the book I have no reason to complain on that score. Instead I will point to the fact this film is only 102 minutes long and that if this film had clocked in close to two hours Wells would have been able to flesh out the restoration of the villa and the eccentric neighbors that become so important in the cinematic Frances' new life as she goes native.The end of the film recognizes the importance of those two elements, but they are often overwhelmed over the course of &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; by the less than satisfactory romantic elements. Fortunately Lane's performance forgives many of the fault's of the script and shows that after her Oscar nominated performance in &quot;Unfaithful&quot; that she now has some serious momentum going on in her acting career. She is so busy being at the center of this story of how Frances puts her life back together than both the character and the audience are surprised by the arrival of the requisite happy ending.In the final analysis &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; is not going to convert anyone. Confirmed romantics are going to find enough of what they crave in this film to make themselves happy and those who roll their eyes at such endeavors will have ample occasion to keep their orbs spinning. Those who read Mayes' novel will be wondering why they even bothered to keep her name for the main character and those who are fans of Diane Lane will simply be ecstatic to see her name appearing above the title.",

I can't believe this film has so many gushing fans that love it so much.Sure, its pretty to look at, but ultimately the pretty scenery wears thin and your intelligence gets offended at every turn in the 'story'. In the alternate universe that this movie takes place in, there's no such thing as a visa, and piles of beautifully cooked food just pops into being. Vast quantities of it, too. And there's no need to work for money, just renovate a villa for free, and then spend your days swanning around in it. That's how you find true happiness.Obviously, this movie was made for Americans who will never leave the United States. Anyone who has travelled to another country knows the rigors of travel, and the difficulty involved in getting a visa for some countries, let alone a residency visa. I mean, you can't just be on a bus tour of another country, see a house for sale that you like, then buy it and live there forever. And then invite your friends from your country to come over and live there as well. The real world doesn't work like that!!!And lastly - it doesn't matter how fast you drive, there's NO WAY you can get from Tuscany to Positano in and hour! It takes nearly an hour to get from Naples to Positano, the road is so narrow and winding.Suspending belief for the duration of a movie is one thing - changing the universe to suit some idiot film-maker's idea of reality is another.

    "review/text": "O.K. People. You know enough about the basic plot from reading the DVD information. I liked this movie because it reminded me of several quirky movies I identified with. It has elements of Beaches and Shirley Valentine and, contrary to the negative reviews I have read here, that CAN be a good thing. It is a very visual movie and Ms. Lane feels her character so much that you feel with her and that speaks volumes. Her character does point out that she is making choices because she is tired of playing it safe so yes, she does sleep with a man she has barely met. If you are one of those people who quietly cheer the fed up employee who tells the boss to shove it and wish you could too, you will understand this movie. BUT. If you are one of these &quot;sheep people&quot; who lets the entire world dictate what they do to the point that you almost make a left turn in traffic just because the car in front of you does.... YOU WON'T. Touching movie with stunning visuals and a glimpse into what COULD happen if someone who has been through a life changing event simply lets go and runs towards the light of possibility. Real life? Who ever said a movie has to be about real life? What constitutes real? Unlock the braces on your brains and just watch...",

The male characters, except for the real estate agent, are not developed at all. The plot's premise revolves around a story someone told her. They (the governments of Italy and Austria?) built a railroad between Venice and Vienna through the Alps before they had a train that could make the trip. The point is that you have to have faith that every thing works out for those who make bizarre decisions. Diane Lane's character buys a house and builds a home in Tuscani, because after her divorce, she wants to rebuild her life. She wants a wedding at her home, a family to live at her house, etc. I agree. There is not much to the plot, but that's okay sometimes.One of the good features of the movie is the scenery. The town and the country side are stunning. Despite the plot, there are some touching moments. There is some humor. The bad features are that many of the characters are sterotypes and do not really live. Some of the characters' decisions make me scratch my head sometimes. Diane Lane's character is an author, but we never see her working on a book. She never seems to run out of money. She budgeted her money somewhat carefully when she bought the house and she had to have gone over her budget when she rebuilt the house and did some major landscaping. However, she never seems to have money problems after she bought the house. She was a professor so she must have lost her job when she moved.The point is do not analyze the movie too much and just relax.",

Life is not that simple!It is really the story of a woman who proves to herself that she can make it on her own, without a man, anywhere and anytime. On a trip to Italy, trying to take her mind off her recent divorce, she spontaneously buys an Italian villa...one which needs a lot of work and repairs...and settles herself in this country. She slowly makes it her home, while making friends in a foreign land and learning a new culture.I really enjoyed this movie for the scenes of Italy and its faithful presentation of Italian culture (not just the stereotypical view of Italians you get in American T.V. shows and movies). Besides the Italian people, there are Italian cuisine, beautiful villas, tours of the countryside, and people of other nationalities. I don't know how anyone can watch this film without seriously considering hopping on a plane and moving to Italy permanently.",

Diane Lane plays a fairly submissive role. She doesn't sparkle or shine, and neither does the cinematographer's rendition of the Tuscan countryside. There are some pretty scenes, but they don't carry over to set the mood for the film as they should. Certainly not enough to redeem this movie above standard fare. There are several likeable characters in the movie. I especially enjoyed the older,handsome,but unfortunately married real estate agent. I felt for Ms. Lane's character - too bad he was taken! I haven't read the book, but I read a review that said that actually the main character and her husband renovated the house in Tuscany (not the new divorcee on her own looking for love and fulfillment), so maybe that's why this movie falls short -too much artistic license. In any case, you might enjoy this light movie, or you might be disappointed, but if you like Diane Lane's natural beauty and intensity, you should see &quot;A Walk On the Moon&quot; (one of my favorite movies)and &quot;Unfaithful&quot;. Check out &quot;My House in Umbria&quot; with Maggie Smith if you like movies that take place in Italy.",

Freaky Friday, A Year in Provence (a TV miniseries), and now Under the Tuscan Sun.Under the Tuscan Sun is not a great movie, but it is pleasant and fun to watch. The book was pleasant as well, but Frances Mayes, the author of the book, did not seem like an easy person to know and came across as a bit of a snob. She was almost insufferable in her sequel book, Bella Tuscany.Diane Lane, as Frances Mayes in the movie, plays a different and more likeable character. In fact, about the only thing that is the same in the movie as in the book is that the house is called Bramasole and is in Tuscany.The Tuscan and San Francisco scenery is beautiful, Frances's Italian boyfriend is gorgeous (those lips!), and the plots weave their way to a happy, if unlikely, ending.Much of the story doesn't stand up well to scrutiny, but this isn't the sort of movie you really analyze too closely. Otherwise the eccentric character played by Lindsay Duncan, the spur-of-the-moment purchase of a Tuscan villa, and even the kitten on the beach, would all seem more than a little contrived.So enjoy this movie for what it is: a chick flick, date movie, or a bit of fluffy escapism to see once.",

    "review/text": "I found Under the Tuscan Sun to be a wonderful portrayal that we as human are at the whim of the chemistry of life and those who cross our path. Ultimately, life is about letting go of the old no matter how difficult.Lane plays an endearing main character who would cling to the old and society's definition of what she as a 30 something should have in her life at this time. By opening herself up to the novelty of life, her life unfolds in ways she doesn't expect (or even like at the time).The movie has a flow that keeps the viewer interested. The other characters play an inportant role in supporting the main character's mission to re-discover her life. The backdrop of Italy certainly heightened the romance of the movie. I didn't want the movie to end.At the end, the viewer is left with an invitation to not take things for granted and at the same time to shed those things in life that are stale and/or not working....and move on to accomplishing dreams that may have been sitting on the shelf. I have seen the movie three times.",

However, the resulting story comes out fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed how the director brought pieces of the reality into the fictionalized story. Ultimately, both the movie and the book are about letting go of the past, and living for the future. If you've been through a disillusionment, and you are working to redefine who you are and where you want to go in life, then you will enjoy both (Though I would recommend reading the book first). It also wouldn't hurt to be a woman in your thirties or older.In both the book and the movie, Francis Mayes comes out of a divorce looking for a new way to define her life. In both the book and the movie, she buys a Villa in Tuscany, and refurbishes it, learning about her new country and herself in the process, and falling in love with both. The big difference between the book and the movie (and don't read further if you don't want to know) is Ed. In the book, she and Ed have started dating when they buy the villa. In the Movie, she meets Ed at the end. I thought it was a clever way to wrap the movie up.",

    "review/text": "This film is about a suddenly divorced woman who ends up touring Italy with a group of gay men. The build up to this amusing tour is very creative, also the many antics on the tour bus were funny, due to the ironical fact that a single divorced female was on tour with a group of men - all of whom were gay. It is an amusing, down-right funny film in many ways. It is also an inexpensive way to see the landscapes of Tuscany.Starting a new life in Italy, on a whim, a spur of the moment, the need to escape, escape to another country, escape anywhere, is a fantasy, many people may have, especially if the people are divorced. The adventures of living in another country along with recovering one's sense of balance in life is the well developed topic of this film.The tour bus stops in a town and our heroine sees an old home for sale in the picture window of a real estate office. It happens the tour passes by this very same home and to the surprise of all, our protaganist asks the bus driver to stop. She enters the house and discovers a young European couple negotiating on the selling price with the owner, who is a widow, and her solicitor. Everytime the European couple offers a bid, the widow raises the price of the house. When our divorcee makes an offer ... the widow accepts it. The Europeann couple stalk off, complaining about how the rich Americans want to own everything.Our divorcee admits to the widow, she can not afford the price she agreed to. The widow shakes her head, sadly, \"no\". The widow states through an interpreter, the solicitor, that she must have a sign from G-d before she can sell the house, right after that, a bird flies in and leaves a parting gift on our divorcee's head. The widow is happy and smiles ... that is the sign. It only gets better from there ... This is hugely funny film, reminds me of the movies made in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Though the movie diverges quite widely from the book, Mayes herself says it captures her book's spirit, so that's good enough for me. There are some complaints here on these review pages about this being a 'formulaic chick flick,' but it's subversively anything but. Director Wells correctly points out in the 'Making Of' featurette that at the very moment in the chick flick formula where the love interest is supposed to appear (approx. 30 minutes in), we get a head fake...in fact, we get two of them & a true love interest appears only as an afterthought. Instead, Wells keeps the focus on Lane's character's efforts to establish a household and fill it with love. It's left to Raoul Bova (outstanding as Real Estate agent Marcello) to point out that Frances has done just that, right under her own nose. It's a superb moment.As an added bonus, it's a hoot for anyone who's watched \"Grey's Anatomy\" to see Sandra Oh and Kate Walsh here together...as a couple no less.",

Both the book and the movie make you want to visit Italy. I found that I appreciated the movie more on the second viewing when my expectations for immediate humor and romance were not so high. That's because -- like most Diane Lane parts -- you need to let yourself feel and grow with the main character. Personally, I fell in love with many of the characters and boy, do I want that house she renovated! The last time I watched the DVD, I followed up with listening to the director's commentary and was glad that I did. The director is generous in explaining how she developed the story, how she chose the actors, what difficulties she encountered during production and why she made the compromises that she did (not that I noticed any).",

    "review/text": "What I liked about this film was the theme of self-discovery and this wounded woman making time for herself. Also, you cannot totally dis a film with the achingly handsome Raoul (forget his last name, but he played Marcello.) I am a chick-flick loving female and he was just gorgeous, even when he was dumping her.However, some elements were too obvious. She's closed off emotionally and sexually, and can't find the snake that's just entered her house. Gee, what must the SNAKE symbolize? Oh, and just before she physically hooks up with the scrumptious Marcello, whom she has just met, a KITTEN appears. There's some nasty-word foreboding going on!I don't care how hurt you are. It never makes good sense to drive an hour with a man whom you just met in a foreign country. I can suspend disbelief, but that was just foolish, even in a chick flick.Additionally, the animation sequence of the sun setting and rising during the kiss was jarring. Same for the strange movement when she gazed into the old picture.I did enjoy Sandra Oh's performance, and even the sterotyped eccentric Lindsey Duncan had her moments. But the sum of the parts do not make a whole. It's worth renting, but not buying.I was most disappointed with the dependent-victim theme. Frances loses her life, finds hunky lover, loses hunky lover and begins to realize that perhaps the world revolves around more than her having a man. MAYBE her happiness can spring from inside, as in that of emotionally healthy people. This point would have been a great stopping point. But, no, we have to bring the young, handsome failed writer to rescue her psyche and self-esteem, and prove that she will not be happy until Prince Charming seeks her out.The stars are mostly for the beauty of the cinematography the contribution of the bit players.

This film could easily have evolved into an Italian Travelog with actors or succumbed to the facile ending, but instead it moved in unexpected directions everytime you seemed to know what would happen next. It really captures the joy and spirit of the Italian people without actually making that a focal point. The handling of the people and the locale were excellent because they never became the actual point of the movie. However, it is the ending that really sets this film apart, because the film builds to the conclusion that you should be careful what you wish for because you just might get it. And as usual when you get what you asked for God has a way of providing it in unexpected ways. I thought this was a subtle and entertaining film. I have seen it twice and enjoyed it both times.",

    "review/text": "This is my favorite film of all time. I recently visited Italy (Tuscany) and watched this movie many times before my trip. The directing, acting, filming, scenery and music were perfect. Audrey Wells (Best Director),Diane Lane (best actress), Lindsay Duncan (best supporting actress) and Christophe Beck (musical score) should have all received oscars. I spent most of my brief time in Italy, Under the Tuscan Sun, and it was a life-changing experience. I have always heard how beautiful Italy was; and the scenery & landscapes in the Italian-themed movies I've watched seemed almost too good to be true. But once I stood on Italian soil, mingled with the wonderful people, devoured the food and wine (& GELATO!) and tossed euros in the Trevi Fountain (yes, I made my wish!), I now realize what a treasure Italy is: The mediterranean blue, Italian terracotta, pristine green and violet & crimson sunset make one want to hop on a plane to Rome. Italy is truly Heaven on Earth and the Food is Divine. I felt blessed to be a part of Italy for a brief time and anxiously look forward to returning one day to my possible future home. Every time I watch UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN, it takes me right back to Italy! Buon Anno!",

    "review/text": "Diane Lane is a wonderful actress. She has the ability to go through a range of emotions within a few seconds in the most natural way, conveying conflicted, confused feelings better than 10 pages of dialog. The movie itself was a very pleasant surprise. While it is a light romantic comedy, it avoids becoming just another paint-by-numbers film. Just when you think it's about to fall into the standard formula, it makes a quick left turn. It actually has a lot of truth in it. Anyone, male or female, who has been through a divorce and all that goes along with it emotionally can relate to it. Only a few, though, will find the courage (and proper encouragement) to not allow it to define the rest of their lives. The film tells us this basic truth: To have any chance of ever finding happiness in life, you must always be willing to risk it all, in spite of any doubts or pain you may yet have. If you are so stuck that you cannot take giant leaps of faith, even though you yet have fears, you might as well go shopping for your burial plot right now.",

    "review/text": "Wednesday was my birthday so my wife reluctantly allowed me to pick the movie we were going to see. \"Grindhouse\"! Much to my displeasure and her relief the local bijou pulled \"Grindhouse\" because of recent events in Virginia that could spur copycats. So we picked up some wine coolers and went home and watched \"Under the Tuscan Sun\". Now I've been a big fan of Diane Lane for a number of years. \"A Walk on the Moon\" is incredibly underrated. But something about this pictured screamed \"Chick Flick!\" Boy, was I ever right. In a nutshell, spurned literary critic(Lane) takes a trip to Tuscany with some oh-so cute gays(are there any other kind in chick flicks?). Did I mention that her best friends are a lesbian couple played by Sandra Oh, possibly the world's most unattractive Asian and Kate Walsh, late from one of my all-time fave TV shows, \"The Drew Carey Show\". On impulse she buys a run-down villa in sunsplashed Tuscany. Employs some mildly comical Polish workers who have problems hooking up the hot water. Falls for a cad naturally named Marcello. A pregnant Oh comes to visit explaining that she was dumped by Walsh. Lane plays matchmaker to a young Polish worker and one of the local girls. You can pretty much figure out how it all ends. My wife's tear ducts were going. I viewed the proceedings with mild indifference. I give it three stars, my wife gives it five. We've reached a compromise on how to rate this flick.",

The rest of the film pretty much writes itself: Frances will take the tour, go through various adventures, meet new and interesting people and (most likely) find love.The redeeming feature of this predictability is the smart writing and the intelligent acting. Diane Lane, as Frances, projects a wide rage of subtle and even conflicting emotions, Lane is what made the movie not only bearable, but even enjoyable.Some people love amusement parks and love riding roller coasters. The fun is not the similarity of the ride -- it goes up; it goes down; it goes back to where it started from -- but in appreciating the craft and subtle variations that go into each coaster. \"Tuscan Sun\" is like that. You pretty much know that all will be well, but you can appreciate the wonderful artistry it took to make it. This ride includes gay mothers, an aging Fellini's star still recreating her roles, a Polish construction crew, a grandmother with an e-mail boyfriend, swarthy flirts and lovers and an ancient Tuscan estate that badly needs resurecting.Hang on and enjoy the ride!",

The result is an enjoyable, light-hearted, and decently paced dramedy.Diane Lane is perfectly cast and Sandra Oh IS Patti. They both bring so much to all their roles and greatly enhanced the story and move it forward. Both actresses have an undeniable charm and make even the worse film worthwhile.This is a good film though, full of beautiful scenery and great performances.

    "review/text": "Under the Tuscan Sun is a pleasant story, bolstered by the undeniable appeal of a wonderful actress. Diane Lane far outshines the various inadequacies of the story and its script. Granted, Ms. Lane could coast through this bit of fluff relying on little more than her luminescent beauty alone, yet she provides plenty of texture and nuance to her role as a writer/reviewer looking to rebound from a particularly painful divorce.Lane's character, Frances is persuaded to take the place of two lesbian friends on a guided tour of Tuscany (under the banner of \"We're Gay... and Away\"). Believably or not, she leaves the tour mid-bus ride to purchase a small villa in need of a lot of repair. The \"uprooting your life on a whim\" device is a little trite, but then who hasn't fantasized about a dramatic relocation as the cure for a life crisis? From there the story (what little there is of it) balances between a voyage of personal discovery and the tale of an Italian money pit (a lire loser perhaps).Sandra Oh does well as Frances' pregnant friend and Lindsay Duncan catches notice in a poorly defined role as the local eccentric expatriate, but neither actress is given much purpose other than to provide dialogue and the occasional mild shock. The real costar here is the gorgeous scenery of Tuscan Italy, so much so that I'd recommend this movie to anyone contemplating a vacation to that region.The ultimate verdict regarding Under the Tuscan Sun is that it is light fare, that provides a visual feast combining the wonderful appeal of one of Hollywood's truly great beauties along with some of the most romantic countryside you'll ever see. Women will enjoy Lane's growing empowerment and self-discovery, while men will simply enjoy watching her, and all will treasure the locale and the people of Tuscany.",

However....The rest was just awful! The whole storyline is predictable and it's another example of Hollywood using the same formula at scoring for an audience. This movie had the potential to be good, I just wish Hollywood didn't interfere with the process. Because it is a Hollywood film, it has no depth and every problem had (surprise surprise!) a miracle-fairytale-love-can-conquer-all-happily-ever-after-solution. In typical fashion, the movie is also full of ignorant stereotypes. You have your leading beautiful, blond actress (Diane Lane - who is not a bad actress that's why I feel sorry for her that she had to be in this film), a token Asian friend (because of course you need a minority to be correct in Hollywood's ridiculously politically correct world), and of course Italian people that they stereotyped to death. If you talk to any real Italian or European person they will tell you that this is a disgrace to what Europeans pride themselves on being. Hollywood thinks they know about different cultures and the rest of the world, but after seeing this film, you wonder if any of the people who made this film ever actually had any friends that weren't American.",

As another reviewer rightly assessed, obviously the screenwriter could not make enough of the book as it stood (no fault of the book) and therefore made liberal changes of great magnitude to the point where the two have little more in common than a villa in Tuscany. The film does not capture the spirit of the book, which is that Frances and her best friend Ed are so comfortable in their mutual love and lives together that their joie de vivre naturally extends to the villa, transforming it from a shambles to a beautiful piece of antiquity, as well as to their new surroundings in Italy (the town and people of Cortona). To their great joy and surprise, Italy embraces them as well. The book has nothing to do with the Diane Lane character, who spends most of the film looking for love in the wrong places (or crying over love lost due to poor choices), while restoration of the villa and discovery of her new surroundings become a dim backdrop to her own shallow escapades and the problems of her girlfriend (both figments of the screenwriter's imagination). What a shame that such a beautifully written book got lost in this poorly written and acted film.",

    "review/text": "Following a divorce in which she loses her shirt due to California's community property laws, Frances Mayes, an author and book reviewer, goes on a trip to Cortona, Italy, where she ends up buying Bramasole, an ancient villa from a countess and sets about rebuilding the ruins of her life amid the beautiful countryside. Her thoughts are voiced through a voiceover narrative, in which her wry wit comes through.Much of her interractions come through with the restoration of the villa, which she decides to undergo after a fierce thunderstorm on her first evening there. The repair work undergone there presents some comic moments, as well as triumphant ones. There are three Polish workers she enlists, one into books, one who is clearly smitten by her, and Pavel, a blonde youth who falls for Chiara, the daughter of the family next door. Frances befriends Pavel, even to the point of sticking up for him when Chiara's parents find out about their the young couple's liaison.Then there's her friend Patty, an Oriental lesbian who's very pregnant and is planning to raise the baby with her partner. She is the sole representative of her earlier life, and her appearance in the villa signifies that one can't completely break away from one's roots. That concept is also demonstrated by an old man who keeps putting flowers at a stone shrine across her. She waves at him but he refuses to return her gesture, merely staring at her with his sad, broken-hearted face which, like Frances, made me wonder what his story was.However, the most interesting one is Katherine, a blonde English expatriot dressed in black, with a penchant for wide brimmed hats and eating ice-cream cones. She is a direct contrast to Frances, savouring life, even modelling semi-nude for an Italian studmuffin named Zeus.Two ideas come through in this movie. One is something that Katherine tells Frances, never to lose your childhood innocence, something told her long ago by Fifi, a.k.a. Federico Fellini. There's a nod to Silvia's fountain scene from La Dolce Vita involving her.The other is things falling into place even though the circumstances aren't right. In a moment of unsurety, Frances's wish to one day have a family and wedding in a villa she wonders if she should have bought, is given an analogy by Martini, her real estate agent, who tells her of a railway build between the place and Vienna even there were no trains built in Italy. Eventually, the trains were built and were ready for the railway. Still another analogy is the story Katherine tells of hunting high and low for ladybugs. Tired, she fell asleep on the grass, and upon waking up, found herself covered with them.The scenery is a panoply of beauty, be it the sparkling blue Mediterranean, the fields of red flowers, or the white-columned buildings in the city. Diane Lane is a marvel as Frances, expressive in moments of hurt, doubt, and of course sheer joy, especially when she scores for the first time since her divorce. She even has a nice bemused laugh that charmed me, and her playing a character I wanted to root for through her trials. And she looks stunning in that white dress. I see a Best Actress nomination here. However, Lindsay Duncan steals the movie as Katherine, and despite her limited screen time, is certainly a character to watch. Best Supporting Actress maybe?And Vincent Riotta lends strong support as the reserved but sympathetic Martini. Movies comparable to this include A Room With A View and Enchanted April, on finding oneself and following one's dreams even in the face of emotional disaster, so don't automatically stick this with the \"chick flick\" label.So glad I went to see this the day before it left my local theatre!",

    "review/text": "I am not a huge fan of the romantic comedy genre. More often than not, a romantic comedy is nothing more than a few good looking people thrown together and saddled with a lousy script. That's not to say that there aren't notable exceptions, but for the most part they suck. Based on the previews for this movie, I didn't have high hopes, however I did receive a free pass to watch a sneak preview for the movie, so how could I say no?Having not read the book, I really didn't know what to expect. Let me tell you it was a pleasant surprise. For starters, Diane Lane was the perfect choice for the lead character Frances Mayes. She brings a natural reality to the character, instead of the saccharin sweet typically found in a romantic comedy. Diane instantly makes you feel like you know this woman. She's your neighbor, or someone you work with. In the scene after she learns of her husband's infidelities, she looks horrible - exactly like you'd expect like a woman would look after traumatic news. Of course Diane Lane is a very beautiful woman and as the movie progresses that becomes more and more apparent. Luckily Diane is more than just a pretty face and her performance is stellar. The movie as a whole is understated, letting things play out instead of spelling everything out and Diane provides a wonderful tapestry for you to see what is happening to her. Her reactions tell you more than pithy dialog ever could and as a result you end up taking the journey with her.As much as I loved Diane Lane in this movie, she is surrounded by an incredible supporting cast. Sandra Oh, as the best friend, delivers an authentic performance. Instead of the typical \"funny sidekick\" so often played by those in the role of best friend, she's down to earth and real. Raoul Bova plays the Italian lover and should make most women weak in the knees, but I found Vincent Riotta, the real estate agent, to be a much richer character. And speaking of rich characters, Lindsay Duncan plays a wonderful eccentric as Katherine who almost serves as a fairy godmother.Although the acting is surpurb, what brings it all together are the talents of Audrey Wells who serves as the screenplay writer, director and producer. Most of Audrey's background has been in writing. This is only her second film as a director, yet you wouldn't know it by watching the film. Clearly Ms. Wells has a love of Italy and a love of the novel and all of that shows on the screen. She filmed in the cities that are represented and she hired actors that are the nationality in which they play and the age in which they should be. The entire films shines with authenticity and coupled with wonderful performances and directing, Audrey has redefined the romantic comedy.This movie was refreshing, witty, poetic, dramatic and rich with characters that you not only like, but identify with. It was such a breath of fresh air that I'm ready to see it again and again.",

    "review/text": "I read Frances Mayes's book \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" before watching this film and gladly so. While the film took a different road than the book they both wound up smack dab in the middle of beautiful Tuscany each with its own brilliance.This film was adapted from an original memoir by writer/teacher Frances Mayes as she undertook the renovation of a Tuscan villa. The book is actually quite different than the story in the film but both are wonderful. Diane Lane stars as Frances and the story begins with divorce and the loss of love but it evolves into a sensual journey into Tuscany and ends with genuine love. Lane discovers herself while on a much needed vacation to Italy. She stumbles across a few signs that lead her to buy a beautiful, although run-down, Tuscan villa. This is where the real story begins filled with extraordinary shots of the beauty that can only be found in Tuscany and a brief examination of what makes life in Tuscany so amazing. Lane hires four workers, one Italian and three Polish, to renovate her treasured villa. Along the way walls fall down in clouds of billowing smoke, water boils where it shouldn't, thunder storms create havoc for humans and owls, olive trees begin to bear fruit, and relationships begin to form from a great supporting cast.This movie about a lost woman found is a true inspiration. Lane is excellent as the middle aged woman who loses her sense of self and discovers she never lost it after all. The movie is about life and love, beauty and new discoveries but mostly it is about family, that richness that gives us life, whether our own or one we pluck from available sources. The scenes are filled with the beauty of Italy, flowers in bloom, wine and food prepared with love and great effort is paid to the scenic views of such a rich country. Be prepared to look for signs of your own after watching this film, craving a table full of food with a family to sit down and enjoy it with and you may even find yourself booking the next flight to Tuscany for some villa shopping of your own under the glorious Tuscan sun of course.",

    "review/text": "Thousands of years ago, long before the Romans came on the scene, Italy was under the hegemony of a people known as the Etruscans. Eventually they were conquered by the Romans and were absorbed into the Roman Empire. Today, there is but one place in Rome which gives a hint to their existence: Tuscany.Today, we have the pleasure of having none other than Diane Lane as our tour guide of the verdant countryside of Tuscany. Ms. Lane potrays a woman who is recovering from a devastating divorce. While on an Italian tour she impulsively buys a run-down Italian villa that is out in the country. The story depicts the interesting parallel of her attempts to fix up the house as symbolic of her efforts to put her life back together after having to endure the emotional wrecking ball of a nasty, mean-spirited divorce.If I were to describe Diane Lane in one word, it would be likeable. Yes, she is gorgeous and she has a smokin' hot body. However, just one word would be likeable. She is the type of person we'd all relish to have as our next-door neighbor - for reasons that extend WELL beyond her physical appearance. She is likeable even when she plays characters that are not-so-likeable, as she did in the movie UNFAITHFUL.Some would categorize this movie as a Romantic Comedy. I'm not so sure I would. Yes, there are some comical scenes in it, but I would lean a little more towards calling it a drama due to the depth of character development.In summary, I would basically recommend this movie to 3 demographics of persons: Italians, non-Italians and everyone else. Now, go out & enjoy Tuscany with Diane Lane!!",

    "review/text": "Diane Lane has always, even as a child reminded me of Natalie Wood. Both were child stars, both posses a similar beauty and way with a smile that turns up just so on the sides. Each is a multi-layered actress of considerable talent. And above all they have made me fall rapturously in love with them. My ability therefore to give a rational review of this film, \"Under The Tuscan Sun\" is reduced to that of a love struck thirteen year old boy.From the book of the same name by Frances Mayes the film is an altered and fresh look at the original. The direction and screenplay by Audrey Wells is top notch and she gives an insightful commentary on the DVD of her film. It is in her screenplay is where she really shines. She reshapes Mayes book into something magical and infuses it with the charm and glamour of Italy both in the flesh and in the movies.Vincent Riotta is the quite center to the story and is the romantic realist who gently leads Frances into her adventure in Italy. He commands your attention with a quiet and wise presence. Raoul Bova, one of the hottest stars in Italy brings just the right touch of romance and danger to his role as Marcello. In his final scene he is both honest and fair.Sandra Oh hits all the right notes of comedy and drama as Frances' best friend Patti. Her remark on the steaming toilet is a study in comedy timing. Well, she is a master as anyone who has seen her work on Arliss can attest.The wonderful discovery in this film for me is the British actress, Lindsay Duncan who portrays Katherine, the ex-Fellini star who is trapped like a fly in amber by her film past but lives for today within her celluloid cocoon. Adding her to the mix puts just the right touch of cinema magic into the story. I am looking forward to see what she does on the upcoming HBO series \"Rome\".Finally there is Miss Lane. Her work here is brilliant and filled with the grit and grime of a true actress at work. Yet it is seamless and so natural without a false move or an unsure moment. She inhabits Frances from frame one and caries her and the audience from her despair to rebirth and rejoicing in a new and unexpected life. Her eyes, her smile, her glowing skin become so real on the screen and we find we are given a gift from this actress of so many gifts. We are given the pure joy of watching her in the here and now inhabit a space in our hearts. With this film and her previous appearance in \"Unfaithful\" she joins the pantheon of stars that like Spencer Tracy, Ingrid Bergman, or Natalie Wood who make it all look so easy, so real.",

I went into this film with very low expectations, boy am I sick of the continuous stream of worthless romantic drivel Hollywood has been turning out lately. This one is different, folks. It has something that most films don't: heart.A successful and happily married San Francisco writer, Frances Mayes, life turns upside down when she discovers that her husband is cheating on her and gets a divorce. Heartbroken, depressed, and suffering from writer's block, her best friend Patti convinces her to take a vacation to Italy. Acting on a surge of spontaneity, Frances purchases a beautiful yet run-down villa in Tuscany.The script, based on the book of the same name, is just wonderful. It flows in a beautiful way and the voice-overs by Frances are lyrical and poetic. The story is full of realistic and fascinating characters, humor, heart, and, of course, the beautiful Tuscan scenery. The thing I most love about this film (and there are many things to love) is its poignant examination of human vulnerability, relationships, love and loss. \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" is a true cinematic masterpiece.",

    "review/summary": "An Unrealistic Worldview",
    "review/text": "Movies approach responses to pain in either one of two ways: embrace the pain and fight through to experience breakthroughs in character, or avoid the pain as much as possible and recreate your life. Robert Duvall finds out his wife is having an affair in The Apostle and embarks on a journey of spiritual healing and personal revival. Diane Lane finds out her husband is having an affair in Under the Tuscan Sun and she runs to Italy, becomes determined to make her own fun, and sleeps with a man she just met.The problem is, her philosophy just doesn't work in real life. Can anybody honestly say that hiding our pain behind wine, romance, and laughter permanently heals the wounds? Are they not going to resurrect themselves later in even uglier ways? Ironically, it doesn't work for the Diane Lane character either, but her disappointment is more of a plot construction than a message to viewers about the folly of pain management.You owe it to yourself. Be happy. Make yourself feel better, whatever it takes. Isn't that kind of hedonism the baseline for crack addicts, drunks, and promiscuous folks? I would write this movie off as a harmless romp with beautiful scenery, but with characters representing divisive views on pregnancy, lesbianism, and sexual liberty, the movie's creator had far more in mind than a simple romantic comedy. This movie has a message. But the message celebrates the myth of pain avoidance, and that is a worldview far from reality.",

    "review/summary": "Every cliche Under The Tuscan Sun.",
    "review/text": "Suffering a rank case of postmodern personality disorder - dead split between traditional and avant-garde mores - \"Under The Tuscan Sun\" seeks to embrace its main character, a divorced writer reinventing her life along with a villa in the Italian hills, and then poke fun at her, doling out equal amounts of ladybugs and Fellini. It plays a basic genre con, pretending to be a Travel Picture while its main trade is the same movie-of-the-week dramatics Lisa Hartman has been gnashing her teeth over for years.Diane Lane, in an apology for her brave, sexy performance in \"Unfaithful,\" is Frances Mayes, jilted and unmoored on a gay tour of Italy (set up by her gay friend, played by Sandra Oh) while writing esteemed lines on postcards such as \"ding, dang, dong, the bell rang\" and stumbling upon a house and garden ripe for remodeling, and her entire bank account.Writer/director Audrey Wells doesn't particularly consider this villa with her camera; we get glimpses of rooms, a concept of the garden, but Lane never presented in anything but regal close-up. There are obligatory, Remember-It's-Tuscany helicopter shots, but the movie's two most impressive visuals - a sunset on the beach and Florence at dawn - are special f/x, blue screen manipulations. Shameless.But Wells isn't out for an American version of \"Enchanted April.\" She is, however, offering the full tour of women's issues: divorce (in her book by the same name, Mayes refurbishes the villa with her husband), pregnancy, forbidden young love, sex, kind married men, swarthy younger men, silent older men who leave flowers at alters for no apparent reason, and finally, famous movie directors, say Federico Fellini, who apparently thought a great deal of all things child - enthusiasm, innocence, naivete, stupidity. Fellini is dead, but his wisdom is channeled through a goofy blonde bombshell who poses nude for a painting one afternoon while drinking tea with nuns the next morning.There are dreams about white dresses, mewling kitties (did Wells mistake Fellini for Luis Bunuel?) flag-tossing expeditions, days in the olive fields, thunderstorms, snakes, signs from God via pigeons and a motorcycle ride through a seaside resort. The motorcycle ride, featuring Lane done up to the nines, is a particularly odd scene, considering the joke laid at Frances' feet by the end of that ride.But \"Under The Tuscan Sun\" is full of such contrasts, vesting in Frances' want to have and find love, then exposing the quest as fraud, as if to be a grind of feminist theory Frances must survive before passing out the other side and meeting a servile, unworthy guy in the movie's final five minutes - literally - as if that God of thunderstorms and ladybugs sent him through Tuscany as reward.Lane is appealing and gorgeous but she mugs as badly as Meg Ryan on Theatre Sunday; her face pops and seethes and scowls and explodes in happiness and, quite often, settles on a bizarre, quizzical frown unbecoming of a woman in her late thirties, who should have figured a few things out by now. Frances is written as vulnerable, and Lane hits that mark with an obviousness that's meant to be funny; at times it works, at others Lane just shambles around. Yes, she's capable enough of opening and carrying a movie, if that was the point, but Lane need not play a half-witted fourth fiddle in Julia Roberts country just to avoid the tagalong role in Keanu Reeves sports films.For Wells, who had wrote \"The Truth About Cats and Dogs\" and \"Guinevere,\" the failure is not surprising: Frankly, she's skilled in relationship territory, hapless otherwise. \"Under The Tuscan Sun\" mines the same ridiculous \"in a foreign land, everyone's a kook!\" material beaten to pulp - in fact, Europeans are not half as juiced up and loud as Americans - while teaching its lesson on What Women Should Want.Bizarre, right-angled stuff like recreating the fountain scene from Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\" speaks to Wells' arrogance and true aim - only a small portion of the audience, and hardly anyone under forty, will have the foggiest idea what that scene is, or was, about. Whether it was a pander to the arthouse crowd or a tack at smartening up the target audience, it's an ugly bit of filmmaking in a picture full of nose-cutting and face-spiting.",

He takes one look at her flowery, overwrought prose and throws it down in disgust, saying, \"Mom will never believe I wrote that!\" Like the words on that postcard, there are many cringe-worthy moments in this film.We get a homogenized, romanticized view of Tuscany, the way most middle-aged American women who feel unloved by their cloddy spouses might imagine it. Stereotypes abound--there's the red-hot younger Italian lover (named Marcello, of course) whose broken English is supposed to be charming; the free-spirited, batty English woman (the fabulous Lindsay Duncan trapped inside a cliche) who takes joy in shocking the locals; the star-crossed young lovers; the elderly man still pining for his dead love; and the sassy yet approachable gay friend.Diane Lane is stunning as usual, but she mugs for the camera and hams it up a la Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan in too many instances, as if the audience might be too stupid to pick up on nuanced emotion. She's played unhappy characters of this age before, and much more subtly and convincingly, in \"Unfaithful\" and \"A Walk on the Moon.\"The views of Tuscany are gorgeous and motivation enough to make you want to drop everything and run off to Italy, even if the film itself is a forgettable, sometimes fun romp.",

I hope that Frances Mayes took the money and ran, because in this chick flick to end all chick flicks she's portrayed as almost a total bimbo, whereas she was actually running a department at a university.The problem is that the producer took very small parts of books on renovating a house in Tuscany, and added a totally unrelated focus on love. People love at every corner, and our heroine, who in both books spent almost all her time with her boyfriend, is bouncing uncontrollably around all the foreigners, all of whom might have an affair with her even though they're married.The chick-flickyedness of the movie goes over the top, with the producer not willing to give up the slightest clich&eacute;. You want kittens? We have kittens! You want babies? We have babies! You want handsome men who will have an affair with you, even though they've just met you? Got them too! Too bad none of the books had this. That also goes for the Italian public servant, who is a ravishing blonde who used to be a Fellini starlet, and the boy-toy polish worker who is sleeping with his girlfriend in Mayes' bed.Just when you think it can't get any worse, the asian friend of Mayes (another producer invention) shows up after you were glad she'd been left in the USA, and proceeds to give an even more leaden performance than at the beginning of the movie. However, this gives Diane Lane the chance to make meaningful but meaningless facial expressions (check out Lane's look when Sandra Ho is dancing, holding her baby).I think that if you find this movie fascinating reading either of the books will be an intellectual challenge.",

    "review/text": "There are so many reviews already for this 2003 movie that I didn't think one more was necessary, however, I have read so much unjust criticism of the film with regard to stereotypes and the Italian characters that I thought perhaps a few home facts from an Italian native might be in order (and I will try my hardest not to give away the plot). For a start, the portrayal of the people is very well done, although it certainly shows Italians mostly on their best behaviour, but still very accurate. They are generally helpful, friendly and quick to accept Americans and other foreigners especially if the \"stranieri\" appear to sincerely appreciate a different lifestyle and don't focus entirely on the inefficiencies and shortcomings that go along with it. The scene in the notary's office is a very good example. The deal is done in a competent way but with a good dose of humanity. The people in the street scenes are as authentic as can be, they are Cortona residents and, unsurprisingly, speak with the local accent. The building crew are Polish and that explains their accents.I was amazed to find so much venom directed at the Marcello character. His behaviour became perfectly understandable if one grasped the fact that months had elapsed between their initial meeting and the later one. The parade of potential builders is obviously meant to be a comic caricature of personalities, but it really doesn't stray too far from the truth. I have met people just like them. In fact, all the characters in the movie are fairly believable, the single exception being Ed, who (even considering his limited role) is completely wooden and exhibits the personality of the proverbial door-knob.I detest the term \"chick flick\" and this film does not deserve it. I think the story was handled with such a soft, restrained hand that it was misinterpreted as being lightweight, when in fact it dealt undramatically with many human dramas. Not everything has to be guts and gore to be heart-felt. I thought Diane Lane gave a perfectly nuanced performance, her character suffered a great deal and yet she tried to handle the collapse of her marriage and ultimately her entire life in a dignified and adult way. Any sensitive person would feel her distress, no histrionics needed. The many supporting actors also gave warm, masterfully well-judged performances; particularly good, in my opinion, were Vincent Riotta, Lindsay Duncan and Pawel Szajda.The single failing of the film might be that grasping a random opportunity and rebuilding a happy life out of the ruins of your previous one is too often a dream that does not come true, but I will never complain about an optimistic and uplifting viewpoint. It certainly beats the current fixation with wallowing in the ugliest and vilest possible view of mankind which so-called \"serious\" film makers try to pass off as gritty realism.The photography is of the highest level, the Tuscan countryside and Positano coastline appear in all their glory (even off-season) and Audrey Wells did a great job of the screenplay and direction, despite the obvious technical challenges of adapting a book to the wide screen and, apparently, a tight budget. And finally, contrary to another common complaint, my OH and I both enjoy watching this beautiful production and do so at regular intervals whenever we need a bit of cheering up and a virtual visit to the Tuscany we know and love.",

    "review/text": "This warm, beautiful, and often magical film from Audrey Wells would surely have been an Academy Award darling if made decades ago, as its tone and message, not to mention performances, fit more into the old-style filmmaking of a Hollywood now long gone. Diane Lane is simply marvelous as a woman whose world is turned upside down by divorce. In an attempt to start her life over and recapture the joy in life, she purchases a run down villa in Tuscany. Audrey Wells, who directed and co-produced the film with Tom Sternberg, also adapted Frances Mayes' book, giving this film the heavenly scent of grapes on the vine and the visual beauty of a field of sunflowers on an Italian hillside.Diane Lane is Frances, suddenly, and quite unexpectedly single again. Wondering how you breathe again when your world is shattered, Lane perfectly captures that stunned feeling of years wasted when a marriage ends. The wind is taken from the San Francisco writer's sails when someone half her age takes her place, which though cliche'd, is often the case. Sandra Oh of Grey's Anatomy fame lends fine support as Frances's friend, Patti, who refers to Frances's new place as 'camp divorce'. Adrift at sea emotionally, Frances has not moved forward despite having enough cash from the settlement to do so. When Patti experiences a similar heartbreak, she offers her friend the ticket to romantic Italy she can no longer use.Frances feels a change within herself, realizing if she truly is to recover from seeing her world crumble, she must build another one. After a chance meeting with Katherine (Lindsay Duncan), a free-spirited former Fellini actress, Frances jumps in with both feet, purchasing a run-down Italian villa called Bramasole. Vincent Liotta is excellent as the kind and decent realtor, Martini, who will become a true friend to Frances. There is an especially touching scene between the two as Frances realizes she has bought a house for which she doesn't have the life. The humorous elements of fixing up a 300 year old house on the hills of Tuscany are handled well by director Wells, adding great charm to a tender story, juxtaposing the ebb and flow of rebuilding a life and a villa. The happily married Martini has great affection for Frances nonetheless, aiding her by finding a group of Polish builders looking for work.The workers become part of her family as she refurbishes both her live and her villa. Pawel (Pawel Szajda), the youngest of the workers, falls in love Chira (Giulia Steigerwalt), the daughter of Frances's next door neighbor daughter, prompting Frances to intercede for her new family member with the girl's disapproving family. A simple white dress becomes a poignant image when Frances rediscovers the joy and excitement of new love with Marcello (Raol Bova), only to discover there is pain in learning to live again. That realization is soon confirmed when a devastated and quite pregnant Patti shows up on her doorstep in need of a shoulder. It is Frances's friend Martini who will come to her rescue again, however, opening her eyes to the fact that all her dreams have actually come true, if only she will use her heart to see them.This wonderful and life-affirming film ends at a wedding reception, proving that unthinkably good things can happen, even late in the game. The warmth and charm on display here is of another era, and was unfortunately scoffed at by many critics. Audrey Wells has made a sweet and ultimately joyful film about the living of life itself. A moist ocean breeze and the flavorful aroma of Italian food as it simmers seem to hang over every frame of celluloid used. Superlative photography from Geoffrey Simpson captures the many colors of Italy, the flag throwing festival where young Pawel tries to win over Chira's parents especially beautiful. Christophe Beck's score seems to fit every mood and situation without intruding upon the scene. Finally, Diane Lane gives a very gentle and old-style performance that fits the tone of this lovely film. Great and wonderful things occur even later in life, and often when we least expect them. That is the lovely message of this film.",

    "review/text": "*spoilers*This has to be one of my favorite chick flicks I've watched. While most others are completely predictable and hackneyed, this one throws some curve balls in there to make it unique.Go watch \"Eat Pray Love\" and you'll see the major differences in, what is essentially, the same story. Frances is a much more relatable and likable character who's motivations and fears are fully fleshed out. Both movies suffer from the travel stereotypes, but \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" explores the relationship that Frances develops with her new home. Settling in Italy was a spur of the moment decision in avoidance of going back to a life she hates (rather than making a separate decision to \"find herself\" in another country). Living in this run down house didn't solve her problems, but was a metaphor for her working through the failure of her marriage.My two absolute favorite parts of this movies is the fact that, unlike every other chick flick in existence, Frances gets everything she wanted out of life, but not in the way she imagined. She tried so hard to make a new romantic interest work to replace what she lost, but she realized that romance was not enough. It isn't until she realizes how wonderful her life really was, despite her lack of romance, that the One enters into the picture. I loved that the One wasn't an integral part of the story, but rather the icing on top of the cake.",

    "review/text": "By the title of this movie, you really can tell what you're in for, beautiful Tuscany!This film goes way beyond the typical 'romantic comedy', it really is all about one woman's struggle and happiness,(Diane Lane) of putting her life all back in order after her cheating husband decides he does not love her anymore; and after ludicrous demands from the husband in a very short legal realm. She is off to try to put her life in order.With the beautiful support of her best friend, Sandra Oh (who does a brilliant character study of her own in this movie) as her friends trade in their tickets to the unbelievable beautiful Tuscany, for a single ticket for their dear friend Frances (Lane), who after a bit of persuading takes it and takes off!!!What could be a better dream for oneself, then to have wonderful friends, like these, during these horrid times in life? Oh and her friends were originally going to use the tickets together themselves, although decide it more adequate for Frances to take this necessary vacation.While on a bus tour in Italy, Frances spies a villa that she is captivated with instantaneously, gets off to find out the particulars and ends up purchasing it, with all it's foibles and beauty.Frances hires local men who ultimately become 'her away from home family', to all help restore the home and landscape to what it was-somewhat, like before. It is centuries old now.This lovely film is more a 'romance', if you will, of a new country: It's diverse cultures, it's people, it's wonderful foods, it's rich history and traditions, it's exceptional beauty, ect., than that of the intimacy of a woman and a man.There are a couple of pullings in that direction, one with Frances, and the other, which is beautifully done by one of her local helpers whom she cares for deeply, as she does all of them after a short bit of time.This kind of relationship is not what the film is about, I think that is why it is so refreshing everytime I view it, and that has been many times now. This is just the first time I 'added my 2 cents to it'.I definitely feel like this is a great movie to take a look at, especially women who really would like to \"get away to Italy\" for about a couple of hours. And take a good look around with director Audrey Wells, and the extrodinary cast here--go play in Italy!!!! I take a vacation everytime I watch this.",

The entire rollerball aspect isn't even noticeable, and had I not known the name of the movie and just turned it on, it never would have occurred to me it's even SUPPOSED to be about rollerball. That's a dead giveaway something is seriously wrong.The evil side of me wanted to see the people riding down the highways to actually get hit by one of the many vehicles because at least going to the hospital would have provided a more enticing concept than whatever kind of crap the writers were attempting here.There is no storyline whatsoever. It's completely missing. If it's there I sure as heck couldn't find it. What a terrible waste of my time. It brings me comfort knowing I'm the 50th person giving it a 1-star review.

    "review/text": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has a fascinating career slump, dating the origins of its downfall for many years. The company used to be the king of producing movies, or at least it and Warner Bros. saw eye-to-eye, but the trouble began once Ted Turner bought the majority of the MGM library in the mid-1980s. And then in the mid-90s, MGM started heading down the quality crapper with the release of \"Showgirls\", a movie I personally thought was enjoyable but I had to acknowledge the critical lashing the film had. From then on, it kept a consistent record of producing below-average movies, with very few non-UA movies worth praising; not even the recent James Bond movies (sans \"Casino Royale\") helped them with their downward slope. As of now, the once-roaring studio is in financial trouble and in danger of being bankrupt (despite being sold to multiple companies), so what films did it accomplish in recent years? \"Soul Plane\", \"College\", \"The Mod Squad\", \"Sleep Over\", \"Good Boy\", \"Jiminy Glick in Lalawood\", \"Fame\" remake...and this movie, \"Rollerball\". What can I say, at least they had \"Barbershop\".I'm on the defense to say this isn'tthe worst of the worst, but if this movie expected for me to accept a dystopian world where corrupt businessmen are using this sport as a global-televised sensation, then it had another thing coming. It's glorified roller derby, for goodness sake, and the way it was set-up is impractical. This sport had a pretty small field of play, no bigger than a regular skating rink. Since many players had to fill in the stage, it would be pretty cluttered to watch and to experience, and this sport is suppose to include skateboarders AND motorcyclists. Do you know how crazy is it to ride a motorcycle in a small area surrounded by other players? There's no way one can drive fast and maneuver around the field without running over the majority of players; although logic like that seem dismissible in this film since one biker manage to run over a player and he didn't get seriously injured. And what are the rules of this game, besides hitting a metal ball at a goalpost? The film's final act decided not to have any rules, but I didn't know what the rules were to begin with; the chubby announcer in the film hadn't any idea what to make of this sport either.Even if I'm just humoring the premise, I can't deal with the film taking obnoxious lengths to be edgy. For this movie to be edgy, every character has to be cocky and insulting each other (this is par for every sport, though), they have to wear spikes and other ridiculous get-ups (with the girls wearing dominatrix attire), the largely heavy metal soundtrack had to blast Slipknot and Rob Zombie whenever it can, and there has to be lots of jump cuts whenever the action occurs. It tried too hard to be extreme that the film reached the point of pretentiousness.And then there's the plot, which has \"The Running Man\" written all over it. Chris Klein is the lead hot-shot, LL Cool J is the black partner, and Rebecca Romijn is the fanservice; they're part of an elite team of the popular sport, which is controlled by Jean Reno, and once they know how corrupt the sport is, they planned to fight their way out. The lack of any exposition is what nearly destroyed this movie. Somehow, everyone knows what's going on and where to go at particular moments without being told, so a lot of events just happened out of change. There's too many characters and the film didn't bother to establish most of them, and often times it pulled random conveniences out of its edgy behind (i.e., how that one character manages to steal the locker key off of some other character without showing it).The convoluted, inexplicable plot and the obnoxious hardcore attitude about itself made \"Rollerball\" almost unenjoyable. I say 'almost', because I admit in enjoying the climax of the film, which had some tension and it wasn't boring (plus, I have a thing foruprisingconclusions); plus, the whole desert sequence shot in night-vision was certainly new, if a bit of an odd design choice. But there are better movies out there follow this kind of dangerous premise and it's best to see those instead, like\"Death Race\".",

    "review/text": "Several masters of action film have fallen prey to the undisciplined chaos of post-MTV, music-video-style editing and filmmaking. Tony Scott's Spy Game was one, but that film at least had the star power of Robert Redford and Brad Pitt to rescue it. Rollerball, on the other hand, has no redeeming features -- it is easily the worst film in John McTiernan's oeuvre.Which is sad, because McTiernan's resume is an astonishing one: Predator, Die Hard, Die Hard with a Vengeance, The Hunt for Red October. Even his worst film up to now, Last Action Hero, was better than the mess that is Rollerball. From the beginning, it's clear that this film has no interest whatsoever in characterization and pacing. It simply thrusts you into sequence after sequence of undisciplined chaos. Who is main character Jonathan Cross? Who is his buddy? You still won't have a clue 30 minutes into the film, and that's about 20 minutes too late. Too much loud music, messy dialogue editing, use of pointless and ugly jump cuts, and hyperactive camera work conspire to make Rollerball an even bigger migraine than Swordfish...and that's saying a lot. Handheld camera is an overrated device indeed, and in the case of Rollerball, there are so many characters onscreen at a time that you'll find yourself desperately straining to figure out who's saying what, who is the focal point, and what exactly is going on. The overall feeling is that this film was shot in pure handheld-coverage style, the filmmakers simply mashing all the actors together in a location and then shooting endless amounts of film, without preplanning as to how it would all cut together. Call this modern filmmaking, but I'd take the razor-precision of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and Top Gun any day.Matched with the stylistic anarchy is a cast of characters who mostly behave like animals or clowns. There's not a single recognizable human trait in these characters; their motivations and behaviour are outlandishly cartoonish, without the entertaining factor.What happened? I believe that action masters like McTiernan and Scott may have been led down this undesireable path by all the young Turks springing up from music-video backgrounds to do features. Unfortunately, as in the case of Rollerball, Swordfish, Gone in 60 Seconds, The Replacement Killers, this style is a true atrocity to action filmmaking. I hope Scott, McTiernan and others realize this and stick to their guns, or we can say goodbye to action movies.",

    "review/text": "Rollerball is a remake of a 1975 science fiction film of the same name that only succeeds in showing what the world would be like if the XFL had become the rage. With how many problems this movie had in production, it was a surprise to see it touch theatres.Chris Klein, LL Cool J, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos all phone in their roles as rollerbladers in a high stakes game that is televised worldwide. The cookie-cutter nemesis is played by Jean Reno as the owner and general manager of the tournaments. And with John McTiernan (director of Die Hard) at the helm, the whole thing is unexcusable. It looks like he is well past his prime.In the original, the hard-core sport of Rollerball was a way for the ruling government of the world to show that individual effort was useless and futile, and only ended in death. In this unworthy remake, the ruling corporations are replaced by managers of the game with no other motive than to get higher ratings and greater profits.This action disaster takes no hints from it's predecessor. The James Caan version was timeless, using classical music to keep the movie from being dated and holding the action with a very well-done sci-fi backstory. This is a movie filled with pop music that doesn't even fit the action and a barely-there plot that is filled with unnecessary car races and entirely unexciting action scenes.The game consists of rolling around a figure eight track with the help of rollerblades and teammates on motorcycles, trying to beat the other team by throwing a steel ball into a large gong. Unlike the strategy and planning that went into the original's gameplay, this version looks like a circus. The action is filled with slapstick falls and dubbed-in lines with the actors not even openning their mouths. Somehow it manages to be entirely unexciting, with even the announcer looking bored and immersed on and off. Spills look entirely unrealistic and overplayed, while music completely unfitting the action drones loudly. Costumes look like chromed rejects from cirque de solei, with oversized helmets looking downright silly. All in all, for a movie named after a game, no thought was put in and these are the worst parts of the movie.The plot jumps from here to there constantly with characters changing their standings instantly; leaving the viewer without a clue as to anyone's personality. To bring the movie up to an R rating after it's PG-13 theatrical run, unnecessary bare breasts and dubbed-in language have been placed rampantly. Cinematography during the action sequences is indecipherable, with horrible editing added in.By the time you get to the car chase filmed in night-vision and textbook face-off at the end, you realize some movies are great on their own and don't need an updating - they are great as they are. Do yourself a favor and pick up the original for a great action-science-ficiton romp that has brains and brawn.",

    "review/text": "I'll keep it short and simple.At least for me, there are moments in life that redefine pain and pleasure. A point that you can use to envy or be thankful for. Like if you won the lottery. I'm sure that every good thing that happened to you from then on would be slightly paler in comparison. You might get a free bun from cinabon and think, \"Mmmm, this is a good bun...but it's not as good as that one time I won the lottery.Rollerball is the opposite of winning the lottery. If the lottery was where once a year someone was picked to get puched in the face on world-wide television, and one year it happened to be you, the feeling you would get of dread and unjustice would be close to how it feels to watch Rollerball. Rollerball redefined pain for me. Last month I had a horrible case of the stomach flu and spent most of 2 days staring into the toilet. During that time I was seriously thankful that at least I wasn't watching Rollerball.I guess that is at least one benefit of the movie, and justifies it getting one star. Now all the bad things that happen to me don't seem to be that bad anymore. Car Accident? Well at least I'm not watching Rollerball...Pet Died? At least the pet is in a place where I am sure this movie does not exist...Forget to pay the rent and get kicked out of your appartment? You get the picture.Money spent on paying someone to physically harm you is money better spent than buying Rollerball. Because Rollerball hurts you in more ways :(",

    "review/text": "This remake could better be understood and appreciated if one looks at it as a \"prequel\" rather than a \"remake\". The original Rollerball is set in the far future in a 1984ish society, were as the \"remake\" is set only 3 years in the future (more or less it is happening right now), were the keystones of corporate society are just beginning to be set by globalization. And as you know in the \"real world,\" two of the main players of globalization in the Middle East and Central Asia is the Red Mafia and Islamdom, which of coarse are dependent on Rollerball in the \"remake\" for their wealth. Yes, there are differences in the two versions. Rollerball in the \"remake/prequel\" is like most novelty sports (XFL, WWF, NWO, X-Games); the players are social rejects (criminals, psychotics, Goths, thrill seekers, or athletes from mainstream sports that play too rough), it is a coed sport (so much in this sport, that the leader of the Istanbul Hawks is a woman, despite representing an Islamic State: note continual footage of the woman with the sunglasses), heavy rock music being played, uniforms that represent individual personalities, it serves as a front for gambling and other criminal enterprises, and is (officially) non-lethal. Rollerball in the \"original,\" is played by respected and law-abiding individuals, it is for men only, the music played is classical or at least contemporary classical, uniforms are well....uniformed, the sport replaces war as the chief vehicle of socially acceptable violence in an \"One-Nation World\", and there is no denying that the game's lethality is the whole point of the game! The key is you need to see where two movie overlap outside of having the same title. At the start of the film, you have Global leaders visiting Petrovich, with an interest in expanding this Islamo-Soviet sport ; are these people the founders of Energy Inc? The game, in the prequel, for the first time, changes its rules; in the original film, the Houston coach mentioned that the game has had numerous changes, but was still the same game (obviously two of those rule changes did away with female players and personalized outfits,). So is Jonathan E actually Jonathan Cross? Is Jonathan E.'s estranged wife Aurora? In a Special Edition Version of Jewison's Rollerball, will you have La Guillotine digitally added to Team New York (another rule change, no team nicknames), to add to the mayhem? Will Chopin and Stravinsky replace Rob Zombie and Pink as Rollerball musicians? Probably no, no, no, and yes. But could it be true that an unknown Pay-Per-View Sport becomes society's answer to it's ills 100 years from now, yes.",

    "review/text": "In this terrible remake of 1975 film, Jean Reno plays an \"evil\" owner and manager of violent sports (or entertainment if you like) called \"Rollerball.\" Just like a cross between rollerskating and ice hockey, people all over the world are excited watching the thrilling games - well, he wants it that way. No enters Chris Klein's character that soon becomes a new hero of the circuit, but he realizes that some heinous plot is going on when one of his teammates got heavily injured by receiving a big iron ball in the face.Well, that is the film's story, sort of. Actually, nothing really makes sense in those badly edited \"game scenes\" where players are seen hitting each other rollerskating, and motorcycles with howling engines stumbling on the rink (and one of the riders is beautiful Rebecca Romijn-Stamos from \"X-Men\" but you cannot recognize her ... again.) To be honest, I had no idea of what is going on and I'm afraid you won't either. Rules? Sorry, I thought there was an introductory part about them, but I stopped caring as the film got more and more incredible.The original \"Rollerball\" a cult film by Norman Jewison, knew what it wanted by drawing the bleak vision of our near future and its actions are still refreshing and exciting to see. But this remake most unaccountably ignores the tone of the original's futuristic society and stays content just showing meaninglessly violent stunts. The film remains pointless throughout I thought as it has no drama not even a decent story and no character. The game scenes look terribly bland. In fact they look dull compared with what we can see on some cable TV programs.To be fair, there are some good action scenes like opening skateboarding race or bike chasing in the midnight. But strangely they have virtually nothing to with the premise of the film, game of the title. Chris Klein is good and Jean Reno is just OK, but the latter's charisma seen in such great films as \"The Professional\" cannot be found here. And most strangely this thrill-free film is directed by John Mcteirnan of thrilling action film \"Die Hard.\"",

    "review/text": "The original Rolerball and this 2002 remake have recently been making the rounds on cable-TV. Simply, putting sequel up against the original is like comparing the XFL to the NFL.The remake is simply dreadful, with a poor script, equally poor casting and a gimmicky figure-eight track with tunnels & sidetracks which is played on rollerblades - with other team members on motorcycles - and goals scored with the metal ball. Based in central Asia, the game becomes increasingly violent to boost TV ratings - especially in America - and to make for growing fan interest.It takes the anticorporate stance of Jonathon E and morphs him into outlaw exteme sports lover Jonathon Cross (Chris Klein), who ultimately leads the players and fans in a revolt against the senseless violence pushed by sport founder Alexi Petrovich (Jean Reno) and the networks. Sounds like a bad WWE storyline, and that may be why motormouth Paul Heyman is the \"announcer\" for the games. I was waiting for Heyman to belt out, \"It's Extreme,\" several hundred times.Put LL Cool J, who plays an old friend of Cross and the person who gets him involved in the game, in the lead role and he may have saved the character from being absolutely unbelievebale. Perhaps putting Heyman as the evil entrepreneur may have made for a more sinister Petrovich.And slowing the cinema-photography down from its rapid cuts may have forced editors to let the story speak volumes like the original. But in the end, Rollerball is a poor attempt in updating a movie that didn't need it.",

    "review/text": "Most of the classic science-fiction, horror movies of the late sixties/mid-seventies were message movies: They were parables, allegorical yarns influencing us to confront the fallacies of our society.&quot;Silent Running&quot;, &quot;Planet of The Apes&quot;, &quot;Omega Man&quot;, &quot;Soilent Green&quot;, &quot;Night of The Living Dead&quot;, &quot;Logan's Run&quot;; each of these movies touched on the negative trends of contemporary society, be it racism, crass-consumerism, generational gaps, ecological suicide... In short, Man's inhumanity to Man.The original &quot;Rollerball&quot; showed us the global corporate culture of the near future. It threw society's sick obsession with both sports and violence right at our faces. The bloodlust that was in the fictional future's rollerball audience was only slightly little different from the real life demands young white men were making at that time of the then emerging sport of Ice Hockey.The age of the Nation-State was over and the multinational corporation, who was the new totalitarian aggroprop motivator, was now ascendent. We no longer had to worry about ideologues but PR men telling you what, when and where to buy. Control through the supply and demand for consumer goods and pastimes.Humankind still had an aggression complex: a need for one man to hurt -and yes even kill!- his fellow man. How does the Multinational Global Corporations contain, yet satisfy, this bloodlust (and at the same time further stupify an already flabby, dumbed-down populace)? ROLLERBALL. All the fastpaced, adrenaline inducing, death and maiming and scarring of WAR, shrunken down and sealed up into a tiny arena, starting and ending at precise times.Sad. Hateful. However, like all those aforementioned movies did, showing a reflection of us: Modern, secular, selfish, self-gratifying Humanity.2002's &quot;Rollerball&quot; instead of updating and furthering this warning/message, is rather just another example and prop of our malaise as a immature, gratification addicted species. No true message. Just bright lights, loud noise, hitech special effects and shallowness. The writers and artists have become just as negative and selfish as the lumpen.It is because of movies such as this that I was putoff when I heard that there was talk of making remakes of &quot;Logan's Run&quot; and &quot;Omega Man&quot;. When the respective stars being considered for these intended remakes are Leonardo Di Caprio and Arnold Schwartzenneger I easily imagine Hollywood rendering these beloved classics into meaningless, mindless action/thriller schlock and junk. All shoot-em-ups, chases, and silly countdowns to explosive fireworks. Leaving no commitment or involvement from the theatre audience but laughter and cheers. No reflections. No introspections. No learning. No morality.Hollywood, please leave the films of a better, more compassionate, more intelligent era alone. You can satisfy the mob you pander to without remakes. Thin plots, involving one-dimensional characters, speeding through long scenes of T&amp;A, mindless violence and numbing special effects will more than satisfy your market and bring in all the revenue you lust for. Desecrating art is not necessary.",

I equate this movie to Coyote Ugly, it's not bad if you're willing to just let your mind go.The plot is pretty straight forward: Johnathon Cross, and extreme sports junkie, is persuaded by a friend to play Rollerball, a cross between soccer, rollerblading, and anything goes that's being played in Asia. He becomes the start player for his team, enjoys all the perks, including getting cozy with a fellow teammate, and then discovers that the owners of the teams are staging fights and accidents to boost ratings. His conscience kicks in, and he tries to find a way to stop it.The special effects in the movie are nice, they scenes are patched together so it really looks like they're playing the game, flying through the air, and doing a bunch of stunts. The costumes are flashy, everyone has their own unique style, from a gladiator down to someone in a tutu. Everything is done in a flashy way, with lots of sparks or flashy lights.The soundtrack fits the movie, there's hard rock for the games and parties and slower music for other scenes. The Rob Zombie song is well picked, it fits in with the style of the movie. What I liked best about the music is that you didn't really notice it, there weren't points that stood out and made you go \"Why on earth did they pick that piece?\"Overall I'd give it 3 stars. The first is for the music, it was appropriate. The second star is for the costumes and set design, it really made the movie more substantial, although not by much. And, the third star would be for a simple plot that's hard to screw up. Rollerball isn't the next great movie, but it's one that can be fun to watch if you let your brain go.",

The rollerball game itself has been turned from it's original rollerderby/football hybrid into a jumbled mess.John McTiernan should have had his name removed from this film and replaced with Alan Smithee.Hard to believe this came from the director of PREDATOR, DIE HARD, and THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, three superlative action films.I don't feel like going into too much detail, because just thinking back on this movie is painful for me.Periodically, you'll see a movie that has had too many \"creative hands\" in it. Plot lines and other elements were changed or created to please focus groups, principle photography began before a script was completed, or the whole project was initiated simply because the studio was SURE it had a built-in audience.Film students learn on day one of Filmmaking 101 that even if you have all the right ingredients, that alone isn't enough to make a good movie. There also has to be respect for the source material, good acting and directing, and cooperation between the director, the producers, and the studio. With ROLLERBALL, everything seemed to go wrong. EVERYTHING!Rollerturkey!",

    "review/text": "`Rollerball' is a god-awful remake of the 1975 Norman Jewison film about a fictional sport in which murdering the players becomes a primary object of the game. The original film acquired what little credibility it had by setting the story sometime in the distant future. This version is set in the present, but it tries to maintain its believability by locating the league in Southwest Asia, under the parochial assumption, I suppose, that that part of the world is every bit as alien, exotic and dehumanized as any hypothetical future society. It doesn't work. It is simply impossible for us to believe even for a split second that the owners and promoters of this sport would think they could get away with such murderous shenanigans broadcast live to millions of viewers the world over. Might not the United Nations, among other international organizations, have a thing or two to say about all this? Also, will someone please explain to me just WHAT purpose is served by having the promoters of this sport killing off their own players? Doesn't that sort of deplete their own resources for future games? I can't imagine too many people willingly signing on to engage in this sort of gladiatorial tomfoolery.Even if we agreed to swallow the whole thing merely for the sake of the entertainment value of the film, we would be forced to admit that `Rollerball' is a chintzy, clunky, uninteresting movie in all respects. The sport itself - sort of a cross between motor cross racing, roller derby, hockey and basketball - is completely unexciting, consisting of little more than blurred figures racing madly around a cramped, claustrophobic track. Without even the context of good action sequences, `Rollerball' is forced to fall back on its dialogue and characters, which proves to be disastrous for all concerned. Chris Klein, in the role of hotshot Jonathon Cross - played by James Caan in the original - comes across as a minor league version of Keanu Reeves. LL Cool J is wasted in the part of Jonathon's American sidekick, and poor Jean Reno gets to play one of the most laughable villains we've run across in a movie in a long long long long time.In fact, this redux turns out to be good for nothing BUT a few hearty laughs. If you are in need of such, check out `Rollerball.' It's a real hoot.",

    "review/text": "This remake could better be understood and appreciated if one looks at it as a \"prequel\" rather than a \"remake\". The original Rollerball is set in the far future in a 1984ish society, were as the \"remake\" is set only 3 years in the future (more or less it is happening right now), were the keystones of corporate society are just beginning to be set by globalization. And as you know in the \"real world,\" two of the main players of globalization in the Middle East and Central Asia is the Red Mafia and Islamdom, which of coarse are dependent on Rollerball in the \"remake\" for their wealth. Yes, there are differences in the two versions. Rollerball in the \"remake/prequel\" is like most novelty sports (XFL, WWF, NWO, X-Games); the players are social rejects (criminals, psychotics, Goths, thrill seekers, or athletes from mainstream sports that play too rough), it is a coed sport (so much in this sport, that the leader of the Istanbul Hawks is a woman, despite representing an Islamic State: note continual footage of the woman with the sunglasses), heavy rock music being played, uniforms that represent individual personalities, it serves as a front for gambling and other criminal enterprises, and is (officially) non-lethal. Rollerball in the \"original,\" is played by respected and law-abiding individuals, it is for men only, the music played is classical or at least contemporary classical, uniforms are well....uniformed, the sport replaces war as the chief vehicle of socially acceptable violence in an \"One-Nation World\", and there is no denying that the game's lethality is the whole point of the game! The key is you need to see where two movie overlap outside of having the same title. At the start of the film, you have Global leaders visiting Petrovich, with an interest in expanding this Islamo-Soviet sport ; are these people the founders of Energy Inc? The game, in the prequel, for the first time, changes its rules; in the original film, the Houston coach mentioned that the game has had numerous changes, but was still the same game (obviously two of those rule changes did away with female players and personalized outfits,). So is Jonathan E actually Jonathan Cross? Is Jonathan E.'s estranged wife Aurora? In a Special Edition Version of Jewison's Rollerball, will you have La Guillotine digitally added to Team New York (another rule change, no team nicknames), to add to the mayhem? Will Chopin and Stravinsky replace Rob Zombie and Pink as Rollerball musicians? Probably no, no, no, and yes. But could it be true that an unknown Pay-Per-View Sport becomes society's answer to it's ills 100 years from now, yes.",

    "review/text": "Well, most of the people here are ripping this movie pretty good. One of the most glaring things that I noticed was the poor editing job; there are several instances where it looks like one of those old silent films where one minute a character is one place and another minute a character is another place. It is amazing to find that kind of thing happen these days in movies. Still, I think this movie had some potential. It was a relatively good action movie that used the corruptability of sports and ratings as its main theme. The basic premise is that in order to get ratings powerful sports organizers are willing to do anything, including sometimes brutal accidents, to achieve this. You may choose to look at this as a stab at what we do in America today (such as reality type television), or you may take it to \"glamourize\" this type of action (which I do not think the producers were trying to do). The lack of star power and script really hurts this movie, however. Also, it is overdone with a soundtrack that is seemingly never ending. I would venture to guess that half of the movie has music blaring in it during the action scenes. (It is fine to have a soundtrack, but you do not need to make the music the movie.) Overall, although this was not a good movie, I certainly do not think it was \"the worst\" movie you will ever see. Still, there are glaring problems with this movie that the average moviegoer will detect readily. For this reason, I give this movie 2 stars.",

I don't think there was a dry eye in the house, everyone was laughing their collective [rears] off at this movie's horrible editing and lack of...well...movie. Let's start off -- any movie with LL Cool J (with the exception of Any Given Sunday) automatically sucks. Add to that Chris Klein (who was decent in American Pie and excellent in Election), who just isn't cut out for action roles. Instead of droning on, I'm going to list the best parts of the movie:(1) Infamous night vision scene where LL and Klein are being chased around by evil dudes, for NO APPARENT REASON. Looks like it's being filmed on VHS. All of a sudden they drive through a barb wire fence and the \"BOOOIIINNNGG\" sound effect (like in old cartoons) is played. This was the highlight of the movie.(2) Amazing editing, where someone will be turning their head or walking, and then all of a sudden appear somewhere else. rock and roll!(3) Pink's \"Acting Debut\"...except for the fact that she only appeared on a tv in the background of one scene for one second, lip synching to a song that wasn't even hers...I think it was a Rob Zombie song or something(4) Rebecca Romajin Stamos: her fake ...russian accent is hilarious, as is her scene where she's lifting weights topless, FOR NO REASON. apparently chicks do that all the time. Also, her final line in the movie is classic. I won't spoil it for you.In summary, check out this movie...I haven't watched the DVD version yet but if it's unchanged from it's theatrical counterpart, then you're in for an excellent unintentional comedy. I can't wait to see the deleted scenes in this movie...if they [were] even WORSE than the actual movie itself, then I won't know what to do with myself. This is one of those movies where it's so bad that it's entertaining (like Fast and the Furious, only worse!)",

So the only things in common between the two films are the name and the fact a ball rolls around a rink in a violent sport.If one can disassociate the first film from this one, then this version can actually be fun. In a brief synopsis, the star rollerballer in a central asian ring discovers that the league ownership is manipulating television ratings by staging violent scenes on the rink. When he and a fellow American (played adequately by LL Cool J) decide to save their own necks by fleeing to the boarder, they are hunted down by the Russian thugs before they can make good their escape. The inclusion of a Dutch motorcyclist, played by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, provided the movie with a love interest.The final game is a bit unrealistic as the wounded star, played by Chris Klein who surprisingly looks like a junior Keanu Reeves, stays alive on the rink long enough to confront his opponents in the front office.All in all, better than I expected, as long as I kept in mind it was not the same as the original.",

    "review/text": "This 2002 remake of an old classic ranks among other blockbuster flops like \"Battlefield Earth\" and \"Waterworld.\" It's the future and huge corporations control most of Earth. The one thing that keeps humanity together is Rollerball, a sport that is a mix of hockey, rollerblading, and pro wrestling. Paul Heyman is the announcer for Rollerball, proving that it is never a good thing to have a commentator with an annoying voice for your sport. Chris Klein is John, a young hot-shot who is learning fast that Rollerball is a tough \"sport.\" He soon discovers that the corporations control everything that happens in the game. Okay, this is a boring film, lost in an emptiness that serves as a grave for the makers' credibility. Even excellent actor Jean Reno does little in the way of making this movie even remotely interesting. It is a monotonous, unexciting flop, a plaigerized version of the fun James Caan film.",

    "review/text": "Sports fans probably remember Fox Sports Net's series of commercials a year or two ago, advertising the new \"Regional Sports Reports\". These spots featured absurd imaginary sports being played in some dry and dusty location which looked vaguely Central Asian. The tag line was, \"sports news from the only region you care about --- yours.\"This new version of Rollerball looks like it was taken from one of those FSN commercials. Gone is the SF storyline of the original story. Rather than set the story in the future, the film makers transposed it to Central Asia in the present day, post-Soviet world.The game vaguely resembles the original Rollerball, but is so hastily edited and poorly choreographed that nothing of what made the original game so compelling remains. It's just blow stuff up. Instead of drama, you get bashed in faces. In fact, although there's plenty of mindless action, there's actually less game footage than in the original... and less action.Jean Reno delivers a terrible performance as the capitalist mogul who is (gasp!) deliberately cranking up the violence in the game for (gasp!) higher ratings. With the wretched script he's given, he could hardly be expected to fill the shoes of the role played by John Houseman, the icy corporate chief of the original.As for Chris Klein... Granted, he doesn't have much of a script to work with, but I still found his performance annoying. I've seen him do better work (\"Election\") but he doesn't project the kind of screen presence James Caan did in the original.Curiously, although the script dispenses with the science fiction background, it does have men and women playing on the same team, and showering in co-ed locker rooms. I seriously doubt there is a culture anywhere on Earth today where men and women would participate in full contact sports together, let alone get undressed in the same locker room. There would have to be some very intense social upheaval to make that happen, particularly in Central Asia, which is a fairly conservative part of the world.If you thought \"Replicant\" was a great movie, then you might like this one; but frankly, folks, Chris Klein's performance makes Jean Claude van Damme look like Olivier. In fact even \"Replicant\" is mildly more interesting than this new \"Rollerball\". At least van Damme can do the splits.",

    "review/summary": "Why You Should See This Movie......",
    "review/text": "I remember seeing the original James Caan film on then-network television. The anti-corporate culture of the 1960s had been beaten down, so a film about a &quot;central&quot; corporation running the world was a novelty (well--novel to me at that time). Plus, I loved roller derby (ask your grandparents what that is), and Rollerball had lots of action--but no Raquel Welch, like in Kansas City Bomber (unfortunately)--but not all that weepy, overwrought emotion--like in Kansas City Bomber (which was fortunate). Heck, when you start with one of the better &quot;B&quot; movies of all time, how hard can a remake be?Apparently, it's really, really hard. Other reviews here can give you the gut feeling that this movie stinks (and lord have mercy--it's a stinker), but there are specific reasons why this movie misses so badly. First &amp; foremost--If you're going to make a movie about a &quot;game,&quot; you might want to explain what the &quot;game&quot; is &amp; then be roughly consistent with the game. If I had not seen the James Caan version, I'd have no idea what &quot;rollerball&quot; was from watching this movie. Then, as the &quot;rules&quot; changed in this film, it becomes impossible to follow what is happening during the game. What's on the screne just makes no sense at all. Even in classic roller derby, you had &quot;jammers&quot; who scored points between the fights &amp; &quot;interviews&quot; (find the oldest person you know &amp; ask them to explain it to you--if they can).Second, I don't know if it's a question of style, but this film features zillions of tight close-ups of action, with most of the &quot;action&quot; happening outside the frame. Think of a boxing match, and during a jab to the jaw, the frame is filled with the elbow of the guy getting hit--And you don't know if it's boxing, arm wrestling, or My Dinner with Andre. Plus, the camera shakes a lot as well--just in case you might be on the verge of understanding what's going on. It's like the cheapest monster movie you've ever seen, where instead of buying a big rubber suit for the monster, the director points the camera at some object behind the actor's back &amp; shakes the camera to show something is happening.Next, there are no characters. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is sometimes the strong, silent John Wayne-type (you'd think that would be Chris Klein's role, but you'd be wrong), and then weepy &amp; clingy--for no apparent reason. She has this &quot;now-you-see-it, now-you-don't&quot; scar on her face that upsets her sometimes--who knows why; The Duke never got weepy about his marks. She also lifts weights topless in total darkness--successfully pissing off everyone who doesn't want a nude scene &amp; really pissing off everyone hoping for some hint of a nude scene as a consolation prize. What kind of an &quot;R&quot; rated movie is this? Ms. Romijn is a talented actor (I guess that's why she married John: opposites attract), but the statute in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; had more to work with than she has in this turkey...Chris Klein is terrible--even if he had something to work with (which he doesn't). To call LL Cool J's character &quot;two dimensional&quot; is an insult to the depth of two-dimensional characters everywhere. Jean Reno's part (he's the George Steinbrenner of Rollerball) just doesn't make any sense. No one else even exists in this movie--they just zip through like a big flock of faceless black birds.Ultimately, this movie is just random bits of crap spliced together, abandoning all hope of logic or story. To give you an idea of just how disjointed this film is, at one point (don't ask why--trust me, if I explained it, you'd be way sorry), Mr. Klein &amp; Mr. Cool J are running away from the Rollerball &quot;Circus,&quot; and Jean Reno is chasing them. For an inordinately long time, we see the scene in some kind of &quot;night vision&quot; photography. The protagonists race motorcycles towards a bridge, while being shot at, and the bridge explodes. The &quot;night vision&quot; stops, and we are back to Jean Reno and his gunmen. Who was using the night vison? Maybe Mr. Reno's gunman who haa a high power rifle with a scope--only it's now daylight. If you have to ask why gunmen use &quot;night vision&quot; scopes during the day--you should watch another movie.But--as I asked at the beginning--why should you see this movie? I'll tell you. You watch a scene, and think &quot;Wow. That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen.&quot; Then comes the next scene, and you think &quot;Holy cats! That was even dumber than the last scene!&quot; And after the next scene, you think &quot;Jeez Louise! A new record in dumb&quot; And the scene after that you think &quot;O.K. Now *that* had to be the dumbest scene ever.&quot; But the next scene is even worse! How long can the director (John McTiernan) keep this up? [...]",

It pretty much lost my attention after that. It did however get my attention again when Slipknot made a cameo which was pretty cool.The only thing I'd say Rollerball had going for it was the stars of the movie, Chris Klein, LL Cool J, Robecca Romijn-Stamos, former UFC Champ Oleg &quot;The Russian Bear&quot; Taktarov and the WWE's Paul Heyman. Other than that, very little. In my opinion, the action in the movie became less and less as the movie progressed.This was supposed to be a big summer block bluster and instead it was a let down.

It's not really fair to call this a remake of the 1975 version, which is good in its own rights. This takes the basic premise of the Rollerball game, but instead of being set in some futuristic sci-fi world, it places the game in our current time. Now that the Soviet Union has broken up into independent countries, men who were powerful under the Soviet government still seek to remain in power. Rollerball team owners are incredibly powerful men - men who are not willing to give up the trappings of power. They use their power with impunity, resorting to extortion, force, threats to accomplish their goals.The pace can become fast and furious. Much as if this were a real sport, the movie is cut with the style that would be appreciated by afficianados of this sort of sport - similar to the way professional wrestling is marketed. The fast cuts, choppy action, insertion of elements such as the player's trading cards, persistent music, all help focus on the experience that the Rollerball fans would relish.Chris Klein and L.L. Cool J are two Americans on a team based in Kazakstan (my apologies for any spelling errors). Their team travels to compete against teams in other Central Asian countries. When the TV ratings begin to drop, the team owners resort to any means possible to keep the ratings up. The methods used, in light of the political situation in that area of the world, are entirely plausible and believable. One should take note of the subtle ways that are used to control the team members.Although younger viewers may enjoy the action scenes and the music, more mature viewers will enjoy those plus the intrigue. I was already an adult when the original Rollerball was released, and I'm quite pleased with this version.",

    "review/text": "Rollerball still stands as a solid sci-fi flick about the fear of corporate society and the crushing of the little guy (you). Sadly, if you look around, we're slowly approaching it.Fast forward to now and we have yet another remake. With Rollerball (2002) I am now convinced that these remakes serve a functional purpose: to make the originals look like masterpieces. If there is another reason, I've yet to see it. At this point, I would be less insulted if Hollywood studios publicly declared: We have no ideas, we are bankrupt of original thoughts, so we'll just resell you the same thing, over and over.The sickest thing about John McTiernan's Rollerball remake is that it had potential. The original film took place in a sterilized future world where corporations had taken the place of nations, society had everything it needed, and the main distraction for the pesty public was the ultraviolent sport of rollerball. Jonathan E began to meddle by somehow surviving the sport year after year and began to shine, which is exactly what the corporations did NOT want. The sport was to prove the futility of individual effort.In the remake, the setting is the near future, but the concerns are not global like the original. Rollerball is more a fringe sport (like Slamball, or Arena Football, or backyard wrestling) operating out of central Asia (any of the '-stan' countries of the old Soviet empire.) For the miserable masses who slave in mines, the sport, which is less coherent here than the original film, provides a distraction from their meaningless lives (sort of like all sports do, anyway.)I did like this idea for the setting, making rollerball a regional interest rather than global phenomenon. It actually makes it more realistic, and indeed there are references to WWE wrestling, which it resembles in the glitzy pageantry and shameless profiteering. This, along with other elements, are wasted in the ensuing chaos.An NHL draftee (Chris Klein, doing a career Keanu impersonation that is frightening) flees the USA because he's been busy illegally body-boarding down San Fran streets and runs off with LL Cool J to play for big money in the rollerball leauge. The (naturally) evil team owner is Jean Reno, who covets more and more ratings by getting rid of rules, penalties, and other pesty elements of the sport that prevent people from dying. This is all to satisfy some kind of global ratings meter that is instant and will gauge who is tuning in when.I could go on and on about this film. It was famously plagued during post-production (not to mention pre-production, production, and the 'idea', casting, and all other phases.) The film is incoherent, plain and simple. What you would call a mess.It is highly recommended to bad movie buffs the world over. I picked this baby up at a 2-for-$15 sale--that's less than the cost of seeing this clinker in the theater! The DVD wisely throws in many extras to entice you and to give you something approaching value after you realize how appalling the film is.The other recommendation is to buy the original Rollerball on DVD, also a good value.I now heartily endorse remakes like this one, as I'm sure Norman Jewison (director of the original) does. His film and his career shine that much brighter after atrocities like this.",

    "review/text": "With this movie, the intention of John McTiernan, a director yet known for his great effectiveness (remember \"Predator\", \"Die Hard 1 & 3\", \"The Hunt for Red October\", \"The 13th Warrior\"), was attack the worlds of medias and reality-shows in the U.S. But he completely fails. His film, the second in his career 'remade' from Norman Jewison - after \"Thomas Crown\" - actually uses all the fashioned cliches of American action movies: all the scenes were shot and edited at 100 mph, in the MTV style (the musical background is unstandable). We have the impression to deal with a \"Fast and Furious\" on skates. The story doesn't have any slice of interest, and the too cool acting (especially LL Cool J's - 'Close your eyes and take the dough!') and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos disastrous Russian accent don't arrange anything. But what may be really shocking in this film is the presence of a woman in the games, which is really unacceptable when you see the great violence of this sport, mixing football, baseball, boxing and ice hockey, and where (maybe for the beauty of the show...) almost no blow is forbidden. There is no woman football or ice hockey league (so far...), but you can see a woman playing rollerball... look for the mistake! And McTiernan definitely turned his movie to politically correct, by locating the rollerball games in a poor country in central Asia.Add to it this French actor, Jean Reno, who absolutely doesn't belong in here and ridiculizes himself more than anything else and you have a zero movie, one of the worse ever directed by McTiernan, maybe his worst, along with \"Medicine Man\". The advice I could give McTiernan is try to be more personal and independent, and to write screenplays of his own. What are the use and interest spending so much dough to produce things like this? The film was a big box-office failure and it's not surprising. A terrifying blunder. (Re)Watch 1975 Norman Jewison great classic instead.",

Does this sound like an audience clash of interest to you? Maybe that's why it didn't do so well. People who liked American Pie (especially the girls) for the most part, don't like Slipknot and Rob Zombie- and the same goes ten-fold for LL Cool J. The PG-13 version is the only one I saw, and while I have read numerous reviews of it being incredibly violent I only have this to say: No. Yes it was violent, but in the end, it earned a PG-13 rating. Judging from what I saw there, I would bet that this version is a bit more graphic but not enough so to give it more than an extra star. Klein, the director, was responsible for films such as &quot;Die Hard,&quot; which absolutely amazes me becaues the directing in this movie was awful. The camera clips and slows down in something that tries to be 'new' and 'cutting edge', but ends up being an eyesore.Why the heck would I want to see the guy from American Pie and LL Cool J in what's (supposedly) a violent and gritty action film?Your money is well spent else where.",

    "review/text": "Rollerball. In the original film, the game attempted to stand as an outlet of Corporation superiority; constantly demonstrating to the consumers (the people) that individuality is futile. Apparently, one does not have to either read the screenplay or physically watch the original film for there to be a remake. Decent director John McTiernan, who \"wow-ed\" me with such films as the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair as well as his early cult hits like Die Hard and Predator has obviously lost his ability to either A) do remakes or B) handle a camera with any sense of decency. If I was allowed one question to have answered through the course of my life, my question would be, \"What was the point of Rollerball the remake?\", and I do believe there would be answer from any higher authority. This film single handedly goes down in the record books as not just the worst remake to come out of Hollywood, but it is also a double threat, with it being in the top 100 of worst films ever conceived. It is embarrassing to say, but it has to be said, that Rollerball is one of a few select films that demonstrated no ability in the fields of direction, acting, cinematography, or writing. If Rollerball were deemed a student paper, it would have failed all four parts. Nothing, I repeat, nothing of value can be found with this film, and I even tried hard, but one must easily look at this film and simply state, \"It failed\".As I look at the description for this film through many web sites, I happen to notice that many times this film is classified as a \"science fiction\" film, which boggles my mind. There was absolutely nothing science fiction about this film outside of the possibility of the actual Rollerball game being a rather sci-fi-esque type game, but when you look at it, there is nothing special about the sport. The 1975 film version was extremely science fiction with its views on the future of our world, the surrounding environment, as well as subtly placed usage of the laser gun. Yet somehow, this 2002 version is able to call itself a \"science fiction\" merely on the premise that it takes place three years in the future. Three. Whole. Years. That to me is the staple of why this film corrupted from the inside out. The writing was atrocious to say the least. It felt as if the writers of this film, one Larry Ferguson or one John Pogue (odd, this horrid smelling filth of a film took two of Hollywood's scribes ... ouchers!), took random ideas, threw them together and attempted to create continuity in the course of 97 minutes. No doubtably procrastination was an issue, and to cut corners to meet a deadline these avid writers chose to cut characters, huge plot points, and any sort of solid stream of consciousness to create possibly the worst that Hollywood could ever offer. Nothing, in the form of script, plot, or action/adventure is worth mentioning in this film. I had difficulty enjoying the first one and it was a symbolic mess about the corporate hold on its consumers, while this filth had nothing to do with ... nothing. Words came out of the actor's mouths, but they meant nothing, they stood for nothing, and half the time it just had me laughing due to the staged words that they were dealt. Again, there was no value in this film.Chris Klein has ridden the shirt tales of American Pie for a very long time (I always saw him as the Weakest Link of those films), so he decided to take a leading man's role in Rollerball in hopes that he could transform his career into a leading man, but you can't make cardboard stand on his own. Could Chris have attempted to grow a backbone for this film ... is that possible? The words that came out of his mouth had no emotion; he was together with Rebecca Romijn-Stamos for purely the physical admiration, and someone needs to tell him that by squinting his eyes harder doesn't indicate that he is upset or angry. I cannot seem to shake the image of him riding with L.L. Cool J in the Russian night on a motorcycle using \"night vision\" for dramatic purposes, and Klein speaking unattached words out of my mind. It was hilarity on a grand scale. I remember the pair talking about something, but the laughter coming from my mouth was far more overpowering. Nothing (which seems to be the common theme of this film) is of value in this film. Klein proved that on more than one occasion. That isn't to say that those like LL, Jean Reno, Stamos, or even my favorite Naveen Andrews were any better. Klein led the pact with kindergarten acting skills, but Reno was completely over the top, which caused confusion as to who he was and why he was involved financially, Andrews was nothing more than filler, Stamos was used for the nudity ... that was all, and LL kept the \"hip-ness\" factor on a grander scale. Nobody demonstrated anything close to talent in this film and it ultimately boils down to the failure of decent director John McTiernan.Rollerball is one of those films that gives remakes a horrid name. Even if the original wasn't worth writing home to mother about, films of this stature only place a black scar on the future of remakes. I have to be worried about McTiernan because of my enjoyment of some of his past films and how anyone could see the final cut of this film and say, \"This is my best work yet!\" If you cannot say those words as you hand the final reel to the distribution company, I would reconsider the release. Writing was far worse that imaginable, the acting was nowhere to be seen, and the cinematography (something I didn't feel like going into too deeply with this review) felt as if it was done by those who are afraid of camera. Honestly, I have seen better amateur work than what Rollerball had to offer. Why is this film still being distributed? This is a very dark cloud amongst the Hollywood types and am very surprised to see that everyone is still able to acquire roles in Tinsel town after this disaster. My only wish is that future directors and actors actually take pride in their work instead of just allowing the paycheck to do the talking. Ignore this film or it will haunt you the rest of your life!Grade: * out of *****",

I should pause here to mention that even this low level of analysis lends this travesty too much creedence -- the script is pathetic, the acting nominal, the cinematography and direction are both quite shabby, and even the sound design is muddled and cluttered. To make things worse, if possible they write in the \"hero\" as a young, untouchable super-stud, rather than an aging jock whose skill and experience are only just barely enough to him fit for this dangerous new game.

    "review/text": "... but, gentle reader, I believe this movie is not the horror that the previous few reviewers thought it would be.To begin, John McTiernan doesn't faithfully redo classics. Instead, he changes them into a modern action film with modern concepts and modern values, and almost always with better than average, and often exceptional, characters. Think of the aforementioned \"Thomas Crowne Affair\": its plot had very little to do with the Norman Jewison version (oh, gee, who directed the 1975 version of \"Rollerball\"? I forget...). However, very similar sensibilities are there in the 1999 version.Hmm...FADE IN: Studio exec is trying to figure out what to do about his next production. Suddenly a lightbulb goes on over his head:STUDIO EXEC(to SECRETARY, O.S.)Call John McTiernan! Have him redo anotherNormal Jewison film. What else has that geezerdone?! (rifling through old DGA directory) (Beat)Rollerball!! Perfect!! Violence, fast-paced, slinkygirls, lots of stunts, loud music! Perfect!Maybe... Anyway, we now return to our original review.So when McT, as he refers to himself on other commentaries (one of my major disappointments about this so-called special edition is the lack of a McTiernan wry, dry, and ever so enjoyable commentary), brings in the sensibilities of the original version, but addresses the subject in a more 2000-friendly way (i.e., ratings, and the immediacy of the decisions), he is shouted down because he didn't do what someone with a pre-conceived notion about what the remake \"should\" be expected.Pardon the expression, but to borrow from good ol' Colonel Potter (and the writers of M*A*S*H), this is a bunch of \"horse feathers.\" The film has an excellent pace, an engaging, lively soundtrack, and fun action. OK, so Chris Klein and Rebecca Romijn aren't Tracy and Hepburn, but this is the first role I've seen Chris Klein in where he has an edge. He actually looks not like the puppy he normally looks, but someone who, when driven to it, can kill. And I credit McTiernan with bringing that out of him.Overall, yes, this is not an Oscar-winning weaper for which Merryl could win an Oscar because she learned another accent, but as far as summer entertainment, I'd say it's superior to most.",

    "review/text": "One has to ask why anyone would want to remake Rollerball in the first place. Aside from the rather interesting James Caan in the starring role, the flat direction by Norman Jewison and the almost laughable story guaranteed this film a place among the greatest cult films ever. Perhaps the makers of this version mistook its cult status for popularity when they imagined that this remake would appeal to today's audience. As if it was an indication of how the film would do, it was pulled from its original release date and \"retooled\" (Hollywood speak for shelved) before new trailers were made and the film was given a high profile launch earlier this year. It was all for naught, it seems, as this film couldn't be any worse. The DVD version is the R rated cut, giving teen audiences the blood and bare breasts that they missed in the PG-13 theatrical version. The slight glimpses of Rebecca Romjin-Stamos' breasts and some slight gore don't make up for what is ultimately a car wreck of a film, that fails to achieve on any level.Chris Klein stars as Jonathan, the new superstar of Asian supersport Rollerball - the sport of near future kings - a combination of motorcross, Jai A'lai, and roller derby. With a clumsy opening credits sequence wherein an enthusiastic american announcer (played by a guy doing a Rowdy Roddy Piper goes to Pittsburgh accent) explains the rules of the game - we are introduced to our first taste of the sport. That the sport is as chaotic and violent as it is - what with motorcyles and people being hit with metal balls, etc. - it makes one wonder why anyone would bat an eyelash at people being killed during the matches. However, Chris Klein and co. become suspicious when they suspect that fatal accidents are being arranged to help boost ratings (incidentally, in this future a giant scoreboard reports the ratings numbers stock ticker style so the game's owner - played with bored detachment by Jean Reno - can immediately see how these \"accidents\" help boost the ratings. And, in another odd bit of out there movie reasoning - the second something dangerous happens in the game, these numbers jump by hundreds of millions of viewers (how such a fickle fan base manages to tune in at a moments notice is puzzling - but I digress).As a fan of McTiernan's other films (Die Hard, Die Hard With a Vengeance, Predator, and even the Thomas Crown Affair) I expected that no matter how bad the story was, the Rollerball scenes would be well executed enough to hold my interest. After all, we never liked Die Hard for Reginald Vel Johnson - did we? Alas, it seems that John McTiernan saw the futility of the project and gave up long before shooting began. The action scenes are flashy and flat - sacrificing a well built scene in favor of the quick flash of less than impressive effects and stunt laden glitz. Its almost as if Mc Tiernan handed over control of the film to a second unit director itching to get his hands on a real film. Of course blame should be shared by cinematographer Steve Mason, whose camerawork shows that he doesn't have the imagination to shoot make believe sport films (add rollerball to the equally treacherous BASEketball of a few years back), his lensing of many scenes feels made up on the fly - and many times it doesn't work. This is espescially true of a long nighttime chase sequence shot through a green tinted lens that gives the scene the look of being filmed through night vision goggles. Equal parts distracting and headache inducing, it is one of the worst cases of a crime against cinema in recent memory.Not that the actors do much to help the film along. Chris Klein, bless his heart, is so out of place in a film where it is required that he exhibit emotion or act like anyone other than Chris Klein. It's as if the rest of the cast and crew went along with making the film so as not to make him feel bad. I felt like a parent at a 3rd grade school play, watching someone else's kid butcher the production. Suffice it to say that when L.L. Cool J is forced to carry the film - the film is in trouble.Rollerball is bad. It will never be revered as a piece of bad cinema to be enjoyed on the level of Showgirls or even Ernest goes to Jail. Rather, it will eventually find its way to the [price] reduction bin at [local store] - and even then its probably not a good purchase.",

Hutton has collected his writing into a book which has Palminteri in threatening mode, since Hutton exposes the underworld low life, which has &quot;consequences&quot;. The title of Hutton's column and book scream irony and the notion of writer as a mythological figure, a modern day Cassandra, is perhaps a little too much of an ego trip for Spiridakis. Things become more surreal when Hollywood calls and options Hutton's book, with the proviso that he includes the latter material he has published on a stripper named Caprice. Caprice is aptly named, a &quot;class act&quot; who strips wearing hideous clown orange glow lipstick and a peroxide wig to the sounds of classical music. (In the real world this kind of stripper would be fired after her first set). Naturally she and Hutton become an item and with Hutton's childhood friend, Joe Pantoliano, relocate to L.A. The L.A. scenes are said to show Hollywood's darker side, though they are most memorable for the star cameos Spiridakis features. Richard Dreyfuss, Tony Goldwyn, Cybill Shepherd, and Jimmy Smits make brief appearances (Smits gets 7 words) which is proof that either Spiridakis' dialogue can cast a wide spell or that he pays well. Palminteri only got one scene as well. Spiridakis presenst all this with a straight face, with the occasional Toni Childs croaker on the soundtrack, intercutting between Caprice painting and Hutton having sex with someone else, split second flashbacks to Caprice's tragic past (which includes a Golden Boy violin), and an amusing opening with the entrance of a long-stemmed flower box thought to be a machine gun at Hutton's book launch. His screenplay features endlessly quotable thearical flourishes though my favourites are a line to Caprice - &quot;It's not easy to love the way you do and still be alive&quot;, and how Hutton is required to produce a screenplay &quot;with teeth&quot;. Hutton performs his duets with Michelle Burke as Caprice in hushed reverential tones, as opposed to the yelling that takes place between him and Pantoliano. Panoliano probably comes off the best, since he tends to rush through his lines. There is an interesting parallel between the two men and the leads in Sweet Smell of Success, with Pantoliano like Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco. Burke however comes off the worst. It doesn't help that she resembles Holly Hunter, but having none of Hunter's ability, and she gets Spiridakis'worst excesses, like a montage of silent screams. Movies about Hollywood are always a little odd, just from the fact that it doubles the illusion, but this is one of the oddest.",

Meanwhile, Hutton's Character finds out that his true life stories got a guy killed by the local mob, and his wife leaves him. Hutton also meets a stripper who captivates him. From there we move to hollywood where Hutton needs to write a script with the edge his columns have, however, the studio wants his later work, including his article about the stripper, but she says he cannot. The tension builds.The movie ends up being made, and that is where you see it make fun of itself and its hollywood dialogue. Very entertaining. But there's also some serious stuff at that point as well--more details of the strippers past and her own personal testimony and wisdon gleened from her experiences.The juxtaposition of music and action in the movie is extremely well done. All together, a very good movie, even if the dialogue makes one want to cringe at times, at least it rights itself by the end.",

The film follows the trials and tribulations of several third year medical students as they compete for limited internships and to do so they have to earn enough honour grades.Vital Signs is an ensemble piece a la St. Elsewhere and, later, E.R. but without the former's quality writing and the latter's adrenaline-fueled pacing. In fact, Vital Signs feels like a feature-length TV show in the way it is paced and structured. The cast is fine if not somewhat bland, with the likes Adrian Pasdar (the nondescript protagonist in Near Dark) and Diane Lane (window dressing in The Cotton Club) who are given very little to work with. Pasdar is appealing enough with his hunky, all-American looks. He plays the kind of brash, young upstart that Tom Cruise was known for (Top Gun, Color of Money, etc.). Lane is as gorgeous-looking as ever and I'm sure many of her fans would certainly like to have her as their doctor...that is until she sends a little boy into cardiac arrest and dies (albeit accidentally). The chemistry between them is pretty good. However, their characters, as written, never transcend their stereotypes or the conventional situations that they find themselves in.Vital Signs is a little too earnest but does have its heart in the right place, it just doesn't do anything to distinguish itself from countless other medical comedy/dramas on the big and small screen.",

    "review/text": "If it were not for the fact that there is a brief nude scene involving Diane Lane, you could well think that \"Vital Signs\" is a filed television pilot. But this 1990 theatrical film, which predates \"ER\" but might remind you more of \"Grey's Anatomy\" since it focuses on a group of third year medical students going through their rotations at a hospital. Dr. David Redding (Jimmy Smits) is the \"dean\" and head of surgery, and the main focus of the drama is the contest between Michael Chatham (Adrian Pasdar), the son of a famous surgeon (William Devane), and Kenny Rose (Jack Gwaltney), who is married to Lauren (Laura San Giacomo), but is too busy competing with Chatham for the big internship prize to give her even ten minutes to catch a quick meal together.Other students in the mix are Gina Wyler (Diane Lane), who finds Chatham to be more sympathetic than Dr. Donald Ballentine (Bradley Whitford), and Bobby Hayes (Tim Ransom) and Suzanne Maloney (Jane Adams), who end up being closer than mere study buddies and are not sure what to do about it. Otherwise the students encounter your standard med school problems: a patient who dies for no apparent reason, fainting at the sight of blood, opening up a patient to find their condition is inoperable, and having a superior fail to listen to you when you know you are right.Director Marisa Silver had worked on \"L.A. Law,\" which might explain why Jimmy Smits signed on to do the film even though he is playing a supporting role to all of the young doctor wannabes. \"Vital Signs\" is okay, but given what we have seen on television since 1990 it just seems so pedestrian in terms of what happens. For those of us who were used to watching Victor Ehrlich train under Dr. Mark Craig on \"St. Elsewhere\" these young doctors have it so easy and it just seems so strange to see a theatrical movie that is so much tamer than network television. Being a cleaner version of \"Gross Anatomy\" is not a strong recommendation and you will find yourself being more impressed by \"ER\" no matter how far it has fallen from its once lofty perch. The acting is competent enough, but \"Vital Signs\" is also hurt by an intrusive musical score that is used to pump some life into scenes. More often than not the effort is counterproductive because you stop and realize what limitations in the film the music is trying to gloss over.",

In those days you could see many classic movies in 'revival' and 'art' theaters, and at one of these we caught the only week ever you could see this film on a big screen.Stanley Beeman's life sucks. He is an anonymous faceless executive in an anonymous faceless job at a generic soul robbing company. His girlfriend leaves him, then comes back just to make him crazy (I was thirteen when I first saw this movie and didn't really understand that this was stark realism until some years later) and, mysteriously somebody comes to tune the piano they don't have.My favorite parts:Art Metrano describing brassieres. (if you don't fall off your chair laughing at this you have no joy )Welles teaching how to handle hecklersSmothers to the thrift store clerk: \"I'm looking for something...seedy\"and too many more to mention.This film lives life at the gut level. Mister De Palma, we LOVE your movies! Please get this one made available on DVD. I would even buy it on a foreign release!",

    "review/text": "Unfortunately, this 52 minute documentary is nothing more than a string of mediocre interviews with clips from Fellini's films that cinephiles have all seen before. Not without charm (provided by Carmen Piccini's obvious enthusiasm for her subject), the doc may possibly serve as a very basic introduction to the Maestro's films but fans will be ill-served. It does not, in any way, capture Fellini's complex, enigmatic personality nor offer fresh, in-depth interviews with the master himself. It does not possess memorable camera work by a genuine documentarian nor an original and incisive script that would lift it out of the hagiographic, lightweight, cut-and-paste cable TV doc format . The short archival interviews with Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese are worthless for what they offer - nothing but platitudes - although Anthony Quinn's tame anecdotes make for pleasant enough viewing - which, ultimately, is what this hokey-pokey documentary is all about: a curiously uninspired and unrevealing stroll through the felliniesque.",

    "review/text": "Anyone looking for an in-depth study of Fellini and his films, for new insights into his life and work, will surely be disappointed by this brief biopic. For the most part, \"The Magic of Fellini\", which has a run time of 55 minutes, consists of interviews with various people who were close to the director in some way or another: personal assistants, assistant directors, set designers, friends as well as the actors who worked with him, Italian film critics and producers. Incidentally, the cover notes that the biopic stars Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen; the notice is misleading since the Woody Allen clip is about a whole half minute long and Scorsese, though eloquent, appears for only slightly longer. There is some archival footage of Fellini himself, speaking about his films, but these clips are relatively brief and some of them will be familiar to anyone who has seen \"Federico Fellini's Autobiography\", originally broadcast on Italian television.Aside from the interviews (of which the ones with Anthony Quinn and Donald Sutherland are the most amusing) there is some footage of Fellini working on set and going through the casting process. The films discussed the most include La Strada, La Dolce Vita and 8 . However, they are covered only very superficially and in a seemingly haphazard manner, not really shedding much light on the importance of these works. The unique partnership between Fellini and Nino Rota is discussed, as well as the partnership between Fellini and Marcello Mastroianni and these pieces are interesting, if brief. What emerges about Fellini from the documentary is that he was an enormously creative man, spontaneous (often his actors would have absolutely no idea about the dialogue or the context of scenes and he would feed them the lines as the shooting went on) and in love with his work.Clips from such Fellini films as 8 , Amarcord, Nights of Cabiria and Roma are interspersed throughout this documentary. As such, \"The Magic of Fellini\" may be a great gift to give to someone who is not familiar with the director's work - it might serve as a nice introduction, a way of piquing the curiosity of someone who has never seen these gems. However, for Fellini fans this documentary will probably be too superficial to be of real interest.",

The covered period starts in October 1944, after operation Marketgarden, and ends on 29 March 1945 with the last V2 launch against Britain. There is some mention of battles around Koeln and the Ruhr industrial region, of the Rhine crossings and of the Remagen bridge, but most of the DVD is about the Ardennes counteroffensive (\"battle of the Bulge\").The Ardennes offensive is described in some detail but the supporting maps are barely readable and do not illustrate well the troop movements. Surprisingly there is an extensive collection of biographies of the major German commanders, including what they did in WWI and what became of them after WWII. No information about Allied commanders.There is no coverage whatsoever of the Eastern Front, even though during that time period the Soviets advanced from the Vistula line (Warsaw) to the Oder-Neisse line (Kustrin, Frankfurt an der Oder) just short of Berlin, after having encircled the fortresses of Koenigsberg, Breslau, Poznan. Therefore, this documentary fails to give an appropriate 360 degrees overview of the vise around Germany in late 44, early 45.",

    "review/text": "Released several months before D.W. Griffith's INTOLERANCE, Thomas H. Ince's large scale production CIVILIZATION was the cry for peace that worked (at least temporarily). It is credited with helping Woodrow Wilson win reelection in 1916 for keeping America out of World War I. This rather heavy handed allegory of a kingdom brought to ruin as a result of war did turn out to be remarkably prophetic.What makes the film so fascinating today are its Dante like depictions of Heaven and Hell with Jesus himself acting as the guide. Producer Ince and directors Raymond B. West and Reginald Barker spared no expense in depicting the horrors of war. The battle scenes are large scale and the brutality is shocking. If the acting is sometimes over the top remember this was meant to be a \"message\" picture. Subtle it isn't. CIVILIZATION is much more than an interesting curio and is definitely worth seeing.My biggest complaint is with the original 1916 piano score by Victor Schertzinger which is reproduced on this video. It seems trite and surprisingly inappropriate for the intensity of the film's story although the orchestral score may have worked better. Schertzinger, a capable musician and director, is best remembered today for making the early ROAD pictures with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. However a newer, darker score like Ennio Morricone's for RICHARD III would have made this film much more effective. It just goes to show how important a musical score can be especially for a silent film. It is interesting to note that CIVILIZATION was a box office success while INTOLERANCE a better film on a similar theme would fail at the box office after the U.S. entered the war. This video is one of five from Kino International's FIRST AMERICAN FEATURES:1912-1918 series.",

Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation.\" By incorporating religious symbolism with social commentary, Ince and director Raymond West crafted a film that struck a responsive chord with the audiences of its day. However, once America became involved in the war, \"Civilization\" was withdrawn from circulation. Despite its historic significance, Ince's pacifist epic languished in obscurity until recent years. Though marred by weak acting and dated melodrama, the picture remains of historic interest for its antiwar sentiments and religious message. \"Civilization\" did not prevent America from going to war, but it did help the country find a spiritual and moral unity during that turbulent period.",

    "review/text": "This is another superb and special film from the First American Features 1912-1918 series (wish there were many more like these!) which makes a bold and daring statement, namely that we're not civilized if we go to war. The emphasis is on the Christian principle to &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; and even Christ himself is active in this unusual film, helping war-greedy humans to realize the tragedy of war and turn to peace instead. It would be a strong anti-war protest even in our day, and one wonders how this 1916 pacifict cry would be received today. But it's still more than just a powerful message for peace and Christianity because we are shown real people that tug at our heart-strings: the old mother whose son is forced to join the army, the children afraid of never seeing their father again, and even a horse trying to rouse its dead rider with its hoof. The spotlight is on one man who has a change of heart during the war when ordered to sink a cruise ship with innocent women and children on board, and due to the sacrifice he then makes, he receives Christ's spirit into his body to preach peace instead. Despite its strong religious impact, the entire film with its excellent scenes and images make it quite compelling viewing even for the non-religious. The picture quality is extremely good, and the intertitles short and to the point, making it overall a most outstanding and special film well worth having.",

With the exception of Timothy Hutton, who is good throughout, the cast lack conviction. Lucia Jimenez in particular is unconvincing in her role as the embattled female lead. But the main reason this movie is less successful than it might have been is the use of Mallorca as the location. Although the movie aspires to darkness the Balearic Islands are totally unable to provide the necessary atmosphere. The settings used are just too beautiful and idyllic. A rainy New York, or even Madrid, would have been better suited to this material. Despite these flaws the direction is assured, the pacing is good, and Monzon maintains tension reasonably well. The Kovak Box is not a bad movie; it's just that it could have been much better.",

    "review/text": "Timothy Hutton plays David Norton, a successful sci-fi writer who is invited to speak at a conference in Majorca. While enjoying the amenities he takes the opportunity to propose to his girlfriend, but their celebratory evening is cut short after Norton finds a DVD on the bed, which is found to contain some disturbing material. While he ponders the strange gift, she receives a mysterious call on her cell phone and decides that she\"Might as well jump. jump !Might as well jump.Go ahead, jump. jump !Go ahead, jump.\" *Simultaneously, Silvia (Lucia Jimenez) awakens after an evening of carousing with a friendly disc jockey, and while she is in the shower she is interrupted by the ringing of her cell phone, the caller ID reading \"Gloomy Sunday\". The next thing she knows, she's thinking\"Might as well jump. jump !Might as well jump.Go ahead, jump. jump !Go ahead, jump.\" *She awakens in hospital, and learns that she has jumped off the balcony in an apparent suicide attempt, foiled by the fortunate placement of a canvas awning, more suited to catching the rays of the sun than falling nudes.At the hospital she sees the grief-stricken David, and realizes that something is terribly wrong on the island. Sure enough, a rash of unexplained suicides erupts, and after she is attacked by a hypodermic wielding man, the two join forces to solve the mystery. The trail leads them to Frank Kovak, a scientist given to creative experimentation, and subsequently to Norton becoming a leading character straight out one of his books.After a slow start, this film picks up nicely, and although Timothy Hutton is an unlikely choice for a leading man in an action film, his co-star Jimenez more than makes up for his shortcomings. David Kelly does not quite master the \"evil villain\" role, but manages to personify an extremely sinister and creepy old coot with an almost visible aura of rottenness hanging in the air around him.The movie draws largely from an urban legend about a depressing Hungarian song re-titled \"Gloomy Sunday\" (sung in the movie by Heather Nova, but also covered by Billie Holiday, Paul Robeson, Mel Torm&eacute;, Sinead O'Connor, Sarah McLachlan and others), said song being more than enough to make you think that you\"Might as well jump. jump !Might as well jump.Go ahead, jump. jump !Go ahead, jump.\" *The premise has been handled better in other movies, but once you get past the first part, you should enjoy this one.Amanda Richards, May 27, 2007*Note: The lyrics in this review are from \"Jump\" by Van Halen. This song is not featured in the movie, and has no link to the movie, but I exercised some artistic license, as the words to \"Gloomy Sunday\" are just too darned depressing.",

    "review/text": "THE KOVAK BOX is a successful little suspense/psychological thriller from the Spanish writers Daniel Monz&oacute;n (who also directs) and Jorge Guerricaechevarr&iacute;a. The story may be a bit far fetched, but then what horror story isn't? The premise for the tale holds up well and is aided by some very fine performances by a mixture of Spanish, English, and American actors. The mood of the film is beautifully set during opening credits by a complex maze in which a white rat sniffs and ambulates from confusing corner to confusing wall - just the manner in which director Monz&oacute;n plans to tell his story.David Norton (Timothy Hutton) is a celebrated science fiction novelist visiting Majorca for a special conference accompanied by his soon to be fianc&eacute;e Jane (Georgia Mackenzie). David has been having premonitions on his flight to the conference and those brooding thoughts continue as he registers for the conference and finds little disturbing clues that culminate in Jane's suicide leap from their hotel balcony. Almost simultaneously an attractive Spanish girl Silvia (Luc&iacute;a Jim&eacute;nez) in the same hotel 'jumps' from her balcony but is saved from death by falling onto an awning. Jane dies in the hospital: Silvia is in the bed next to Jane, witnesses David's grief, and the beginning of a bond is created.David meets a strange old man Frank Kovak (David Kelly) who seeks an autograph of David's first novel 'Gloomy Sunday' and from there the mystery begins. David becomes the unknowing main character in a sci-fi story that mimics ideas from his own first book, a story about the implantation of devices in humans that would enable a central force to assist the victims in their own destructive ends. The plot is tightly woven from this point on and to reveal any portion of it would diminish the chair-gripping finale.Timothy Hutton seems an odd choice for the main character of the film until his combination of cool intellect and understated passion clicks in. The film is graced by the presence of the talented Luc&iacute;a Jim&eacute;nez who seems to have the potential of becoming another Penelope Cruz! The cinematography by Carles Gusi and musical score by Roque Ba&ntilde;os make the setting visually and aurally spectacular. For those who enjoy mind bender thrillers, THE KOVAK BOX will certainly please. Grady Harp, June 07",

    "review/text": "I am not as excited about this movie as other reviewers seem to be. It was worth watching, but contained a serious flaw that detracted from the viewing experience:It suffered from the \"Mission Impossible Syndrome\" in which a character wants to accomplish a reasonably simple goal, but then resorts to wildly implausible, ridiculously complex methods to achieve the goal. In this case, as I interpret the plot, the rich old geezer (well played by David Kelly) wants the famous author (played by Timothy Hutton) to write a story about the geezer's fabulous scientific accomplishments and then kill him, both to make him famous and to spare him from a lingering, painful death due to brain cancer.I guess just hiring an author to write the story and then seeking euthanasia (widely available, especially in Europe) were apparently way too simple for our villain. Instead, he sets up headquarters on the beautiful island of Majorca (coincidentally the writer/director's homeland), arranges for implants to be placed in 100 airline passenger's necks (which would be beyond impossible with today's supertight airline security), then uses the implants to compel the victims to commit ghastly suicides when they hear the song \"Gloomy Sunday\", all in hopes that this will inspire Hutton's character, the author, to write a story about it....making the demented old lunatic the \"star\" of the lurid tale. Never mind that the hugely negative (dare I say Hitleresque) fame resulting from a crime of this magnitude would certainly not be desireable, and definitely not worth the incredible expense and effort needed to pull it off. Indeed, he could have probably just skipped the implants and induced quite a few suicides simply by playing the song....it's a real \"downer\".Common sense would dictate that if he were rich enough to finance this preposterous scheme, then he probably could have hired a Pulitzer-prize-winning author to immortalize his achievements and then fly to Sweden for a catered orgy/assisted-suicide bash with live entertainment by Destiny's Child. Instead, he resorts to this wildly implausible plan. But let's face it, if a writer/director is absolutely determined to make a movie on his home island of Majorca, why would he let an implausible story line interfere with his plans?On the plus sides, the scenery is magnificent and the female lead, Lucia Jimenez is a pleasure to watch....sort of a \"poor man's\" Paz Vega. Production values are first rate and the acting is good overall.Speaking of which, be sure to watch Timothy Hutton in the \"special features\" at the end of the DVD. He is apparently a very honest man, for despite his actor's training and experience, he has great difficulty expressing any real enthusiasm for the plot or his character. He knows the absurdity of the story line, and to his credit, he lets it show. Pay heed to Tim's lack of enthusiasm and watch this overdone potboiler with your common sense firmly on \"pause\".",

    "review/text": "Set in and filmed near Florida's Everglades, this motion picture, made essentially for children, stars Clint Howard, younger brother of Ron, as seven-year-old Mark Wedlow who, along with his father Tom (Dennis Weaver, a wildlife officer, and mother Ellen (Vera Miles) becomes involved in a series of emergency-based adventures concerning Ben, a young black bear. Mark's first contact with Ben takes place when the latter is a cub, as the boy watches from hiding as three poachers, played by veteran tough guy Ralph Meeker, ex-Bowery Boy Huntz Hall, and Clint's real-life father Rance, hunt down Ben's dam with Meeker's character killing her with a rifle shot, then capturing her offspring for future use as a source of lucrative bear meat. Based on the novel Gentle Ben by Walt Morey, this work inspired a spin-off popular late 1960's television series of the same name, also starring young Clint and Weaver, and features a series of incidents which showcases the remarkably uninhibited fondness which Mark displays toward one of the largest imaginable pets, seven feet and 750 pounds. Portrayed by an exceedingly well-trained animal, Bruno, big Ben is shipped to a zoo after an unfortunate occurrence, but escapes into the Everglades, and subsequent events, replete with family oriented scenes focussing upon a needed rapport between the youngster and animals, most non-ursine, presents cliches a-plenty but gives an opportunity to enjoy another solid performance from the fetching Miles.",

    "review/text": "David Bowie didn't have as many videos in this visual companion to his Ryko double disk The Singles Collection 1969-1993, brimming with songs. However, nine of them predated MTV as much as nine years. Bowie made performance clips of &quot;Space Oddity,&quot; &quot;John I'm Only Dancing,&quot; &quot;Life On Mars,&quot; and &quot;Jean Genie.&quot; Here are the highlights.The first few videos are mainly performance clips without any trickery or conceptual story. Of those, &quot;Jean Genie&quot; could fit in MTV, as it combines a studio performance by the Spiders and a live performance, even a blonde who first appears on cue when he mentions Monroe. But in &quot;Life On Mars,&quot; Bowie's paled makeup, blue makeup around eyes, and blue suit is an interesting study in colour contrast.The three videos promoting the singles from Lodger (1979) was a preview to MTV, all shot on video camera as opposed to film. &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot; is amusing and camp as Bowie sings and dances around the mike, while three women (Bowie in drag) sing the chorus and the &quot;boys&quot; refrain. And what could be more kitschy then two of the women sashaying on a fashion show platform, removing the wig, and smearing their lipstick in outrageous fashion? Only the Garbo lookalike Bowie, cane in hand, maintains a sense of decorum and dignity.&quot;Look Back In Anger&quot; combines the story of the angel of death coming to take someone away and the Portrait of Dorian Gray, as the right side of Bowie's face becomes painted like the painting of the angel. And &quot;DJ&quot; is silly nonsense of Bowie in a pink suit playing a DJ tossing records over his shoulder and wrecking the playing booth.Then the next triptych of videos, from Let's Dance, which did much to promote him and album sales in the era of MTV. Bowie's usual performances is intercut with some Australian aborigines, particularly a young couple, in the title track. The most controversial one is &quot;China Girl,&quot; which culminates in Bowie and his Chinese girlfriend emulating Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in From Here To Eternity, only without clothes and with pronounced ecstasy. &quot;Modern Love&quot; taken from the Serious Moonlight Tour demonstrates Bowie's comeback, and he still dresses well, the beige suit complementing his bright yellow hair.The videos for Tonight are visually entertaining. &quot;Blue Jean&quot; has Bowie in two roles, rock star Screaming Lord Byron in beige makeup and dressed in Indian style blue turban and baggy shirt, while he also plays a nerd trying to impress a bored and unimpressed girl that he knows Byron. &quot;Loving The Alien&quot; uses the motif from the album cover of a blue-painted Bowie against stained glass, praying fervently through clenched teeth, while a chador-clad Arab woman appears throughout.Three videos are taken from movies Bowie appeared in and incorporate movie footage/motifs. &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; has him chasing the mysterious Zebra Woman while scenes from the movies are shown. My favourite as that's what I first saw regularly. The others are &quot;Underground&quot; and &quot;As The World Falls Down&quot; from Labryinth, the latter featuring quick speed drawn animation like a-ha's &quot;Take On Me&quot; but white on black. And what to make of the lonely love-stricken young girl printing off pictures of Bowie on her personal copier in &quot;Falls Down&quot;, intercut with movie scenes and performance footage?The videos from Never Let Me Down are a mixed bag, with &quot;Day-In Day-Out&quot; being a grim story of a single mother who's led a rough life, her lover stealing from stores, and she getting into quite a rough adventure when she goes streetwalking. &quot;Time Will Crawl&quot; has Bowie being manhandled and thrown like a ragdoll by a set of dancers while Peter Frampton plays guitar. He was probably glad to watch them do their nonsense from the refuge of nearby scaffolding. Marathon dancing from the 30's is the inspiration for the title track, which despite the disclaimer &quot;never before released&quot;, I saw a couple times on MTV back then.The screen is split into a center square and many tiny squares all around in &quot;Fame 90&quot; has Bowie cavorting with some blonde in the center while clips from his old videos and other footage is shown in the tiny squares, bringing this collection full circle.",

Phil is stellar on the drums throughout, but he takes his solo appearance on Take Me Home, the first track on the DVD, and hams it up so much he ruins it. Jimmy and Arrow, while not exactly outclassed, just don't seem to have the stage presence of the legends that follow. So I usually start with Carl Perkins (track 3), and then cut to Mark Knopfler (track 5?), then the rest of the show.That said, there are not less than 3 or 4 literally goose-bump inducing moments when the performances and/or the combined stature and command of these legends just takes over and you have a kind of magic. One is the effortless showmanship of Carl Perkins, wearing blue suede shoes to sing his timeless classic (rather see him do it than Elvis, honestly). The crowd reaction when Knopfler introduces Clapton to play along on Money for Nothing. Then Elton John completely filling the hall with just the piano and his powerful solo vocals on Live Like Horses (an appreciative member of the orchestra sitting behind Elton is seen shaking his head in awe and admiration).And of course, as others have said, McCartney singing Hey Jude when Elton comes in on the second verse. Chilling. The sing-along with everyone is spectacular. I even thought Ray Cooper was a hoot. I've never seen a guy get so much joyous mileage (or style) out of a tambourine and a pair of sunglasses.",

    "review/text": "This is a Must Have DVD for any Rock &amp; Roll fan. The list of performers alone should peak your interest. Imagine Mark Knopfler, Sting, Eric Clapton &amp; Phil Collins doing the best rendition of 'Money for Nothing&quot; you have ever heard, then add Ray Cooper's animated percussion, a choir and and an orchestra - WOW! The individual performances are very good, but when the performers team up - it is phenomenal! Other notable selections include Eric, Mark, Phil, Ray and Jools Holland in 'Same Old Blues'; when Paul McCartney, Elton John and everyone else team to do 'Golden Slumbers', 'Hey Jude' and 'Kansas City' it is magical. The video quality and sound are both excellent. Thank goodness this is a DVD, I have experienced this so many times other media wouldn't have any quality left.",

    "review/text": "As usual, in no two performances is Mark's work ever the same. Compare the same song on different albums and you will see this. What further distinguishes him from pretty much every other performer is his use of fillers in his music. He doesn't use them. Every note has a purpose, and never does he sing the same way or play the same way. He is truly creativity at its best. His performance of Brothers in Arms was breathtaking, his voice even deeper than usual. Backed by an orchestra full with composer and a good percussionist for a mystical effect unmatched on all previous albums, live or studio. You have not heard this song until you hear this version.Money for Nothing was good, with Clapton playing some lead, Phil Collins on drums, and Sting on backing vocals. However, in my opinion it was a bit too crowded for the sound technician, and he could not do it justice. It was still great though.The icing on the cake would have to have been Layla, track 15, which was Clapton on acoustic rhythm guitar with Mark playing lead. The communication between the two was incredible, as the song gracefully swayed between one and the other as Clapton extended his rhythm sections for Mark to play lead. Likewise, Mark toned down his riffs to make way for Clapton's vocals and finalee. It is noteworthy that both solos on the track were played by Mark, and both were his own interpretations.If you like the version of Layla on Clapton Unplugged, prepare yourself to fall in love.On the above only the dvd is worth having. The other guys were good, but I'm here for the MK fans. Incidentally, I saw him on the Philadelphia tour in the Albert Hall this June. He was good then, but he was waaaaaay better here.",

    "review/text": "This is what the British singer Elton John told the public that overcrowded the famous Royal Albert Hall, in London, before he sang and played Live like Horses, a song he composed to be played along with the Luciano Pavarotti. Unfortunately Luciano could not come up so Elton John did both his part and Luciano's! The outcome you will see when you buy this DVD but I may tip in advance that the audience in the back, composed of musicians from the Royal Orchestra, was totally overwhelmed by the solo performance of the pop singer Elton John. The venue of the show is an attraction in itself, being one of the most sacred temples both to classical music and to recent pop history if we remember the former Beatle John Lennon asking the noble audience to shake their jewels.This superb September 1997 show was done to raise funds to help the people from Montserrat to rebuild their lives after a volcano eruption almost completely devastated the tiny Caribbean island it in the same year. The performers were mainly British and one after the other they convey to the audience and to home spectators the sheer intensity of their devotion to music. Sting, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Mark Knopfler, Elton John and the former Beatle Paul McCartney, just to name a few of the pop stars present at the performance, with a little help from the British Royal Orchestra, play some of their most famous songs and, in the end, band themselves together in a final jam session not to be equaled in sheer intensity by anything done before in pop story. Just figure out what is to have in a single session the likes of Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Elton John, M.Knopfler, etc..., and to top it all, with background orchestra and vocals conducted by sir George Martin, the man who made arrangements to almost all Beatles songs!!It is a must buy to anyone who enjoys music played by the best performers from the 60's trough the 90's; this DVD will bring you a lot of the pleasure you may be looking for. Enjoy it!!",

    "review/text": "I just finished watching this for the first time, and was completely blown away.I could tell you that seeing Carl Perkins rip through his rockabilly standard \"Blue Suede Shoes\" is worth the price of this entire DVD, but (with the exception of Jimmy Buffet) it just gets better and better from there.Mark Knopfler's breathtaking rendition of \"Brothers in Arms\" is immediately topped by his performance of \"Money for Nothing\" where he's accompanied by Sting AND Eric Clapton.Sting offers a couple of Police tracks which he's slowed down to that modern contemporary housewife Jazz he's now renown for.Elton then steps up, and with only a piano and his voice offers three more deeply moving classics to the list of ever improving numbers...thankfully none of which are any version of \"Candle in the Wind\".How much would you pay for this incredible list of performances!?! BUT WAIT!!! There's more....Enter, yet again, the man himself. \"God\", as some have called him, I prefer the term \"Slowhand\"... ERIC CLAPTON sits center stage, with trusty Martin 6 string in hand, and gives one solo number before being joined again by Mark Knopfler. The two perform the best version of acoustic \"Layla\" I've ever heard....and after that, Clapton gets real good...And just as you think it can't get any better..out comes Sir Paul McCartney...and with 40 years of material to draw from, pulls out the trump card and gives three Beatles numbers which evolve into all star jams featuring all of the afore mentioned artists.With this amazing spectacle you also get Phill Collins, Montserrat native; Arrow, George Martin, an entire symphony orchestra, an enormous chior and ivory tickler extrordinare; Jools Holland,.... who even shows up Elton John's piano playing during the monumental \"Kansas City\".While watching this film I didn't know whether to laugh out loud or cry like a baby...so I just sat dumbfounded...If I had anything negative to say about this masterpiece, it would be only that Jimmy Buffet should have been selling paradisian cheeseburgers in the lobby, because on that stage he was out classed, out ranked, out played, and outshined...I'm not even sure what his useless carcass was doing up there in the frst place. If there was an option to add half a star..I would have given this film 4 and a half instead of five only because of him.... But I'm willing to look beyond that one dark speck and give it 5 for all of the brilliance involved.If you dig music, you'll dig this DVD.",

It deals with several musicians including Elton John, Sting, Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler who each do from two to four songs and the others accompany them during the performance. My favorite bits were Mark Knopflers Brothers in Arms and Money for Nothing with Phil Collins on Drums, Eric Clapton and Knopfler on Guitar and Sting doing backup vocals.All in all a worthwhile DvD. I enjoyed it immensely.",

Sure enough, Doby sounds awful, but when I selected 5.1 the sound was perfect. After that I enjoyed a really great concert with some excellent cuts from Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler-Dire Straits, Sting, Paul McCartney and many others. Brothers in Arms, Money for Nothing, Layla, Hey Jude and a great rendition of Kansas City with everyone joining in. If you think you might like this DVD you will, so buy it, just be sure you use 5.1 or DTS!",

    "review/text": "Wow, this was a shock to see rock mega-stars like Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney and Mark Knopfler side-by-side-by side on stage for a couple of numbers. Add in Phil Collins on drums, Ray Cooper on percussion, Elton John and Jools Holland on keyboards and more good backup musicians, plus an orchestra and big choir and it all made for a memorable night, I'm sure, for those at Royal Albert Hall in London in 1997.The benefit concert in September of '97 for the residents of Montsserat, a Caribbean island which had been devastated by a volcano the year before. Many of the aforementioned artists had recorded some of their famous songs on that island at the Air Studios at Montsserat.In addition to the above, there was Sting, Jimmy Buffet, Arrow & His Band and Carl Perkins. It's always a thrill to see and hear rockabilly legend Perkins doing \"Blue Suede Shoes,\" which he also was wearing! Sadly, Carl died a little over two years after this concert.My personal likes of this concert included Buffet's catchy number \"Volcano,\" with new lyrics covering what happened at Montserrat; Phil Collins' entertaining \"Take Me Home;\" John doing his first hit, \"Your Song;\" a wonderful low-key collaboration between Clapton and Knopfler on \"Layla;\" Clapton's guitar solos and some good keyboard work by Holland on \"Same Old Blues;\" and the rousing finish of \"Kansas City,\" led by McCartney, who seemed to be the featured performer in this galaxy of rock stars.With almost two hours of music, anyone can find enough material here to give them an entertaining night of music and when all of these guys get together for the final couple of songs.....well, that has to be seen to be believed. This is a real collector's item for music lovers.",

And most of the performances are excellent, particularly Knopfler, Elton, Clapton and McCartney.I'd buy it again, if only for the McCartney/Elton exchange on &quot;Hey Jude.&quot; I've watched this concert many times, and it still sends chills everytime Elton's voice appears in the second verse of this song.As for the complaints about the &quot;tambourine bloke&quot; -- that's Ray Cooper, the legendary (with good reason) percussionist who has backed most of these performers in studio sessions, and who is a mainstay of almost every all star concert. If you want a video concert that will absolutely knock you over, try to find &quot;An Evening with Elton John and Ray Cooper&quot; -- it used to appear occasionally on the Disney Channel (oh, well, so did Annie Lennox's Central Park concert), and if I ever found it on a commercially released video, I'd pay almost anything for it. Listen to Cooper's incredible performance on this concert (or better yet, see one of the live Elton John/Ray Cooper, sans band, shows) and you'll never again complain about Cooper being a &quot;distraction.&quot; Ray rocks!",

I immediately logged in to check this and other reviewer websites and found that many complained about audio quality, but there were a FEW who DID NOT. After closer inspection, I found that there were two versions of this DVD-- one with Dolby 5.1 only (released 02/02/99) and one with Dolby and DTS (released 10/26/00). Well, I searched around until I found the DTS copy and low and behold-- audio is MUCH better on DTS format-- like night and day for me and my sound system is definitely NO great shakes.... I highly recommend this DVD, even though ths sound still won't quite rate a 5 star, but the performances and collection of musicians definitely come close. BUT buy the DTS version!!!!!!",

Elton John's solo set was great, and so was the sound. Clapton's set also was FIVE stars, both performers received well deserved standing ovations. Yes, Phil Collin's song and on Sting's two the sound was uneven, but not enough to ruin their performances! Paul's voice, yes like Elton and Clapton, has matured, but was very good. I thought his voice was actually strong, nowhere did I hear him struggle. AND! to see Phil Collins on drums, Eric Clapton on guitar, and then Paul sing a verse of HEY JUDE, then Elton John sing a verse, and then Sting. AND all of them NaNaNANA. WOW WOW WOW. I think some of the reviewers must be perfectionists who reviewed this earlier. IT WAS FANTASTIC. I sat down today for my first go to just listen a tiny bit, and couldn't drag myself away! I played the entire concert. It is that good. Maybe the recording is not top notch, but the performances ARE. Yes, the tamborine bloke was a distraction, but only on a handful of songs, I'll grant that. But the sound is 4 stars. I gave this 5 to offset the perfectionists! It is at least 4.5 stars, overall.

He had a lot of fun out there. I was a little disappointed in Clapton's playing but there were just so many great performances. Knopfler's Brothers in Arms (with those amazing kettle drums...sounded like the blitz over our heads!)left the audience literally weeping. Money for Nothing was fabulous. Sting was in great form. If that wasn't enough, Elton John (who had just finished the Diana tribute only weeks before)doing &quot;Your Song&quot;. I'd never seen him live before and I now understand why he is such an incredible performer. Just him and a piano. If that still wasn't enough.. Paul McCartney playing Albert Hall (34 years to the day) that he was last there. When he came out solo and strummed the first few chords of &quot;Yesterday&quot;, there wasn't a dry eye in the place.

The only drawback to me (but not enough to drop this rating to a four) is the flow of the music early on....Phil Collins does an excellent job on the opening track with Take Me Home, but then we shift to Hot Hot Hot, Blue Suede Shoes and Jimmy Buffet. Just seemed kinda screwy.However, this is the turning point of the show with no weak performances the rest of the way. The highlights being Brothers in Arms, Sting, Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me, Layla and a great medley from McCartney to wrap things up.The DTS recording is solid, but not at the level of Clapton's 'One more Car, One more Rider' or the Eagles 'HFO' but not many are.

    "review/text": "This concert was held to benefit the island of Montserrat after it was largely destroyed by a volcanic eruption. The show is good overall, and the sets by Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton are sublime. All performances are backed by such luminaries and Phil Collins and Phil Palmer and a full orchestra, which has never done better work than they do here on \"Brothers in Arms.\"The best performance of the show comes from Dire Straits founder Mark Knopfler. Dire Straits recorded the album \"Brothers in Arms\" in Montserrat, and here he performs the title track more perfectly than the on the original recording. He finishes his set with the help of Sting and good friend Eric Clapton with \"Money For Nothing.\" Clapton returns the favor by having Mark sit in on \"Layla\" in what may be the definitive version of the song. These two master guitarists alone justify the purchase of this DVD.I didn't really care for the Elton John or Paul McCartney sets. I don't know why the orchestra sat unused on \"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\", but it was not for the better. Likewise, McCartney is a great performer, but I have seen way too many singalong versions of \"Hey Jude\" at this point. McCartney's version of \"Kansas City\" though is one of the highlights of the show.Everyone onstage does a competent job, but the performances of Knopfler and Clapton really do steal the show.",

One minute it was clear and loud, the next it was soft and garbled.- Since this was filmed in London it was awfully Anglo-centric. I understand that, but why only one song from Jimmy Buffett? If anyone can capture the spirit of the Islands, it is Buffett.- Who is the idiot playing the tambourine? We sure could have used less footage of him.Overall this is a good DVD, especially if you are a fan of McCartney, Clapton, Collins and Sting. If you are a Jimmy Buffett fan looking to add to your collection beware: the price may not be worth the admission,",

Eric Clapton and Elton John also bring the house down with staggeringly good performances, and later on its just a full on jam with some of the world's premier musical artists. What a night of music!Word of advice: ONLY BUY the DTS version of the DVD...it makes a MASSIVE difference in the quality of sound - you won't regret it.Enjoy.",

Janet changes outfits so many times, you'd think she pass out from exhaustion, but she keeps on pushing out all those wonderful high/low notes till the end. The sound track is also great, there may be audience roars, but JJ can be heard VERY easily over them; actually, the crowd's yelling is sort of a bonus in that the viewer can see &amp; hear what the audience is feeling about those same pieces (they're always applauding for more). The DVD is well assembled with a great track listing, sound recording, and the video is excellent as well; if you have or haven't seen Janet in concert, it won't matter, because this is a great DVD for the novice and experienced.",

THE VELVET ROPE is Janet's most personal offering, with songs about acceptance, personal pain, etc. The tour is a must see. Janet takes on various personas through different costume changes, that symbolize her songs. Not only does she sing songs from THE VELVET ROPE, but she digs back, all the way to CONTROL and RHYTHM NATION 1814 with songs the fans have always loved. As tiring as the tour is, this party doesn't stop, as she entertains through and through during this concert. There is a charisma with Janet on stage, between her and the fans, her and the dancers, anyone she wants to make contact with. This is a show for the fans, and a show that doesn't disapoint. Highlight performances include the Control Medley, the Escapade Medley, If, Rhythm Nation, What About, and more. Give this one a whirl if you want to be entertained!",

And Janet sings her heart out - all your favorites, from &quot;If&quot; to a medley of &quot;Control&quot; hits, to a razor-edged rendition of &quot;Black Cat&quot;. The emotional song, however, is &quot;What About&quot;, with dancers in the background enacting various scenes of violence between men and women, with men being the aggressors. A powerful song, &quot;What About&quot; only speaks more eloquently with its visuals. This DVD is never leaving my collection!

A lot of the control and rhythm nation songs were made into medleys though some of the ones with intense choreography like If, Rhythm Nation and so forth were performed wonderfully. Janet also created great new chorography for what about, you and i get lonely which could have also been singles. I wish Everytime was sang on this show though that ballad is just so beautiful.

    "review/text": "In 1998, I got the rare opportunity to see Janet Jackson in concert held in Minneapolis, during \"The Velvet Rope\" tour. The show was amazing. All of the physical features and her performances were breathtaking. Though nothing beats the live experience, this DVD wonderfully commemorates the tour.Months before, she released an album of the same name that was unusually different than her previous. She was always known for her positive songs. However, the album entirely explored her painful turbulations, including abuse, loss, depression, and others. These songs are based on thoughts she endured during her two-year depression, 1995-1997. Many listeners were shocked. Some of these songs gave this tour a new outlook. Despite revisiting many classic songs, audiences can feel her new style.The elaborate stage direction gives the concert a more enjoyable experience. The three different backgrounds and the three different costumes add to the spectacular pleasure: inside the velvet rope theme, the circus-like theme, and the hip-hop theme. All blend perfectly with the dance moves and the songs. However, her vocal expressions remain present the whole performance while never being overlooked. Her facial expressions prove that she truly feels the songs. Through the sexuality, political motivation, the pain, and the anger, she maintains her full musical quality. All songs offer a new prospective through her life. She keeps audiences excited, always having fun.\"The Velvet Rope Tour\" proves how truly great Janet Jackson is an entertainer. This DVD edition is great for all fans as this will surely please audiences for a long time. The tremendous quality proves that she'll continue entertaining for many more years. Go Janet!",

Every time I watch this concert, I'm blown away by how much energy Janet and her whole crew put into the show. All the singers, dancers, musicians, and the audience was so hyped! Plus, the fact that her band got to strut their stuff from time to time, made my day. I also run sound (PA) for bands so I know how incredibly hard it is to mix for a live event. I thought the mix could've been a little better. At times, you can barely understand Janet or her background singers. Some songs are a little clearer than others. However, I can't wait for this concert to come out on VHS, Laserdisc, or DVD. Being the music enthusiast I am, I'lll probably buy all three formats. The overall show was (is) really awesome.

She and her dancers really rock and the concert is incredible. There is never a boring moment. This tape is exciting to watch, especially if you loved the concert and are a big fan of Janet's work. I really recommend it. Janet Jackson is an admirable performer, whether or not you are a fan of her Velvet Rope work (which I happen to love). She works very hard and appreciates her audiences.

I recommend you to buy it, but if you are really looking for the more live (Janet wasn't signing live, Madonna did), energetic, sexier version of this tour, then I'd rather you get the Girlie Show tour by the real queen of pop, Madonna (it was the best moments of my life to be there watching it live in front of me).",

They have always laughed at the mention of Janet Jackson as a peer to the Rolling Stones of the world. To each his own, I guess. Who needs them. Janet never needed to go begging for validation.If you do not have a stereo VCR plugged into a room sound system by now, you can't get the real pleasure of this or any concert video. It's the only way to appreciate the depth of the sound. And finally, what man doesn't envy the guy that was chosen to be the on-stage object of Janet and the girls! I cannot sing &quot;My, My, My&quot; as good as Johnny Gill, but this is as close as any man could hope to get to Ms Jackson. There would have been no hope for me even if I was there at the concert.

I have viewed this video each time it has aired on HBO and I must say - I have been totally mezmarized {so have my children}; her stage presence is totally awesome, she gives her all and then some - her background singers and her dancers are equally incredible - the performance they all gave was heart-pounding. I have been a Janet fan since the real early days &quot;come give your love to me&quot; and even earlier than that {she and I are the same age}; - no matter what you think of her or her performance you have to give the girl her props - let's face it out of all the children her parents had she's the only girl that is doing something with the gift GOD gave her, not downing her sisters but I've heard them both sing and well - I'm gonna leave that alone, anyway my personal opinion is that Ms. Jackson is the BOMB, and even though I'm a woman I would have loved to be where that guy was sitting when she gave that lap dance to &quot;Rope Burn&quot; of course that is my favorite part of the concert.

    "review/text": "Being an avid Janet Jackson supporter I must say that her live jaunt \"The Velvet Rope live\" was one of her best tours ever.. For those who think she is trying to be like Madonna, they should do some homework. THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TOUR THAT JANET JACKSON TIED UP A MAN LIVE ON STAGE... This was also not the first tour that had many of the Broadway and theatrical elements that, Madonna has in many ways made famous. Madonna is not the end all of live performing and just because she may have done something first does not mean she did it best.Now this is not to say that Janet's live show is 100 percent \"never been done\" but nothing in her show is exactly like Madonna ever did, and anything close to what Madonna did, is totally mixed in with Janet Jackson's genius and taken to another level, as only Janet Jackson can take it.The show begins with a storybook opening and with one big BOOM, JANET JACKSON IS UPON US. The pop diva slowly comes to the stage to perform the title track \"THE VELVET ROPE\" and then BURSTS into the high charged \"if\". other stunning moments through the 2 hour jaunt included a beautiful medley of her slower hits \"let's wait a while\" and \"again\" and a cute \"wonderland\" medley of her hits..Another issue that many find a problem is lip-synching. Although Janet does not sing songs like \"if\" or \"r.nation\". over half of her live concert is just that, live... from the slow songs of \"let's wait a while, and again\" to trob, and the entire wonderland medley, Janet sings live song after live song. the song \"black cat\" is live as well, and the final set, of \"go deep, together again, got till it's gone and that's the way love goes\" are all live... she gives a 2 hour, non stop, high charted performance with elements ranging from Broadway to break dancing.This Madonna/ Janet thing is really childish. They are both pop divas and although many times it may seem as if one is gleaming ideas from another. Janet Jackson's entire career and especially this career defining VELVET ROPE CONCERT, is 100 percent Janet...",

She then hushed him, move a lil here and there, and THEN kisses him in the end!!! I don't think I would have the courage to do it with some random guy, but Janet takes risks. I really like the Special performance. Seeing all her childhood photos on the screen. I wish I was there to experience that. Seeing how big the crowd was back then, it makes me wonder where are those people now? Those were the days when Janet was the HOT thing. I really miss that. She's such an underrated, forgotten artist that doesn't get the credit she deserves. They need to release janet. and the Rhythm Nation tours. Those were great tours as well. Ohh..and on the side, she also proves her haters wrong that she can SING live! That is all...good day!",

I wasn't exactly a huge Janet fan at the time since I was too young to really get into her, but I was immediately captivated by the colorful sets, Janet and her dancers' tight moves, and the smooth flow of the show. Janet starts from the beginning by inviting us inside her velvet rope (great concept) and revealing her sensual side with classics like If and That's the Way Love Goes, her vulnerable side with Again, Every Time, and Special, her playfulness on Go Deep and Escapade, and shares her views on societal issues on Rhythm Nation and the aggressive anti-domestic violence of What About. The I Get Lonely performance as well as Rope Burn's striptease are highlights. You go through so many emotions by the end, but feel happy and carefree by the time Together Again closes the show. All the classics are performed as well as some of the best songs on The Velvet Rope. It's a theraputic rollercoaster that's entertaining from start to finish.",

I can clearly see her influence in other artists such as Destiny's Child and Britney Spears. Janet might not be a great vocalist, in fact thats her weakness but her performances make up for what she lacks. Her dancing and her ability to rarely rely on a backing track makes her a great performer.I was probably no more than 10 or 11 when this concert was shown and it was good then and great now.Janet's energy and determination can be seen and felt throughout the show. She seems more focused than ever and it shows. Aside from that, her band and dancers were on point with every key and step. All of her top hits at the time are performed; \"IF\", \"Control\", \"Miss You Much\" and \"I get lonely\", they are all here.If you want to see a great LIVE concert with great sets, vocals, dances, costumes and props then pick this one up.

    "review/text": "This dvd is amazing! Janet is off the hook! However, I must say that I ADORE THE HAWAII dvd just released recently, and would recommend that one over this one...Janet looks so fab in the Janet in Hawaii dvd, and I love \"All for You\" and all the songs on that same cd that the Velvet Rope tour doesn't provide. Also, All for you has so many hit songs, not just her most recent cd to promote. I am only to be trusted if you have my same taste in \"Janet\" experiences! :) I know \"The Velvet Rope\" is one of her most (if not the most) critically acclaimed work of her career, but for me, it is too dark. I like some of the songs like \"Go Deep\" but for me, sexy Janet aka Janet. and \"All for You\" are the cds for me.Let me preface what I said by saying that ANYTHING Janet is worth owning, and I did give this 5 stars which says that anything beyond this DVD(for me) is just out of this world!!!Janet is a true performer, and she knows how to work it, and after seeing Miss Janet live, her dvd's come close to reliving the magic!Standout performances on this disc are \"What About?\" the haunting domestic abuse song, as well as \"If\" the classic song, as well as medleys of her best songs. If you get a chance, why not pick up Janet in Hawaii and add this on to your \"Velvet Rope Tour\" purchase! :)",

The dancing is out of this world and Janet looks like the true diva-performer extraordinaire that she is. I recorded this show on VCR and the audio on this DVD could stand to be a little bit better. Also, they cut one small scene out, it's where Janet brings a guy up on stage and the first guy doesnt suit her taste, for whatever reason, then she has him taken off the stage and recruits another. On the DVD you never see the first guy who is brought onto the stage. If you like Janet you'll want to add this to your collection and if your not a Janet fan you will be after seeing this show!",

Michael keeps in contact with the audience from the beginning of his concerts to the end. When will you people see that Janet just copies her brother's dance. The show was great, but her concerts really are not as exciting as Michael's are. If you people have seen the HIStory tour it will blow you away. What I mean is that he had some killer special effects, and the lighting is tight! So my message is this, give credit where credit is due.",

Of course we all know that Madonna fans were gonna diss Janet but there just jealous that Janet is better than Madonna. In front of more than 22,000 fans and live on t.v. for the first time ever Janet seemed unfased. She didn't mess up once. Maybe Mariah, Whitney, and Celine's voices are stronger but Janet can sing so sweet just like she held that long note in &quot;Again&quot;...but in performance no other female entertainer can dare come close to Janet. And in my opinion she is a better performer than Michael. Michael does the same robotic moves but Janet can hit you with a different style everytime like &quot;I Get Lonely&quot;, &quot;Rhythem Nation&quot;, &quot;If&quot; and &quot;That's The Way Love Goes&quot;. Over 15million people say Janet's HBO concert in America and it was the number one network for that night. Her tour has grossed over $33million in the U.S.(including the sold out show in Hawaii in which over 40,000 people showed up for and that was the highest attendance for a concert there ever and generated over $2million dollars).It also made over $150 million worldwide.

    "review/text": "ok, first off, i am a janet fan (not hardcore, but casual)but this concert is such a rip off of Madonna's Girlie Show! The circus, clowns, strippers, masquerade masks, velvet curtains, top hats, women in suits and ties, dark lighting, it was all done in 1993 by Madonna. I do give Janet credit for choosing many of her hits to be in this show. HOWEVER, her songs do not have the same energy when they are performed live as the studio recordings do. For example, her performance of If is so lackluster musically, and it shouldn't have been. That song has so much energy in it, but here it kind of falls flat. Her performace of LEt's WAit Awhile and Again though, was fantastic. very beautiful. the only thing that bothered me was at the end of that perforamce when she took about 10 minutes before she sang the final line of the song. I was like &quot;finish the damn song already!&quot;. I was really looking forward to the Throb segment but was really disappointed. I know the song has very few vocal lines to begin with, but Janet barely even tried to sing THOSE! seems llike she was just there while music played. ALSO, WHY DID THE DANCERS HAVE MORE COSTUME CHANGES THAN JANET??? Hellooo. Janet wore the same outfit for the first 40 minutes of the concert while the dancers had at least 4 costume changes. JAnet finally changes clothes for the Escapade medly, but then CHANGES BACK INTO THE COSTUME SHE WAS WEARING FOR THE FIRST SEGMENT! That white collar shirt and black slacks...I've never seen an artist do this before.Some of the songs are awkwardly placed. Special after Rhythm NAtion is weird...why is she wearing her militant gear for a soft song like Special while pictures of her childhood flash on a screen. it also made me mad when she didn't sing ANY of the choruses for That's The Way Love Goes but instead had the audience sing it. helllo, janet, helllooo! Also, Any Time Any Place is just an instrumental not the whole song, that pissed me off too. The HIGHLIGHT of the show was Rope Burn when she brings that guy onto the stage, that was funny! He was so excited. Poor guy, he probably almost had a heart attack when Janet kissed him.Anyway, this concert is enjoyable to some extent, i did fast forward thru some parts like Alright, I've never really liked that song. Together Again was pretty weak as well, although i do like the song. Worth viewing once, but pretty forgettable.",

She could have put some more color into the show...and gosh take off those black slacks. The dancer with the short bleached blonde hair was annoying to no extent but the other dancers were cool. The only problem with this concert, is that the transition from one song to the other is really awkward. She should have really thought out the order of each song much better than what she actually did. She should have opened with a hit song too, and done much more with Got 'til It's Gone.

After throwing a party (in the first episode) Janet and Chrissy find a man sleeping in their bathtub. . .eventually, they become roommates.A lot of storylines on the show revolved around misconceptions, and misunderstandings. The on-going joke that the landlord thinks that Jack is gay. In the first three seasons, the landlords are an older couple named The Ropers. And their on-going joke about him not wanting to sleep with her. Kind of like Al Bundy, on Married...with Children.Guaranteed many laughs. Rest in peace John Ritter.",

They were so wonderful together.. I remember the show as a kid and, now I am gonna do some catching up by purchasing all the seasons on dvd. \"Three's Company\" is one of a kind!

    "review/text": "I know there are people who don't like Three's Company and think it's too silly but I think they just didn't give it a chance. My older sister who is nine years older than me doesn't like it and thinks it's too silly but she is very picky anyway and is more into drama shows. I love this show which in my opinion is a classic! Joyce Dewitt and Suzanne Somers were very good as Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow and so were Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as landlords Stanley and Helen Roper but my favorite of all was John Ritter as Jack Tripper, he was so cute and funny and he will be greatly missed! Jack's friend Larry played by Richard Kline only appears in one episode in the first season but thankfully becomes a regular for the rest of the seasons. The DVD only has 6 episodes because the first season was a mid season replacement. All of the 6 episode are very funny, I don't have one favorite but I like them all the same. The price of the DVD is very reasonable and proceeds are being donated to UCP (United Cerebral Palsy) in memory of John who's brother has CP. A very worthy cause! I very highly recommend this DVD and I'm looking forward to getting the second season and all the rest of the seasons. John Ritter will be missed but never forgotten! BTW: I hope that they will put John Ritter's last TV show 8 Simple Rules on DVD!",

Though, some of the innuendo went clear over my head, I just knew it was hilarious. John Ritter (as Jack Tripper) was introduced to us, on this program, as a fantastic physical comedien. This man looked like he was made of rubber! The way he ran around with boundless energy and made wonderful use of the broad and bawdy humor to his advantage. What's more, his supporting cast was absolutely terrific here. This co-stars Joyce Dewitt and Suzanne Sommers.I won't go into detail about plot here, but I will say that the stories are centered around the lives of three roommates--two women and a man. In order to get the \"okay\" from their landlords, on account of their slightly \"unconventional\" living arrangments, Jack Tripper (Ritter) passes himself off as gay [which he is anything but!]. Chaos strikes many times, but not without plenty of laughs along the way. Enjoy!",

    "review/text": "Many things, both pro and con, have been written about Ms Joan Crawford,and some of it true. Who WAS she ? Many of the actors of Joan's era came from difficult backgrounds.The Depression hit America very hard and stars like Gable,Turner,Rooney,Shearer,Davis,Alice Faye,Gardner,Allyson,Garland,were nearly all from one parent families armed with a sense of desperation and ambition to be rid of poverty at any cost.It is no accident that Gable's first two wives were both women much older than he,the first of whom taught him to act,and the second helped him find work and got him to Hollywood. It is no accident that Crawford's first two husbands were Douglas Fairbanks Jnr a member of Hollywood royalty, and Franchot Tone, an actor from a wealthy family who became a leading Broadway actor.Joan,embarrassed by her lack of education, watched and learned from these two men and worked tirelessly at her craft with their help and support.Tone was keen to co-star with Crawford on the stage, but she was too terrified,too insecure to face a live audience.He grew tired of having to reassure Crawford over and over how beautiful,well groomed and perfect she was before they could go out to premiere or party. At first glance,it would appear that the Tyranical Joan was being the obsessive person daughter Christina had spoken of in her damning book. However, it was far more likely that Joan was secretly in great fear of letting herself down as she mixed with famous,wealthy,people from the film industry. She needn't have worried,as many of the men she had to impress,and indeed came to work for,had come from humble circumstances themselves.Each MGM star had their own carefully constructed persona for audiences to relate to. Joan's was as a working girl, an office worker,a factory hand. Millions of women all over the world loved her,she became a huge star.She starred in eight pictures with Clark Gable,they got along well together,had a long term affair,and he appears to have been the love of Crawford's life.This documentary does not dig for dirt,it instead studies the career of Joan Crawford and her need to keep working - well past what was then her use by date.Whilst married to Tone,they frequently went to the theatre together. Joan saw several plays that she felt would make good movies,solid vehicles for her.She told Irving Thalberg about them, he listened,bought the film rights and handed the leads to his wife Norma Shearer!The great tragedy in the lives of these Hollywood Stars (Marlene,Garbo,Turner,Shearer to name a few) was the trauma of growing old. When your looks are paramount to your work,your identity,it must become a terrible ordeal to see oneself aging,then wrinkled and old.All of these women became recluses in old age, Crawford refused all dinner invitations, gave away her devoted dog,and remained in doors.She was drinking heavily and must have been very lonely. She died of a heart attack.I recommend Joan Crawford - Always the Star, a tribute to a woman who after growing up in poverty,became the biggest woman box office star in Hollywood.",

    "review/text": "To my knowledge there are only two biographies of Joan Crawford available on DVD:- this item, produced in the 1990s by Janson Media/Wombat Productions and- \"Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star,\" produced in 2002 by Turner Classic Movies and included as a bonus feature onMildred Pierce (Keepcase).This DVD is shorter than the TCM program, but both are very good overviews of Crawford's life and career. Which one you prefer will likely depend on which of Joan's children you believe is telling the truth about her alleged abusive behavior (I know, it is terrible how any discussion of Crawford will invariably lead to this subject but since the two programs differ significantly in their presentation of it, it bears mentioning). This program does not interview Christina Crawford (author ofMommie Dearest) but instead interviews one of Joan's other daughters who says she never witnessed such behavior and doubts that it ever existed. The TCM program, however, features Christina as a main interviewee and in it she mentions several incidents of abuse.Watch both and decide for yourself. That point aside, this is worth adding to your classic Hollywood DVD library.",

I needed to watch a good movie, and not the commercial junk with overated computer graphics. Then I saw this one. They only had one copy of this movie in the store, so I thought that this would have to be a low-budget movie. &quot;Why the heck not&quot; I said to myself, and picked it up.I've never regreted that choice in all my life.What struck me, was an action movie with a poetic heart. In all the excellent shooting, there is an &quot;in between the lines&quot; essence of the beauty of life, portrayed differently in the many characters in the movie. Good acting by some, great acting by most. Ice-T does a good job playing the &quot;bad guy&quot;, and I'm tempted to say that this is one of Christopher Lamberts finest pieces of work.The ending of the movie, will probably disappoint some, but look between the lines here too, and also here you'll find that everything about this movie wreaks of excellence. You'll actually probably also come to the conclusion that the movie couldn't have ended better. This one is a true classic, and I am surprised it didn't get more storm than it got on its release. Well, let me just uproar a storm, and tell you to watch this movie. Action, humour, drama, heck it's got it all, and then some. Highly recommended warm hearted action movie!",

    "review/text": "I have not read James Marcus' book, \"Amazonia,\" but in a recent NPR interview, he insisted that during his Amazon tenure he was never pressured to write positive reviews of things he found crappy. However, Amazon's editorial review above makes me doubt such a claim. If the guy had said this movie is so bad that it's good, I could accept that. But to suggest that \"Mean Guns\" has redeeming qualities that anyone involved with it actually intended it to have? You've got to be kidding.Also, do not believe the overall user rating for this movie or the low ratio of helpful to unhelpful votes that my review will inevitably get (assuming anyone ever actually reads it). Most people who have rated it are probably Christopher Lambert fans, so they obviously have no taste. For anyone who realizes Lambert has less acting talent than a dead dog, let me inform you that \"Mean Guns\" is actually terrible. I will admit that I found it to be enjoyably bad -- the incompetence of everyone involved gave me a few pretty good laughs. But enjoyably bad is still bad. I will say this -- at least it was not nearly as horrible as the previous Pyun-Lambert project, \"Adrenalin: Fear the Rush\" -- a movie as boring as it was atrocious. But that ain't saying much.The absurd premise of this movie is that a bunch of members of Ice-T's crime syndicate have betrayed him. So he rounds them all up into a prison (a prison that will be put into use housing actual inmates the following day, mind you) and distributes all sorts of weapons among them: bats, guns, knives, you name it. The members of the syndicate are supposed to kill each other off and the last three members alive will split $10 million.A friend of mine once jokingly suggested that the plot to this movie was devised after Pyun found out that many of his actors could not stay on long enough to finish the movie (hence the pointless killing of all the characters as the movie progresses). Frankly, if my friend's suggestion turned out to be true, it would not surprise me in the least, because this movie makes no sense at all. Why nobody kills Ice-T, I don't know. Why Christopher Lambert leaves a kid in his parked car outside the prison while all this goes on, I don't know (or just can't remember). Why there are vampires in this movie, I don't know.All I do know is that it is bad.",

Ice-T is in top form, playing the all time bad guy. This movie is very cool, not necessarilly plotless or pointless. Just shows alot of the things mercenaries do, and what they will do for it. This movie has alot of humor, often sexy, even a bit dramatic especially towards the end. And is of course filled with nonstop action, and one of the best. Very enjoyable anybody who likes awesome action movies then check this one out, its killer.

I'd love to see this one re-made with John woo directing. Bloodless violence aside (which takes the edge off the movie) the only thing that lets the DVD down is that the congenital cretins at Tri-Mark have seen fit in their infinite wisdom to present it as a Full Frame picture rather than the 2.35:1 aspect ratio it should have been. The picture quality of the disc suffers abominably when zoomed to full frame, and the action becomes confusing, the cropping at the sides being blatantly obvuious. Come on TriMark, let's have a Widescreen re-release of this one. One of Pyun's better efforts, on a par with Nemesis.",

    "review/text": "I tell ya, nothing goes with fragging someone like mambo music. It used to be banjos, but that turned out to be a flash in the pan, and no one ever did capitalize on DELIVERANCE. MEAN GUNS rolled around in 1997 in all its made-for-cable glory (or, at least, that's where I first saw it), and it rapidly lured you in with its soup of hot mambo and nasty dark humor and sparse plotting and its onslaught of screeching bullets and homicidal attitude. Mmmm, fun.Ice-T breaks it down: In one way or another, they've all betrayed a powerful crime syndicate. The syndicate's representative is Vincent Moon (Ice-T) and he means to mete out a balanced measure of punishment, reward and entertainment. The site is this vacated penitentiary, in which a host of killers and reprobates (and maybe an innocent or two) is set loose and scrambling for the tossed-out cache of firearms and the heaps of ammo and the baseball bats for the anti-NRA contingent. Moon's offer: Everyone kills everyone. The last surviving three split ten million dollars. The deadline is in six hours. Off you go.Plot, schmlot. This isn't Jane Austen's MEAN GUNS. It's Ice-T's MEAN GUNS, and that means lots of hip hop swagger and teeth made of platinum and what passes nowadays for cool gangsta shizzy. Christopher Lambert, with his raspy, French-tinged accent and the street creds garnered from HIGHLANDER still somewhat intact, he saunters in playing a demented killer who gets himself invited into the \"tournament\" because he thought it would be fun. Accompanying him to the bloodbath is a little girl, because I guess you gotta do what you gotta do when you can't scarce up a babysitter or when you're barking mad. Lou, Lambert's character, tends to chew Valium, Prozac, and Ritalin. So \"barking mad\" it is. Demonstrating a streak of common sense, the film doesn't even try to portray Lou as the good guy. In fact, a good guy is nary in sight.The tongue-in-cheek vibe and the mambo soundtrack (and the occasional Spaghetti Western guitar riffs) perform a sleight-of-hand trick, enlivening things, lending an off-kilter note, distracting us from the fact that this B-movie could just as easily be this repetitive and morose shoot-'em-up. And, of course, we already realize that it's all senseless. It could've been interesting, being privy to these little immorality plays and seeing how the group dynamics would form and then the inevitable back-stabbings and falling out. But, really, there's not much of an attempt at characterization and you end up not giving much of a whiff for anyone onscreen. Even the cute little girl wants blood. 'Kill that creep, will you, Marcus?\" she suggests. We're left with cardboard cutout characters, all but one of which are supremely callous and amoral.If there's one prohibitive person that you pull for, I suppose it's Marcus, that wintry gent who looks like Lyle Lovett nursing a grudge. But his recounting of a fable about cannibalistic bears doesn't count as character development. And you certainly don't root for Ice-T. You know that sucker's gonna get his sooner or later. He can't sit in his control room the entire movie, watching the bloody spectacle on his all-seeing surveillance camera, hovering over his pewter chess pieces like the master manipulator that he is.The DVD includes the trailer and a bio and filmography for both Lambert and Ice-T. Seedy stuff indeed. These two cats aren't what you'd call top-shelf actors, and MEAN GUNS, looked at one way, can be easily dismissed as a meagerly budgeted claptrap of action cliches. I happen to think that the judicious application of mambo salvages the movie, that the bent characters, hollow and trite, do work because of the dynamics involved, and the violence is so cheerfully over-the-top that I ended up overlooking the cheesier, lamer elements. Because interspersed here and there are some pretty nifty action-packed moments. Ultimately I have to quote Lou, that unhinged pistolero who must've called out to the perverse in me: \"Sorry, I couldn't help it... heh heh... just too much fun.\"",

    "review/text": "Every so often a movie comes along that changes the way we view humanity, the universe, and God. Every so often a movie takes us to great heights of joy, only to lose it, and then get it back over and over again as heros redeem themselves as villains are vanquished. Mean Guns is such a movie, indeed, perhaps the greatest movie of the 20th century, and maybe of all time! Mean Guns is destined to be mentioned first in the same breath as 'Gone With the Wind', 'Citizen Kane', 'Little Shop of Horrors', and 'Dude Where's My Car'.The complex plot concerns a shadowy criminal organization knows as the 'Syndicate' just finished constructing of all things, a prison! To this prison are summoned the Syndicate's assasins, who, unbeknownst to the assisins, were caught by the Syndicate stealing or betraying this underworld conglomerate. So the ringmaster of this get-together takes the assasins' weapons at the door and then gathers them in a main room, the prison is locked, and tells them that they were 'caught stealing' and, now they were to fight each other down to the last three alive, which would then split 10 million dollars between them. This festive occassion would be watched by the Syndicate on a closed circuit television screen.Now to start this contest, the ringleader tosses several vats of guns, bats and ammo in on top of the assembled assasins. I think you can figure out where the movie goes from there. Indeed, as the fighters spead out all over the vacant prison, alliances are developed, complex philisophical issues are raised like the prevelance of pervisity present on MTV, or the overuse of profanity in the movies, appropriate pharmaceuticals for todays assasin to take, in a nutshell, a veritable graduate course on applied ethics taught through the dialogue in this film.Indeed as Hoss, Crowe, Barbie, Moon, Marcus, Dee, Rickie, Kam, Lou, Oslow, Bad Hair Guy, Screamer, Joey, Big Bob, Staircase Guy, and Blackie ruminate on life, the universe and everything, it boggles the mind that Mean Guns was not nominated for 12 academy awards.There is so much one can learn from this film! Like the childhood story of the 'Three Cannabalistic Bears that go out looking for food one day', 'Why you shouldn't swear when you dont have to', 'What could be better than Pay TV', and why 250 people trying to kill each other 'ain't the junior league, or the girl scouts or Melrose Place'.All this as the movie is set to the Mambo music of Perex Prado? What more could a movie goer ask for. And as Lou says of Prado, 'He makes you wanna dance', indeed I felt like dancing as this movie made my soul soar when I contemplated the heights to which mankind may reach when properly motivated by shotguns, baseball bats, and 10 million dollars.All in all, this film has a fascintaing premise, the film is truly an escape and well done. I wish director Pyun was able to put more money into the development of this film. Also I hope there is a directors cut somewhere. Mean Guns is an amazingly good movie despite how preposterous the plot may sound. More and more people love this movie as we trade and pass around the DVD. Mean Guns gets more and more fans every month! No one knew this movie in 1997, but now there are at least 6 websites devoted to Mean Guns.Get this movie, its worth it!",

I am not saying this is an oscar type movie, but if you like gun fights or action, it is worth a look.The action is almost beginning to end, with only spots to delve into the personal side of the characters. But even as small as they do, I still felt as if I got to know them.The music is not the standard with a latin flavor. Now I am not a fan of this type of music, but it fit great into the pace and action of the movie.Overall, it was a movie about killers killing each other, and there was a ton of gun fights &lt;and other close range weapons&gt;, but off hand I dont remeber a gorry or over graphic scene. The worst scenes left the graphic to the imagination, and just used sound and camera angles to show 'just enough'And a small note to any Christopher Lambert fans... He is awesome in this movie. If you like him, worth seeing just for his role.",

A bunch of criminals have been put inside a brand-new prison shortly before it is due to open by a criminal organization called \"the Syndicate.\" Only three will be allowed out alive. The action starts when the Syndicate boss adds guns, weapons, and ammo by pouring them on top of the condemned. After that, the movie is vignette after vignette of criminals taking each other out. If you pay close attention, it ends up there is actually a more complicated plot, stemming from unfinished business between the three meanest killers in the place.There is a homage to Christopher Lambert's \"Highlander\" roles involving a baseball bat and some dude's head. The setting is simultaneously vivid and stark, very interesting throughout. Some attractive ladies, oddball criminals, an innocent man (well, he came voluntarily anyways), an old West style shootout, gold teeth, and great comic timing.This isn't thought-provoking or deep but it moves quickly and has a good mix of action, blood, and wry humor. It's a perfect movie for those times when you don't want to think too hard.",

Armed with not only guns but baseball bats, the movie is one long let's see how many people we can kill in ninety minutes. The murders are offensively brutal and with a plot that limps along, one has to wonder why this movie was even made. How can we root for anyone when they are all heartless, cold-blooded killers? Christopher Lambert, the stone faced hero of B movies, even brings along his little daughter to wait in the car while the murders go on. The movie tries to embrace some kind of code of honor among murderers, but is there honor among these low lifes? One female actress, who plays Barbie, is so obnoxious I couldn't wait for her to meet her demise, and it takes a long time to happen, too. With an ending that is so forced and implausible, MEAN GUNS is one mean film, and that doesn't mean you should watch it if you know what I Mean.",

The dialogue is very well written, the characterization is perfect, and the mambo soundtrack fits the carnage perfectly. And the ending will blow you away (pun intended). Some of the actors are a little stiff, but the leads Christopher Lambert, Ice-T, and especially the guy who plays Marcus, all perform very well.This movie is definitely worth checking out.

The three left standing get to walk away with some big money in their pockets.Like most Pyun films, Mean Guns doesn't stand up to intense logical scrutiny, but that's not the point. The movie ends up being oddly contemplative, as the script draws out a handful of troubled characters thrust into a grotesque situation. While the emphasis is clearly on the action -- and there's plenty of it, well-shot as usual -- there are surprising moments of quiet where the audience is allowed to get close to these \"bad guys\" and come to at least part of an understanding of what their lives are like, what they think and feel. Lambert and Halsey are particularly good here, as a killer who's come unhinged because of a familial tragedy and another who's lost all hope of ever walking away clean, respectively. Good stuff, marred only by a very poor full-screen presentation.",

Imagine a modern day version of &quot;It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; with individuals and teams chasing after a cash prize of millions; only this time it's hidden inside a prison complex instead of underneath a pair of palm trees and the losers end up pushing up daisies. When the chase begins you'll find yourself picking favorites and rooting for them to win. The movie also borrows tastefully from &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; and &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, with it's many showdowns and shootouts. The main characters are surprisingly well written and acted out (especially Marcus and Lou)in such a way so that you get a very good look into the personalities of each one without seeing a great deal of personal history on screen. And, of course, if you do watch it and wind up agreeing with none of this, the least you'll have to admit is that the musical score rocks! The mambo music playing over the prison PA system was a wonderfully original touch. Check this movie out. The violence may not make it everyone's cup of tea (I personally loved it, fast paced and gritty yet not bloody), but it has more than enough pluses to make up for it.",

The characters are certainly entertaining, and have more then one dimension to them. My favorite was Christoper Lambert, who insisted to Moon (the organizer) he be allowed entrance. Marcus was good and that actor had the best performance. The only bad thing about this was it's length: it was to short. That might sound weird, but it seemed like some explanations had to be cut short for length purpouses or budget constraints and I was confused at some points due to it. I'd like to see this remade big budget with Chow Yun-Fat, as Lou, and John Woo directing. Maybe Samuel Jackson as Moon.. And perhaps Sam Orbach (though he'd need to lose weight) as Marcus.

And if that was your complaint then you better not own a copy of Hostel or any other Torture film.Second, there isnt suppose to be an action hero in the film. If you want a meaning to the movie it is simple. Crime does not pay. In a world of crime and lawlessness eventually even your fellow criminals turn on you.Why does Lou have his daughter at the prison? Did you watch the film. Lou is either a complete Nut Job or vengeance seeker. From the red flashbacks he either killed a child, kidnapped his own daughter and murdered her mother/father. Or he his doing what he says he is doing, trying to make good for him and his daughter.Vampires? Vampires? you mean the guy with the fangs at the gate? Or the demon winged guy Lou sees on the building? The first guy is a bodyguard of Moon's who for some reason has custom made teeth in the shape of fangs. So what. He isnt a vampire, never even crossed my mind that way. He just fits in as a poser gang style thug. Very cyberpunkish. The \"demonic image\" on the roof is a hallauciantion of Lou's, similar to the boy in the hallway.The movis is simply 90 minutes of action, set with decent music and fun editing. The characters are largely stereotypes, but no more then Spider-Man, Captain Jack Sparrow or Shreck.

Then, the criminals are thrown guns and baseball bats to dispatch each other.....plot heavy, eh? What makes this movie work well are the wonderful action sequences, a great performance from Christopher Lambert as Lou, a psychotic killing machine with the best lines in the flick, and the actors who played Marcus and D both did well in their roles. Also, the movie's &quot;soundtrack&quot; is quite good....you'll see why if you watch the flick. The only weaknesses of this flick are really the annoying innocent lady, who, while she adds the human element of the flick, is very annoying throughout the movie. Also, the well-endowed femme fatale of the flick, nick-named Barbie, is somewhat annoying at points in the movie.

    "review/text": "You really must hand it to Christopher Lambert. After showing great promise in the action film &quot;Highlander&quot; back in the 1980s, his career rapidly took a nosedive. Lambert could have been the next big action star if he had played his cards right, but instead he followed up his initial success with the lengthy and oftentimes plodding &quot;The Sicilian.&quot; Actors who make this type of mistake rarely call it quits; they merely head into the realm of B movies where all things are possible if one is willing to throw such antiquated notions like dignity and art to the wind. The 1997 film &quot;Mean Guns&quot; shows Christopher Lambert at the heights of his nadir. To be honest, Christopher shouldn't carry all of the blame for this lifeless excursion on Mount Boredom: Albert Pyun, a noted hack responsible for numerous dead on arrival film projects, directed this plodder. The fusion of an aging and desperate Lambert with Pyun's questionable abilities virtually insured that this movie would disappoint. What is so sad about the whole thing is that the idea behind &quot;Mean Guns&quot; is an intriguing one that, with a little bit of imagination and a bigger budget, could have been one of the best B movie action films made in the last ten years.A powerful, and as sometimes hinted at, supernatural crime syndicate decides it is time to take out the trash that has been bleeding the operation over the years. This organization sends out invitations to the top killers who have worked for them in the past, inviting them to a meeting set to take place in a recently constructed prison. None of these thugs know exactly what is in store for them, but they all know that when the boss calls it pays to listen. As the criminals file into the penitentiary, they soon learn what's going on: each of these men and women must use whatever skills they possess to kill all of the others. To add a little spice to the contest, the syndicate stashed ten million dollars in cash somewhere in the prison as a reward to the last three people left standing. Heading up this operation is a platinum toothed Ice-T, a goon of especially unsavory reputation whose role is that of master of ceremonies. T rigged the prison with cameras and cellular phones so he can watch and hear the unfolding carnage as the murderers go at each other with gusto. The syndicate even supplies loads of guns and metal baseball bats at the start of the game to help things move along. Is this whole thing a trick or is the syndicate actually willing to shell out millions to figure out who is the best of the best?Regrettably, &quot;Mean Guns&quot; fails on so many levels that it is difficult to outline all of the problems. I recognize that many people really enjoy this film as it is, but it could have been so much better. First, a movie that promises not stop action should have some nice, bloody shootouts. Forget about it. &quot;Mean Guns&quot; is as bloodless as an episode of &quot;The A Team.&quot; People are beaten, shot, and stabbed with nary a popping squib to show for it. I had to go back and check the rating on this film after watching it because I simply couldn't believe that a 'R' rated film would be this prudish with the sauce. People taking a shotgun blast at close range do have a tendency to bleed, but not here. Sam Peckinpah could have worked wonders with this idea, but in the hands of the stingy Albert Pyun, it simply falls flat. Moreover, the director fails to properly design or photograph the massive gun battles that occur with great regularity throughout the film. Again, using Peckinpah's slow motion mayhem technique would have remedied many of these flaws. I don't know if film fans today just aren't used to seeing bloody action films intelligently captured on celluloid, but this movie had great potential to paint the prison red and it failed completely. What a shame.The characters suffer due to a tedious, hackneyed script. You simply don't care what happens to most of these characters at any point during the film. Sometimes, films can make criminals interesting if the writer and director take a psychological approach to their subject. Look at &quot;The Godfather&quot; or &quot;Casino&quot; as examples. In &quot;Mean Guns,&quot; most of the characters are simply cardboard cutouts serving as mere cannon fodder. An attempt to make Lambert's character, a bleach blond killer who cackles and clucks his way through the movie, suffer from some sort of flashback about the death of a child fails because it really isn't all that interesting either in its execution or in its explanation during the film's final showdown. Don't watch this movie thinking you will see smart characters expertly developed, although Pyun regulars will note the presence of leggy Tina Cote, an actress who appeared in &quot;Omega Doom&quot; and a few other Pyun films. Her head catching on fire provides the only sustainable laughs in this film, and only because it is so incredibly cheesy.What do you get with the &quot;Mean Guns&quot; DVD? Not much, really. Some trailers and cast bios for Lambert and Ice-T is about it. The transfer looks acceptable at least, and if you like mambo music you're in luck as the whole soundtrack to the picture consists of nothing but mambo tunes. Bloodless gunfire and mambo; that is about the only thing I will remember about this movie. If you want to see a good Christopher Lambert film, watch &quot;Highlander&quot; again, for only die hard fans of the man with the French accent will appreciate this clunker.",

He is responsible for &quot;Omega Doom&quot; and &quot;Crazy Six&quot;, two movies that in spite of having quite different plots, possess in common the peculiar and curious way with which the director accomplishes his works. &quot;Mean Guns&quot; follows the Pyun's formula: many shootings and closes in slow motion,different and weird camera moviments, strange characters and a poor script. In this film, Lambert is a murderer who,along with other criminals, is trapped inside a prison and he needs to survive before his chances drain. Pyun substitutes idea and good-sense for excellent action scenes, that remind plenty of John Woo and Sam Peckinpah's best efforts. Unhappily, that is not enough to maintain the interest for this bad film.",

    "review/text": "Mad Max is a very imaginative, wild, and satisfying film. It's sequel The Road Warrior is a bit more thrilling, but Mad Max delivers the goods. The film is set in the post apocolyptic Australia, where savage biker gangs and outlaw drivers rule the roads. The film begins with policeman Max Rockantsky(Mel Gibson) who engages in a thrilling highway chase between him and a crazy driver called Nightrider. When Nightrider is killed in a firey crash, his psychopathic friend, Toecutter, is enraged, and wants revenge in blood, Rockantsky blood. Toecutter and his vicious biker gang are known for terrorizing towns, tying people to speeding motorcycles, and much worse (as seen in the film). For a while in the film, they stalk Max, his wife Jessie, and his infant son in very weird, creepy scenes. Then when Toecutter and the gang run Jessie and her baby down on their motorbikes, Max is beyond enraged, thus becoming the title character, Mad Max. The end of the film is a sensationalized thrillfest as Max dawns his leather road outfit, two guns, and hunts down the gang in his new Police Interceptor, running some down, shooting one, and I won't mention what happens to Toecutter. Mad Max is very bizarre, very brutal, and very very entertaining. The stunts are quite impressive, the villains are very well cast (particularly Toecutter and Johnny)and Mel Gibson is the ultimate Mad Max. The only snag: the film goes at a snail's pace. Otherwise, go rent this movie, make some popcorn, and get ready to hit the road.",

I have never had the oppertunity to see the U.S version but would love to own it one day...The exellent chase scenes and crashes are now part of Aussie film history. The scene of Max getting his leg blown open by the gang shows why he has a leg brace in the sequel.

    "review/text": "For 1978/79, Miller's debut feature is tightly directed and highly engaging thanks almost to the constraints that had to be imposed because of the films amateuresque style. Gibson breaks out of his screen starting gate like a racehorse, the villain gang is well (and humourously) put together and the plot is as souped-up and humming with power as practically all the vehicles shown therein (remember that post-apocalyptic sci-fi thrillers only became well and truly cliched after the third installment of this series). Still, the real stars of the show in this picture are the cars themselves. Those Interceptors painted yellow and marked 'Pursuit' are the best thing to happen to a Datsun since the invention of the 454hp engine and scoop. Miller directs the road sequences with zest and conviction - so much so that the frenzy of the death highway comes out to stab the viewer in the eyeballs at times. There are a few funny bits with deaths etc. Most are well executed [except for the Edwin Nealesque (he's the guy who gets smushed under the wheels of that truck at the end of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre') demise of the ludicrously camp biker leader, 'The Toecutter'] but watch out for the sequence where Max runs the bikers off the bridge right after his wife and kid get splattered. Look for the guy in the red helmet and brown jacket (I think he's also wearing a white aviation scarf) who falls on the road (most of the bikers being catapulted over the railings). Found him? Okay, good. Now wait until you see the front wheel of the bike to the left of him smash him in the head and jerk his neck forward. That actor must have died! No way could anyone have lived through that without serious hospitalisation. Hmmm.... was George Miller trying to get too opportunistic with that? Anyway - it's a damned fine film given its unripe origins so go see it whether you're familiar with the trilogy or not. Scholastic work for sure.",

Despite that, his metamorphosis comes to fruition in &quot;Thunderdome,&quot; in which Max regains his humanity to the fullest degree.Side made several in Australia before this one, and the one to see is &quot;Tim,&quot; in which Mel gives an incredible performance that's about as opposite of an apocalyptic anti-hero as anyone could get.

    "review/text": "Mel Gibson has a history of playing borderline psychotic, revenge-driven loners from contemporary actioner Martin Riggs (\"Lethal Weapon\") to widescreen epic hero William Wallace (\"Braveheart\") to hard-boiled noir tough guy Porter (\"Payback\") to historical fiction family-man-pushed-too-far Benjamin Martin (\"The Patriot\") to the classic Shakespearean originator of the mold Prince Hamlet (\"Hamlet\"). You could almost say it's his niche.And in all fairness, he started young. Mel Gibson was an impossible 21 years old when he starred in this 1979 throwback to 1960's biker thrillers produced by the then-unknown team of George Miller and Byron Kennedy. A huge hit in Australia, it was limited to small theatres, drive-ins, and arthouse runs in the United States...where, despite a dubbed dialogue track that would make most kung fu movies seem Academy Award-worthy, it picked up a loyal cult following and enabled a small group of would-be hipsters to be able to say \"Mel Gibson? Oscars? P'shaw...he'll always be 'Max Rockitansky' to me.\"The movie is not exactly original...it's a redux of the American western with elements of the aforementioned biker flicks, but it is VERY original in its use of some very innovative cinematography (cameras mounted at fender-level on fast-moving cars...I'm not certain it had ever been done before) and some of the more unbelievable stunts ever filmed, the like of which would not be seen again until the sequel's release in 1982 (\"Mad Max 2\" or \"The Road Warrior\", depending on your location). The action is more personal because it is REAL.Mel Gibson's performance might not seem on par with his better roles since, but the role he was playing was that of someone much older than himself at the time...and it can't be denied that even at 21 he had a command of the camera he has never relinquished; you can't take your eyes off him. Of his earlier roles Gibson is rather self-conscious of his performance in \"Mad Max\"; he refers to himself as \"Mr. Porkchop\" in this movie, somehow under the impression that he must have been overweight at the time...but fans of his will want to see this movie to see how he looked before his days as a household name and to chart his development as an actor.Fans of action movies will want to see how movies of this nature looked in the \"old skool\" days before high-budget special effects when the level of action in your movie was dictated by how far your stuntment were willing to push the envelope of sanity. In Australia during the making of this movie and \"The Road Warrior\", it fast became evident that no such envelope even existed. The result is a piece of hand-made brilliance of guerilla filmmaking that would inspire latter day innovators such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez into accomplishing so much with so little.And of course the fact that this DVD is equipped with the Australian dialogue track is a selling point unto itself (it also shows exactly why a dub track was used for US distribution; it's not that we can't understand the accent, mates...we just have no idea what the slang means). That and the commentary track by the production team make well-received treats for those of us who are old enough to have loved this film since its original release. A retrospective on Mel Gibson's career and its beginnings is also a nice addition. I can only hope that \"The Road Warrior\" gets a similar treatment (and soon).In short you have a great movie with a a great DVD extras package at a VERY reasonable price...I don't know what more a movie buff could ask. This is definitely a \"must-own\" for your collection.",

    "review/text": "Who wouldn't watch a movie that had Mel Gibson wearing obscenely tight leather trousers, and looking scarily young?Before The Passion was brought to the attention of film buffs, and the press, there was Lethal Weapon. And before that, Mel Gibson made his name in the Mad Max movies.There's nothing on the DVD I got for my birthday, not even a trailer. And I hate watching DVDs with no trailers. I'm fussy me. So I wasn't sure what to expect, or what the film was exactly about. All I knew was that my mum couldn't wait to watch it, and was drooling (along with me) when Mel Gibson appeared shirtless.Before the amount of money that was spent in the car chase along a freeway in Matrix Reloaded, there was this. A simple, but still effective car chase, which introduces you very briefly to Max. I don't see the point in spending loads of money, when all you need is a bunch of cars that can be trashed, and a camera.Then you get to see that Max has a pretty young wife and a young child. You can almost see how the rest of the movie pans out after that. It's pretty obvious, he's not mad until something really traumatic happens. I was expecting the whole growling, throwing stuff, but instead, he seemed relatively calm - except for the sweat on his face.It's NOT obvious that this movie could get another two sequels out of it. Maybe one sequel, but two? And the latter featuring Tina Turner of all people. And there's rumoured to be a fourth, along with a fourth Die Hard, and god knows what else. Something tells me Mel Gibson won't fit into those trousers!If you think this is going to be a movie based on revenge, you're wrong. The revenge part doesn't start until about half an hour before the end.It will be interesting to see the sequels. To be honest, this film did nothing for me - unless you count the tight trousers! Very easy on the eyes, if you know what I mean.",

Unfortunatly I purchased the DVD version which was released in 1998. It doesn't have any special features at all. You are also stuck with the American voices dubbed over the Austrailian actor's. This can be quite funny in itself but I wish I had the option to see both the original Aussie tape and the Americanized version on one disk.",

    "review/text": "This DVD is like watching a brand new version of the film with crisp imagery in letterbox format. For those who haven't seen this movie, it's the original story of Max and how he eventually becomes the \"Road Warrior\" as portrayed in the sequel. The film was done on a lower budget than its successor, but contains great action with some terrific stunts. The main attraction of the movie is his work as a pursuit officer on the highways where outlaws are running havoc over an understrength police force. Max and his peers are almost as rough as the outlaws, creating a gray area between justice and crime. The story centers around Max's aggressive pursuit of an escapee named the Knightrider, resulting in the outlaw's death in a violent car crash. The Knightrider's motorcycle gang then come looking for Max in retaliation, and Max's family suffer the consequences. Max then transitions from police officer to vigilante, going after the bike gang on his own terms.The movie is high-energy with souped-up Australian Fords and Kawasaki motorcycles screaming across barren landscapes in lethal chases. Max and his car, an evil-looking black supercharged coupe, wreak destruction on the outlaw bikers near the end and it's pure adrenaline by this point. The film may not be as polished or as wild as the \"Road Warrior,\" but it has cult appeal with the same flavor.This edition of Mad Max features the original voice tracks of the Australian actors that was never before available in the U.S. This surprisingly quite changes the atmosphere of the movie, making the characters more realistic in a sense, and far less animated when compared to the American dubbed version that feels more like an imported martial arts flick. I personally prefer this version....",

Since the movie's release to video and TV, many key scenes were cut from the original theatrical version. For instance, the scene where Max gets a chance to test drive the black beauty Interceptor and chases one of the bikers; he's full Nitro, the red light starts flashing, he's pushing the Interceptor to the limit, and then...she stalls out. Though devastated, this brought many a laugh from the audience. Another key scene: the abandoned Hall of Justice (police station); the brutal slaying of Max's fellow officers and Boss by the bikers. I've got both versions of this great film (foreign and domestic) and neither have the scenes that I just mentioned. Again, a great film...lets lobby for the original, uncut, Director's cut, whatever, of this film on its 20 anniversary!!!",

    "review/text": "MGM jumped on the DVD bandwagon rather late in the game, and the studio has been struggling to keep up ever since. Traditionally, MGM has released bare-bones, movie-only DVDs with bad transfers and horrid sound - but, thankfully, tradition seems to be losing out to what consumers want. Mad Max: Special Edition is the latest offering from MGM's film vaults to make its way onto DVD in a restored, high-performance disc, and it's about time, too.Mad Max will probably go down in history as the film that made Mel Gibson a star, but that would gloss over the film's many other virtues. A post-apocalyptic tale of good vs. evil, Mad Max features the title character, Max Rockatansky, in his job as an \"Interceptor,\" a kind of cop struggling to maintain order in a world where the government has all but collapsed and ruthless biker thugs and warlords have made normal life impossible. When Max kills a member of the gang, their leader, the Toecutter, turns around and butcher's Max's family. As a result, Max gets very mad and goes straight to kick-ass mode. The story is slick and well-told, with enough fast cars, gun battles, and extreme chases to keep you tied to your chair. It's basically a Western set in a decaying Australia, and it's a welcome change of pace for action fans, too.MGM presented us with a two-sided, dual-layer DVD that has two versions of the film: a gorgeous 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen transfer, and a full-screen copy on the same side for those who don't like to see the whole movie. For the first time, American audiences get to watch the film with the original Australian dialogue (it was dubbed with American actors for the US and never released with the original accents before now), either in the old-school mono mix or a completely redone, deep and dynamic DD 5.1 remix. On the other side you get two mini-documentaries, one about the Mad Max series and how the crews made the films (informative), and one about Mel Gibson's rise to stardom (blah). Round that out with a pop-up video style \"trivia track\" (really just a subtitle option), and you've got a great disc.The pop-up video track is one of the best and most innovative new features in a long time; I hope other DVD companies take note, because it's fun, informative, and you can watch it again and again, unlike most commentary tracks and other \"extras.\" Overall, Mad Max is an excellent disc, and at its current price, it's worth adding to your shelves. If you're an action fan or a post-apocalyptic-film fan, then this disc is a must.",

    "review/text": "I've been a fan of \"Mad Max\" since seeing it in the theater in 1980, and I pre-ordered this Blu-ray as soon as it was announced. The movie itself has been reviewed extensively elsewhere, so my review will cover, briefly, the Blu-ray disc only. I played it on aJVC XVBP11 Blu-ray Playerand watched it on aPanasonic TC-L32X2 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTVand, more recently, on aPanasonic VIERA TC-P42S30 42-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV.720p Comments:Overall it looks very dark. They didn't digitally correct any of the color errors (that is, spots in the movie where the film has color damage--it's really obvious after Max drags himself back to the car). The color is richer than on the DVD; skin tones look accurate, but the clouds look pinkish. And it's grainy, but still clearer than ever. You can actually read the graffiti on the high-fatality road sign, and read all the port rules on the beach sign. It's going to be a treasure trove for costumers and prop makers! The BD is definitely an improvement over the DVD in terms of clarity, but the price of that clarity seems to be all the visual noise that's now visible. (In many of the scenes where open blue sky is the backdrop, the sky tends to flicker.) I checked some scenes on the DVD and the color shifting and noise are there, too--it's just not as noticeable as on the BD. I suspect it's the very same source print.1080p Comments:Before I owned the 1080p plasma, I thought that having all that additional resolution would just make the bad qualities of the transfer that much more obvious. I was wrong. Frankly, it looks pretty amazing. There was less flickering of the sky, and print damage was much less obvious. The film still appears grainy, and overall the color is somewhat dull, but it IS a 30-year-old low-budget movie--a lot of which seems to have been shot on overcast days.Additional Disc Comments:The disc menu is odd: The footage is from the movie but the sound is sourced from who-knows-where (most of it is not from the movie, and doesn't even really match the visuals). And would someone tell me why they insist on including the abominable American dub in every release? (The only redeeming feature of the American dub--aside from its comedy value--is that some engine sounds were beefed up, and the characters' voices don't get lost in the mix as they do in the original.) The default audio is the original Australian track in 5.1 DTS HD. There's also a mono mix for you traditionalists.The DVD included in the set is the exact same one from theMad Max (Special Edition) DVD. (I compared them and the markings/numbers are identical.) Compared to the BD, it now looks a little washed-out. The chapter breaks appear to be the same for both discs.Conclusion:The question is, is this BD release worth the money? Well, if you're a die-hard completist or a hard-core fan like I am, the answer is yes. If you have a 1080p TV, then the answer is YES! If you're looking for the definitive Blu-ray release of Mad Max that's the best it's ever going to get, I'd say wait (or buy used). Maybe someday we'll get a loving, caring, comprehensive digital restoration by someone who doesn't care just about the sales numbers. But who knows how long that might take?",

    "review/text": "Before I wrote a review for this film I had to get my hands on a version with the original Aussie dialogue to see if it truly mattered. Well the answer is, yes it does. Other reviewers are correct when saying the dubbed version (in American English) makes the actors come off campy and it hurts the film a great deal. And yes, dialogue is even changed slightly, some more than others, like when the one kid and his girlfriend leave town in his hotrod with the biker gang hot on their trail. In the American version he says &quot;Don't worry&quot; to his girlfriend, but in the Aussie version he says &quot;No worries&quot;. I don't really think a dubbed English version was necessary. I could understand what they were saying even with the Australian accents. I mean imagine network TV dubbing Crocodile Hunter every week with an American accent...BAD IDEA! Now that the DVD is out of print (because ORION Pictures is out of business) let's hope Warner Brothers obtains the rights to this masterpiece, digitally remasters it (Dolby Digital 5.1 or better) and gives us the Aussie Soundtrack. Japan released this film on DVD with both Audio tracks (But in Region Code 2 only), so it's about time we got the same thing. In fact, Warner should re-release all three films in a nice box set and make them all special editions. The latest VHS version of The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2) included a retrospective documentary that was never included on the DVD. To me, this is a great film that deserves the S.E. treatment. It's hard to believe it was only Mel Gibson's 3rd film (After Summer City &amp; Tim). This movie is set during the decline of civilization and Mad Max 2 is set shortly after that when civilization is all but destroyed and scattered. Mad Max sets the standard for the sequals and truly gives us a man gone mad by the loss of loved ones at the hands of not just the bikers, but the decay of life as we know it. I love the trilogy...rare that each one is uniquely special in it's own right, yet still propells the character forward. Mad Max is a Classic, so Warner Brothers needs to get a move on with that remastered version (you know they won the rights to it) so people can see the original Mad Max in all its glory!....G'day!",

    "review/text": "For fans of George Miller's first &quot;Mad Max&quot; movie, this is the version for which we've been waiting more than 20 years for . . . the original Australian dialogue version. While the American voice actors tried to do their best to capture the characters and the synchronization was generally good, the dubbing, on the whole, lacks the subtleties that the original actors, speaking in their natural dialect, brought to the screen. Further, in the U.S. dubbed version, there was no appreciable attempt to change the Australian slang used thoughout the film, making the dubbing even more pointless than it already was.Beyond the new audio track, there is much more on this DVD to merit inclusion in your collection. The DVD presents the film in both anamorphic widescreen and full-frame formats. Now why anyone would want to watch &quot;Mad Max&quot; in full-frame is beyond me, but you can effectively recreate the VHS viewing experience of the last 15 plus years by selecting the full-frame video and U.S. dub audio options. There are also two newly produced, informative documentaries included, one on the making of the film and the other on the early Australian (pre-1980) film career of Mel Gibson. There's also a terrific audio commentary with several of the behind-the-scenes film crew members, including the Director of Photography, David Eggby. In one telling sequence, Eggby mentions that he had no idea how fast and dangerous the filming actually was while seated on the back seat of a motorcycle for a POV shot. It was only after he saw the daily rushes one day, that he noticed that the speedometer of the bike appeared in the shot and that it registered 180 kilometers per hour (approximately 110 mph)!The DVD also includes the usual trailer and TV spots, a photo gallery of international posters and lobby cards, and even a hidden, but not too difficult to find &quot;Easter Egg.&quot; All in all, MGM has done a superlative job on this &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD, easily exceeding, by a far margin, the two sequel DVDs released by Warner's (&quot;The Road Warrior&quot; and &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot;).",

The 'Cundilini wants his hand back' is a particularly humorous and those with a dvd player or decent video should freeze frame this part. Watch ou also for the fantastic stunts, especially at the start of the film as a V8 pursuit vehicle flies through a stationary caravan. If you liked this stunt, consider getting hold of the banned from T.V version of the vidoe of 'The Cardigans' 'My favourite game'. In this video, you will see many great automotive stunts, especially as a car flies through a parked camper van, Mad Max style. Unfortunately, many videos I have seen, namely the Warner Brother's edition in the three-box set, have been cut in a very crude and thoughtless manner, detracting from this film. I would agree with R KOEGEL and KENNETH MARBURY that a director's cut version, or any uncut version should be launched NOW. SO PLEEEEEASE make an uncut version of this film.",

Unfortunately nothing can save that painful &quot;brown shoes&quot; scene, but, hey, that's what the &quot;fast forward&quot; is for.If I had any problem with this version at all it would be that, since they moved it to 5:1 sound, sometimes the voices get lost in the background over music swells. It's one thing when dialog is drowned out by a roaring motor (that happens in real life), but when the actors are lost to an orchestral punch, it can be annoying.If you are going to get &quot;Mad Max&quot;, this is the version to get.

    "review/text": "So let me set the record straight about this version of the movie from Amazon's Instant Video. It is the original Aussie soundtrack, not an English dubbed version. Between all the different DVDs and downloads, if you are interested in downloading this one, be assured that it is not dubbed. It is however, pan and scan. What that means for those of you who have never watched movies on VHS tape is that the screen is formatted for a squarish cathode ray television with a 4:3 aspect ratio, instead of the standard 16:9 ratio for widescreen HDTVs. So when you watch this, you're going to get the black bars on both sides of the screen. Yes, at first it is \"widescreen\" for a few seconds, but then it changes for the rest of the movie. In my opinion, this doesn't hurt the presentation.The movie itself is a victim of the storytelling of the late 70s and obvious budgetary constraints. That's not to say that this is a bad film, but it doesn't really hold up today, even against your typical B-movie actioner. Some of the acting is way over the top to the point of being ridiculous. I'm thinking of the barechested police chief in the black leather pants and black silk scarf smoking a cigar and watering his plants and yelling at Max down the stairs while still holding his orange watering can. But I guess in Australia in the late 70s, this was pretty normal. I will say that the climax of the movie shows admirable restraint and I thought it was well-executed. The real draws here are Mel Gibson and the fact that this is the movie that sets the stage for The Road Warrior. That the Road Warrior came out of this movie is amazing. The quality of filmmaking rose proportional to the budget and what comes out of it is nothing less than a masterpiece. This movie, at the very least, has really awesome box art.",

Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as \"The Road Warrior.\" And \"The Road Warrior\" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today.\"Mad Max\" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today. This film is a classic in the \"action hero\" dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.",

Produced on a non-existent budget, this Australian film is set in a futuristic style of dust, poverty, lawlessness that we have now come to expect. The bad guys are just road marauders who exist to create havoc. The good guys are the cops (Mel) who are out to bring peace to the countryside. The movie is beautifully shot and directed, especially given the money they clearly didn't have. There's no CGI here. All the stunts are real stunt men and the driving sequences are first rate. Sure there's not much of a plot, but all hell breaks loose when Max comes back in the sequel. Stay tuned.",

    "review/text": "Before The Fast and The Furious, Speed Racer, and all of today's hybrid human/cgi rendered cars and blue screen chase sequences, there were films with real cars, real stuntmen, and Detroit gas guzzlers with Holly carburetors that made a lot of noise. Of these films, Mad Max and its follow-up, The Road Warrior, exemplifies the extinct breed known as muscle cars, or, in this instance, Australian muscle, mate!As a kid growing up, there was always something about the look of this film that turned me off: the desert, the dust, the solitary road, the mohawked freaks, the little ugly wild boy. But when I got older and a little more open minded, especially during a period when I became obsessed with car movies, I decided to give Mad Max, the so-called \"classic,\" a test drive and all I can say is WOW!!! There's something about the post apocalyptic setting of this film that makes those big muscular 70's cars look right at home, almost mythical. If you like the type of medieval hot rods that are primered, stripped down to the bone essentials--motors, tires, steering wheels, gear-shifters--then this is your kind of film.In a nutshell, Mad Max concerns a good cop (Gibson), member of the MFP (Main Force Police who surrenders to the dark side of his soul following a tragic incident. And if I add more to this I'll spoil the fun for those who haven't seen it. Can't say enough about this baby. Action, scary, prophetic, poignant, and beautiful can't begin to describe this film experience. When you see this film, it's easy to see how it launched Mr. Gibson into super-stardom.",

Interesting that while in the popular imagination the Mad Max paradigm has come to mean post-Apocalyptic chaos, in this first one, the world is more or less as normal as the Apocalypse hasn't occurred yet.3.

Mad Max is set in Australia, in the near future. It hasn't gotten as post-apocalyptic as Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, but you get a definite feel of bleakness and of the apocalypse. What Mad Max is, is basically a car movie. But what a car movie. The cinematography is great (and at times dangerous for the camera operator).As a dvd, the Special Edition is great (the reason I haven't bought Road Warrior is that I'm hoping they'll be releasing a special edition with the extras like contained on Mad Max). The commentary track doesn't have the director or Gibson, but it does have the DOP, Art Director, a film historian, and so on. They give a lot of great insight into the making of this film. There is also a 'trivia track' which flashes up trivia during the film. It also will point out every continuity error in the film. One of the great highlights of the dvd is that it is the original Australian recording (though you can access the American dubbing, but I think that is more for showing what dubbing does rather than to watch). There are a couple of featurettes and trailers. It's really a good dvd. And a great movie.",

I never looked at Mad Max like that. What i saw was a guy who was desperatly hanging onto the shreds of civility in a society that was becoming debased and uncivilised (one could liken it to living in Germany before the holocaust and coming out the other end) where security was insecure. Even Max wanted to quit Main Force Patrol because he likend himself to that of the gangs, where it was becoming increasingly impossible to distinquish between that which was good or bad. After Jim Goose and Max's family have perished you see a side to him that many of us can relate to - vengence. When he confronts the murderers in the closing scenes it is not with joy that retribution is extracted but with a righteous anger against that which is evil. All in all Mad Max is the original. The Road Warrior and Beyond (eek !!) Thunderdoom become over-shadowed by the fact that Mad Max leaves them for dead in the smoke from His Interceptor.",

It grossed $100 million worldwide in the last 30 years. It did this with few special effects, no computer graphics, no high paid superstar actors... It did it with a compelling plot, convincing acting, great character development, we can identify with the characters and their motivations, awesome vehicles, car chases (some of the best ever on the big screen) and stunts and it scores and A for creativity, especially the ending! Just thinking about it there are at least a few of the most amazing car chases ever, only to be outdone by RW. Aside from its sequel, The Road Warrior (which I would give 6 stars if possible), it's difficult to think of better post apocolypic or car chase movies that also have good acting and a real plot and character development. Can you even think of a cooler car than Max's V8? The other yellow and blue police cars are also so sweet.As for this one and RW, they were copied countless times which is impressive to say the least. For the movies weaknesses: RW avoided \"dating\" itself by disguising the cars and clothing so it couldn't be pinned on any specific date whereas Mad Max falls into the trap of appearing to take place in the 70's due to the clothing and autos and bikes. Some have complained about the dubbing. I have both versions, which are on this DVD, and actually prefer the American version over the Australian version. Either is fine though, honestly. Some say the movie is slow. In rebuttal, the slowness occurs in the middle and is character development, showing the bond between Max and his wife before she is murdered, to further explain why he goes after the biker gang to extract revenge and also to help the viewer like Jessie as a charater. If you took that out the viewer wouldn't be able to identify with the young mom, his love for her, and her brutal murder wouldn't be as powerful. I think the film wouldn't be as solid if you took that part out. Others have complained that the 'post apocolypic' world isn't nearly barren enough. To rebut that, it's very realistic and hints at the gradual downfall of man. We're witnesses the progression. Maybe some bombs have fallen somewhere else, maybe not. It's never explained but it's clear that there is alot of chaos. The fact that the viewer has to \"think\" for a moment, rather than being spoonfed exactly what happened, it an asset to this movie. The movie leaves it open to your imagination to tie it with the current world. Maybe it's nukes elsewhere, maybe oil shocks have tightened the grip of oil and has ruined the economy, maybe it's a global war not directly affecting this region and most able bodied men have enlisted, maybe it's biological weapons elsewhere... we just don't know, nor is it important to the storyline. Things are just really bad and society has decayed and that's all that's important. Civilization is in the process of decay. There are few cops left (presumably they've been killed or quit and not replaced, or left to fight a war and Max stayed because of his family), the highways are dangerous and overrun with gangs most people stay off the roads, the police station is in ruins and a state of disarray inside, etc. As for the viewer that said this movie was pointless, I don't understand his comment... This movie has as much \"point\" as any other movie. It's entertaining and thought provoking. And, unlike so many others, it's got a good plot, good acting, and phenominal stunts and car chases. An all time great made 30 years ago.",

    "review/text": "`Mad Max', an Australian flick and one of the very first movies to feature Mel Gibson has probably been seen by most people after they saw the two sequels, `The Road Warrior' and `Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome'. This circumstance has probably lead to a lot of misunderstandings about the circumstances of the original `Mad Max' plot.Basicly, the story is about the failure of an organized system of justice, leading to a downward spiral of individual, outlaw revenge and retribution. Unlike the relatively new post-apocalyptic genres exemplified by the latter two movies, the issues of revenge are as old as the classic Greek playwrights, all the way up through Eugene O'Neill's take on the old Greek story of revenge in `Mourning Becomes Electra'.There is but one little clue that this is a post nuclear war scenario. This is when we see a rusty and delapidated sign warning of a `Forbidden Area'. The only corroboration is the relatively poor condition of the sign over the entrance to the police station. Balanced against these minor visual clues is the spanking new sign over the door to the service station indicating that this is a licensed auto mechanic and the very clean and efficient looking hospital room and building.So, if there is any failure of civilization, it is largely metaphorical and seen in the failure of the constraints of lawful behavior to prevent a series of events based on unbridled libido and revenge.Of the `Mad Max' trilogy, the second, `The Road Warrior' is probably the best for many reasons, and it's connection to our current subject is loose at best and it's production values are far superior, but our original has an odd rawness about it which should not be confused with poor quality. TV stations would not be running this flick regularly if it did not have something special to offer.By far the most valuable currency offered up by `Mad Max' is the anxiety created for Max's wife and child in the last third of the movie. The fear is about as raw as it comes, with an odd similarity, based on the crude cinematic technique all the way around, with the terror of the original `Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. The horror movie is much less artfully done and draws a lot of it's impact from pure quantity of gore, but there is a strong sense that both movies gain from a lack of polish.Oddly, I think most of the juice in this movie comes less from Gibson's performance as that of the heavies. Unlike Harrison Ford's early appearances in `Star Wars', for example, I see little of the promise which Gibson shows in the second and third films in this series.I will go out of my way to watch the second and third movies, but the first, this `Mad Max' is really something of a guilty pleasure which survives rewatching and grows in stature as time goes by.",

    "review/text": "In 1981, THE ROAD WARRIOR was released in to the United States and became an instant hit, but George Miller's story of angry cop Max begins with his 1979 classic MAD MAX.Mel Gibson plays the title character, &quot;Mad&quot; Max Rockatansky, a cop in a postapocalyptic future (when exactly isn't specified). He's the best cop around, patroling the highways for speed-hungry gang members. Well, after his best friend is killed and Max steps in, the gang gets a little mad. In the end, Max (now gone a little beyond Mad) sets out to avenge the death of his wife and infant child, both killed by the gang.MAD MAX is a sci-fi classic that spawned one of the best-loved sci-fi series of all-time. Miller's directing style brings the needed impact to the seemingly dead futuristic earth. Gibson is also good in his star-making role (look at how young he is...wow!) - plus Brian May (not the Queen Brian May) contributes a good score.Top-notch sci-fi action entertainment and one of the greatest (and funnest) films to come out of Australia.

    "review/text": "1 DVD Disc & 1 Blu-ray Disc, released October 5, 2010\"Mad Max\" was one of the first movies to come out of Australia that got huge attention around the world and began the career of a star, Mel Gibson. It is the story of Max, a police officer in a time where bandits and lawlessness runs rampant who tries to get away from it all after something happens to his partner only to have more bad guys go after his wife and child leaving him only one choice -- get bad ass and take them all out in a big car action scene.Now it has come to Blu-ray with a DVD combo. The DVD has two featurettes - one on Mel Gibson as the \"Birth of a Superstar\" and one on \"Mad Max: The Film Phenonmenon\". When the film first came to the States, for some reason all the Australian voices were dubbed in American English! Are you for real, America??? Come on! It's not a different language, it's English for crying out loud! It's not like you can't understand their accent so even the great Mel Gibson superstar was dubbed over, geez. If you want to hear that version though, it is an audio option to switch to English dub. *smacks forehead*On the DVD is commentary with Jon Dowding, David Eggby, Chris Murray, and Tim Ridge where they go into detail about how certain stunts were performed and how they could only afford to put Gibson in actual leather clothes while everyone else was sporting vinyl. The DVD also has trailers, a Road Rants trivia and fun track, TV spots, and a photo gallery. The Blu-ray disc also has the \"Mad Max: The Film Phenonmenon\" and commentary with a clearer picture and sound.The difficult thing about a release like this now is that in all the bonus features talking about what a star he is, how beautiful, how talented, how much money he has made, it is all tainted with the reality of the public's current view of him after too many incidents have occurred that have tarnished his reputation as an actor, director, and producer. Mel Gibson was the first Australian actor to be paid a million dollars for a movie and the first actor ever from any country to be paid $25 million for a movie. It is true that \"Mad Max\" is a classic for high octane adrenaline action movies and was a forerunner for every \"Fast & the Furious\", \"Transporter\", and other crazy car movies. Not only did it reinvent action and the chase scene, it was one of the first apocalyptic movies which led the way for every other interpretation of what happens after....fill in the blank of a major event here as in \"The Book of Eli\" earlier this year.If you dig this classic, it's not a bad deal at all for all the stuff you get and you just have to listen to them raving about Gibson with an open mind if you aren't a big fan of his shenanigans right now. It was released both in DVD packaging (the one I was sent) and in Blu-ray packaging (which is the better deal).",

    "review/text": "Mel Gibson has made a career of playing Angry Mel--an initially decent man who, having suddenly and violently lost what he holds most dear, gets royally pissed and goes on a vicious, vengeful rampage--in movies from Lethal Weapon to Payback to The Patriot to Braveheart, but it all started with this one.Mad Max takes place in a dystopic future. Not the postapocalyptic wasteland of the later Mad Max movies, but a decaying, semiliterate society frighteningly close to our own. In this time motorcycle gangs, led by the sadistic, maniacal Toecutter, have taken over the roads of Australia, and the government (or what passes for the government) can barely manage to keep things just shy of anarchy.Only the Main Force Patrol (MFP), the police force, stands in the way of the gangs. However, they aren't much better, for in their mad pursuit of their quarry, they tend to leave a trail of civilian casualties in their wake, and they seem far more concerned with the thrill of the chase than maintaining the peace.In this world the only things that matter are speed and quick reflexes. Whoever has those rules the roads. Those who have neither, on the other hand, usually end up as flaming wrecks on the side of the highway.Into this state of affairs enters Gibson as Max Rockatansky, the top Interceptor on the MFP, who, with his fun-loving partner Goose, daily takes to the roads to pursue the Toecutter's gang. He seems to be a more decent sort than his fellow officers, hence more sensitive to the endless parade of horrors he sees on the job, but manages to hang on to his sanity thanks to his loving wife and young son. Of course this happy (?) situation can't last, otherwise we wouldn't have a movie...and you can guess what happens next.There are so many things to love about this movie: the brutal, suspenseful car chases (done on a shoestring budget and, even so, more inventive than what you'll see in most Hollywood action movies), the bizarre slangy, gabbly Aussie futurespeak, the crazed gangsters with their scruffy, outlandish punk costumes, and the garish, Wild-West-through-a-funhouse-mirror universe it all takes place in. As for Mel Gibson: if you ever harbored doubts the man could act, this movie should put them to rest forever, because he turns in a superb, fully-rounded performance here. But don't worry, for those who crave Angry Mel, he shows up too.Highly recommended.",

A rouge cop sets off on a suicide mission to take out these ruthless thugs after his wife and child are murdered out of spite by the gang leaders. As opposed to the over-the-top action that drove THE ROAD WARRIOR in the years to follow, MAD MAX is a much more character driven film, with all of the heart and soul that was missing from the subsequent sequels. Mel Gibson provides a powerful breakthrough performance as Max, a man pushed over the edge by hatred and grief. Director George Miller creates a series of dynamic chase sequences filled with incredible stunts and heart-racing suspense. While the film appears to be extremely graphic and violent, Miller tastefully implies the most horrific moments off-screen. In the most devastating sequence where Max's family is run down by Toecutter and his gang, the camera focuses on the road just past the action, as the bikers speed past and a small shoe and ball sprawl across the pavement. The combined effect of George Miller's fast-paced action, beautiful cinematography, and timeless revenge plot make MAD MAX one of the most exhilarating post-apocalyptic thrillers in the genre.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",

To me and more than a few of my friends who were into bikes back then (79 to 85) Mad max along with Quadrophenia made us feel like we were badguys (hey we were young). After watching Max and co young bikers across the UK attempted to emulate Max, Goose, Toecutter by being mean moody and more than a bit sad just as their predecessors had tried to emulate Marlon Brando (The Wild One) and Peter Fonda (Easy Rider) years before.The film although low budget is none the worse for that as it takes away some of the glitz that hollywood loves to throw into films and sometimes ruins by doing so (e.g. Thunderdsome Mad Max 3).The stunts are terific and the use of outback shots enhances the desolation the film seeks to portray. The acting is weak in some respects but the actors who portray 'the Goose' and 'the Toecutter' stand out even above Mel Gibson with performances that while believable are just the right side of over the top.The sound is excellent with good mood music work by Brian May. However in some places the speeded up driving and riding shots fail to work as well as they might. But in other areas the feel is just right e.g. Goose's ride out the morning after his night of passion with the nightclub singer.Overall a real groundbreaker which has rarely been beaten and which will still be remembered in years to come as a classic of Aussie cinema.",

A police officer who becomes disillusioned after the savage burning of one of his colleagues, he quits, but finds the gang have not left him. In horrific scenes, the gang hunts down his family, and Gibson returns to extract revenge, a necessarily determined and scarred loner.Max Max does not stretch out into many dimensions, but it contains a raw savage power and exposes something of the nub of the innate violence at the heart of man.

I've read that &quot;Mad Max&quot; has the highest return on investment of any film ever made ($100K to make, $100M in revenue generated); however, upon watching this movie, you will immediately be struck by its very low budget look and feel. If you've already watched &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;, you may want to watch this one to see where RW has its roots, but you really need to watch RW first. Leonard Maltin (in his RW review) states that Mad Max is at least as good as RW; he is crazy. MM is a great movie for having been made for $100K, but RW is a GREAT MOVIE, period. One more thing, this film is dubbed with American voices because someone, in their infinite wisdom, thought Americans wouldn't be able to understand Australian accents. This was a big mistake, as the American voice actors invariably overacted in their dubbing.",

    "review/text": "Would anyone have dubbed Alex from \"A Clockwork Orange\" just because he used a bizarre, otherwordly form of English? Or how about the childish drawl of Forrest Gump or Brando's slurred rasps in \"The Godfather?\" Of course not! They were integral parts of the characters, the settings, and the times of those films. So why, WHY were the distinctive, wonderful accents and slang of the Australian characters in the U.S. version of \"Mad Max\" dubbed over with, apparently, the voices of bland, Midwestern newscasters? Did the film's U.S. distributors think they'd fool us? That American audiences would hear Matt Lauer's voice coming out of Mel Gibson as he raced across the deserts of the Australian outback and not think, \"Hey! Those 'Americans' are driving on the wrong side of the road . . . and their steering wheels are on the wrong side, too!?\"Fortunately, this DVD resurrects the outstanding, original voices of the Australian actors and actresses, coming through, crisp and clear, in stereo, rather than the \"Hercules-in-New-York\"-ish mono of the American dubbing.If you've seen \"Mad Max\" before, and hated it or even just thought it was so-so, take a chance on this DVD and see it again in \"Australian-English.\" It's an almost totally different movie. Believe me -- I didn't particularly like it the first time I saw the dubbed, U.S. version, either. If you loved it, (pardon the cliche) see it again for the first time. You'll be transported into the surreal world of Australian outback biker slang that George Miller intended. And, trust me -- Mel Gibson sounds a LOT better with his own voice than that of the mellow, sedating NPR commentator (I can only suppose) they found to dub him.",

    "review/text": "The deterioration of society is the basis of the first Mad Max film. A dark vision of the near future, the film's low budget works in its favour: it feels real, props look suitably well-worn and there are no unbelievable settings or overblown special effects. The world the film is set in, with industrial decay, vast empty motorways and gangs of low-life bikers terrorising the remaining decent people left, is a deeply disturbing proposition. Mel Gibson, who looks remarkably young (he was 22) plays the title role - police officer Max Rockatansky of the Main Force Patrol, a specialised unit whose task is to rid the roads of the biker gangs who have brought anarchy to the cultural wasteland that they roam. Gibson's character has a wife and young son. They, like his colleague and friend, MFP Officer Jim Goose, are eventually hunted down and brutally murdered by the psychotic gang leader Toecutter, who holds Max responsible for the death of a gang member. The film moves towards its inevitable conclusion - Max is without all that was important in his life, so takes to the road once more in vigilante mode. This is a very unsettling film, devoid of Hollywood sensationalism. Two sequels followed, but the original movie, for me, has the greatest impact: a stark and gritty nightmare in a barbaric world that seems all too close to home.",

    "review/text": "When this movie came out, it became the biggest Australian movie ever. It won awards all over the world, and was given an &quot;X&quot; rating for violence in France. Its American releasing company, American International, was concerned that American audiences would not understand the Australian accents and slang, so they dubbed it with English voices. Then the company folded and in the fallout, the movie wound up being released only as the bottom half of a double bill on 42nd st. in New York City. This dubbed version is what most Americans are familiar with and what is contained on this video.The story involves a highway cop in a world &quot;a few years from now...&quot; where the roads have become dangerously violent. He worries that he is beginning to like the &quot;rat circus&quot; that the highways have become and goes on a vacation with his wife and baby. When his baby is killed and his wife turned into a vegetable by a biker attack, he puts his leathers back on and gets even, becomming...Mad Max.On a symbolic level, this movie can be seen as saying today's society is collapsing into a new dark age, much like the Roman Empire. The cops have become as violent as the outlaws: one shot of a cop shooting a road sign during a chase can be seen as symbolizing how the enforcers of the law are destroying the law; The chief lives at the top of a spiral stair, like a tower, much like ancient Emperors who were said to likve in tall towers, cut off from the chaos below. The collapse is accellerated (pun intentional) by man's relationship to machines, that man is becoming as unfeeling as machines. The cops shout to be heard over their engines; the bikers all wear helmets and gear that makes them look a part of their bikes; one cop, after an injury, speaks with a throat mike (the only voice not dubbed); even the slang: &quot;is she salvageable?&quot; &quot;stick to me like a tire on a licorice road,&quot; refers to automobiles. Interestingly, the black leather outfits of the cops, on character's ripped t-shirt, and various short haircuts and bleached hair represent one of the first examples of punk style used in a movie.The techniques for showing the chase and scenes were nigh revolutionary. Cameras were bolted to the fenders of the cars giving a &quot;wheel's eye view&quot; of the action. Quick cuts and close-ups are used a lot giving a hightened feeling of agitation and simultaneity. When a chase scene stops, you feel like you've been in it. Mush of the rest of the movie effectively uses techniques form other genres, such as horror, biker, cop, and western. Most of the most horrible violence is not actually seen, but rather implied by quick cuts, close-ups, and music. In a few key scenes horror movie techniques are skillfully used to heighten the mood of certain sequences, especially during Max's vacation on Aunt May's farm. The entrance of the Nightriders into the small town echoes &quot;The Wild Bunch,&quot; &quot;The Wild Ones,&quot; and &quot;These Are The Damned.&quot;I have seen this film in the theater, on video, on TV, and an Australian-language widescreen video. Of course the theater is the best place to see it. Commercial TV edits a piece or two here and there. The video that I saw had the box illustrated on Amazon. I got it second hand, but there were some quality problems with it that I can't be sure were not from the producer of the video (does anyone else have bad experiences with &quot;Goodtimes&quot; videos?). The Australian version said it had some footage not in the American version, but I couldn't find it. I did notice several things, however: There was a difference in some of the lines. The American version had cut some Australian slang out; The sound quality was better in the American version. The lines could be heard better; There were some additional sound effects in the American version that made the chase scenes more exciting; Though the bit parts in the American version were nortoriouly badly played, the main characters were (in my opinion) better played. The line readings were more interesting, having more character (or maybe I'm just used to them and was thrown when I tried to say the American lines along with the Australian actors).Footnote: In my high school Shakespeare class, I wrote a prequel to &quot;Mad Max&quot; using &quot;Richard III&quot; as the plot. The Nightrider was Richard.",

    "review/text": "A cult classic this, personally it's an all time favourite but I know a lot of people who hate it. A plot that is the stuff of westerns, Mad Max is set in the desolate near-future where the police are fighting a losing battle against psychopathic bikers who wreak havoc on anyone they feel like. Even when arrested the law is virtually powerless to contain the thugs and they are generally released without charge. Super-cop Max keeps his cool, even when his best friend is murdered, but when they see off his wife and child Max decides enough is enough, heads out in his super-charged V8 Interceptor (one of the coolest cars in cinema history), and embarks on a zero-tolerance one man campaign to wipe out the mad criminals. It's this finale that is the films main asset - Max is mesmerising as he relentlessly mows down all the bikers without giving them any chance of redemption. But the entire film is a real treat, with a weird atmosphere and some truly bizarre scenes, most of which involve the crazy bad guys, especially hilarious main baddie Toecutter. Unfortunately though this terrible American print which I recently had the misfortune of seeing - or more appropriately, hearing - ruins the film. The dubbing is truly awful, turning the whole cast into ham actors, altering parts of the script and even in occasional instances, bizarrely, omitting some of the sound effects. Oddly, this print is also the one featured in the most recent UK video release. I must stress that the only way to fully appreciate Mad Max is to hunt down a copy featuring the original Australian soundtrack and, preferably, in Widescreen.",

    "review/text": "It's not altogether surprising that Mad Max got such short shrift when it came out Stateside with an unfortunate dubbing job to eliminate the `Strine accents so American International could pretend it was an American film (Mel Gibson suffered perhaps a worse indignity with his screen credit moved to last position, just before the lab credit on the trailers). Much of what people remember and love about Max is delivered in the sequel rather than this first outing. Indeed, at times it feels more like a blueprint than a proper movie and Gibson barely registers in the surprisingly little screen time he has - the villains, who all seem to be doing either premature Danny Huston impersonations or somewhat more timely German New Romantic turns make much more of an impression. Not only do huge sections of the film keep him offscreen, but he makes little impact in his underwritten role when he is on. In many ways, this is just a first low-budget draft of Max's world - civilization hasn't entirely crumbled yet and the precious juice is still flowing even if parts are getting hard to find. Still, the car stunts are good, if somewhat thin on the ground, but this is one case where the sequels are definitely better.MGM/UA's special edition offers reasonable extras, but they are limited by the non-involvement of George Miller and Mel Gibson and the unavailability of any archive footage. The making of featurette and audio commentary from crew members are the best of the bunch while the Gibson featurette tends to be too much of a puff piece. Despite being listed as the Australian trailer, the theatrical trailer and the accompanying TV spots are all from the US release. Thankfully the original Australian soundtrack to the feature is included on this disc.",

    "review/text": "Y'know, when I'm in the mood to watch a good post-apocalypse movie with lotsa high-speed cars & `cycles, and plenty of collisions & explosions, I just gotta turn to the original `Mad Max' to satiate my needs! And the new DVD presentation of `Mad Max' does just that! Not only do I get both the original Australian AND US-dub voice tracks, I also get a better picture than what I used to see on my now-well-worn VHS tape of the flick! The picture isn't absolutely perfect, though, but this is more likely due to the quality of the original print than the quality of the transfer to DVD.Although I'm happy to finally be able to view and hear `Mad Max' in its original Australian dialogue, I have a certain sense of nostalgia for the American dub as well, as it gives the flick more of a weird Godzilla-like style & cheesiness to it! But if I had my `druthers, I'd take the original voice track. Why, you ask? Well, there's just something not quite right about an American-accented voice-over uttering \"strewth!\", you know? But never the less, I have fun switching back and forth between the two tracks as I'm watching. I'm amazed by how well-synchronized they are-- I click from Aussie to Yankee & back, and I miss narry a word of the dialogue! And yes, people, this IS my idea of a good time. Pretty sad, huh?Anyway, on to the special features. The commentary track contains the usual mix of anecdotes and behind-the-scenes memories that one has come to expect from movie commentary tracks. I was somewhat disappointed none of the four contributors was co-writer/director George Miller, but I guess I'll just have to deal with it. Then there's the trivia feature, which works somewhat like VH1's Pop-Up music video in that it comes on the screen every several seconds with a new factoid about the flick. Many of the trivia tidbits cover the make & model of the various cars, trucks, and motorcycles that appear here, as well as letting the non-Aussie viewer in on some of the native lingo that's heard here. Also mentioned are some of the technical aspects of particular scenes, as well as revealing where certain scenes were shot. Unfortunately, I've read that some of the lingo & location trivia bits are incorrect. Which is something of a letdown, but at least I've been given fair warning...Also included are a couple of documentaries which cover the making of `Mad Max' as well as taking a look at the early days of Mel Gibson's acting career. Like the commentary track, there's plenty of amusing anecdotes and details about the more technical parts of the movie, especially the great crash & collision stunts that one sees throughout the flick. One of the BTS doc's interviewees even refers to `Mad Max' as being \"porn for people who like fast cars\" because of all the high-velocity vehicles and stunts! Now that's a most unusual analogy if ever I saw (or, rather, heard) one! Other neat momes include the fanboy who bought and restored Mad Max's MFP Interceptor, and the prop that helped make the Toecutter's eye-popping demise so memorable!`Late!",

I am an auto-mechanic and a car buff, so I particulary love the car scenes in this movie, especially Max's black Ford Falcon Interceptor. Even though the blower on the engine is fake, you still love the car and how Max wipes out the motorcycle gang with it. This is a good movie, but make sure you get the original version, where all the voices aren't dubbed over.",

    "review/text": "This movie is the first of a series, it was made in and around Melbourne, Victoria Australia. The film was produced on a very small budget and showcases a number of Aussie stars, the most significant being Mel Gibson in the Title role. Although the storyline is good and simple, and the soundtrack was in Mono....this movie still has all the elements of a good storyline and believable characters. If you can get the original version with the Australian accents, you will enjoy this movie for years to come. Mad Max is still the highest grossing movie in Australia (when compared to actual budget).As an unashamed fan of the film I have even created a Windows Theme based on the film. END",

    "review/text": "\"Mad Max\" is the first of a trilogy, followed by \"The Road Warrior\" (1981) and \"Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome\" (1985). Very few people in the States saw \"Mad Max\" when it was released in 1979 because it only had a limited run here. Most Americans were introduced to the dystopian world of Mad Max with the release of \"The Road Warrior\" a couple years later.THE STORY: Ambiguously set in the near future after some sort of Apocalypse or social-economic breakdown, \"Mad Max\" focuses on the desolate regions of Australia wherein the police force, called The Bronze, try to protect what remains of society from a wild outlaw bike gang.\"Mad Max\" is perhaps the definitive cult film -- it's weird, raw, primal, ugly, low-budget and shuns explanation. Star Mel Gibson was a complete unknown at this point.WHAT WORKS:-- Director George Miller is imaginative with his unusual use of camera angles. I usually don't take note of such things so it has to be exceptional for me to notice.-- The costuming and locations are great, shot in the desolate areas of Victoria, Australia, including along the ocean shore.-- Although a bit cartooney, the filmmakers and actors successfully capture the utterly wild, looney and lawless nature of the bike gang, sort of reminiscent of, say, \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1971) and \"The Warriors (1979).-- The girls are fetching in a girl-next-door type of way.-- The scene where a mother and child are run over by the outlaw bikers is creative and memorable.WHAT DOESN'T WORK:-- The film has a really dated, low-budget vibe, especially the horrible score. One might argue that this is natural since it's from the late 70s, but that's not what I'm talking about. A film can obviously be from a certain period without being dated in the negative sense. Take, for instance, \"The Exorcist\" (1973), \"Jaws\" (1975), \"Suspiria\" (1977), \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979) and \"The Warriors,\" they're all plainly from that 70s era but they also transcend it. They're timeless films, pure and simple. Not so with \"Mad Max.\"-- My main problem with the film is its aloof air. As noted above, the story shuns explanation -- which is great -- but it does it at the expense of truly captivating the audience. The film's only 95 minutes long but I always have a hard time sitting through it; the story is good but it's presented in such a way that it fails to truly pull the viewer in.-- The vibe is often too over-the-top cartooney; I would have preferred a more realistic air. It's too obvious the filmmakers were shooting for an Australian \"A Clockwork Orange.\"This is not a negative point to me but it may be to some viewers -- there's not nearly as much action as rumored; there are many long, dramatic parts. In addition, what action is there is good but it's no more spectacular than pretty much any other 70's road/car flick or TV series.BOTTOM LINE: \"Mad Max\" is definitely worthwhile since it's the beginning of the popular trilogy and a definitive cult film, not to mention one of Mel Gibson's earliest performances. But, despite the many positives, don't expect to be blown away. It's decent but low-budget fare with a dated, aloof vibe.PERSONAL GRADE: C+",

    "review/text": "In the dystopian world of the future as seen through MAD MAX, the tough and crazy world we live in has become a lot rougher. Bandit gangs of motorcycle riders rule the roadways. They claim that anarchy and bedlam are the way to go. They steal cars, run over people, and rape women. The only thing stopping them from completely having their way is the Main Force Patrol (MFP), the last embodiment of law and order in the land. Driving vehicles full of swift and speed the MFP is the last line of defense in a world gone mad. The best member of the MFP is one Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) a cool officer with nerves of steel, a heart of gold, and a jewel of a sense of humor. Max succeeds in killing more thugs and bringing in more criminals than anyone else on the patrol. But even Max has his limits. After the death of a notorious criminal known as the Nightrider (Vincent Gil), his second-in-command takes over, Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and vows revenge. First they kill Max's partner and then they come for Max but kill his family instead. That puts Max over the edge and he doesn't just get even, he gets mad. At the end he drives away in his Interceptor and the legend of the Road Warrior begins.MAD MAX will always be known as the film that made Mel Gibson an international star. Until THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT it was also known as the motion picture with the highest cost-to-profit ration: the movie was made for less than $400,000 and earned well over $100 million. The shoe-string budget was even throughout the filming. For instance many of the cars used as police interceptors were constantly repainted for different scenes to pass as other cars and the blue van that is smashed in the opening car chase was writer and director George Miller's personal vehicle.The style of MAD MAX feels like BLADE RUNNER, but without all the cool gadgets. The world has fallen apart and each man must defend his own, but it's never explained why things are the way they are. Outside communication with the rest of the world has been completely cut off and though there are pockets of happiness to be discovered, one has to brave the roads and the roads are a dangerous and many times lethal place.The acting in MAD MAX isn't anything extraordinary, but it doesn't have to be. The movie has a solid script with several impressive car chases. The cheap budget helped grand the film in the bleak atmosphere it is portraying and gives it a grainy quality that is lacking in the other Mad Max films.I enjoyed MAD MAX and was quite impressed by how much the filmmakers were able to accomplish with so little. I think that ROAD WARRIOR (aka MAD MAX 2) is a better movie, but MAD MAX isn't a film to be messed with either.",

Unless society is expected to have TV after a nuclear war, the second and third ones are the post-nuke war installments. This film has a great start, lonnng middle, and a great end. The action portions of the film are the beginning and the end, while the portions in the middle are more like melodrama. Big exception is that some &quot;Action&quot; scenes are more like &quot;Horror&quot; scenes, especially the two kids being assaulted in their fire-paint car. The film does have a low-budget feel, with some film cuts being repeated. The dubbing doesn't help, though I thought I heard some Australian in the first chase scene [the crazy dude's chick riding in the passenger seat] and in the TV anchorman. Some of the music also seems over the top, too. For all its faults, it succeeds as a whole, and worth watching if you like action films.",

It is worth watching, even in the concededly awful dubbed over version, just to get the background to the later (and far superior) _Road Warrior_.In fact, _Mad Max_ is so overshadowed by the second film in the series that it is sometimes difficult to see it as more than a prequel.This film does, however, stand by itself. The villains are actually far more sinister and psychotic than those in _The Road Warrior_, and the disintegration of society is more appalling. Here, Max is still striving to uphold law and order but is pushed into vigilantism as a part of the same inexorable decay.The final scene/encounter is a classic, and a great segue to the next film.Editing and continuity are just a bit off, and the dub over is distracting.

    "review/text": "Let's go back....way,way back.Back before the Jew-hating rants,the philandering,the ugly divorce and the numerous drunk driving charges.Back before the ugly ticking time bomb that star Mel Gibson has become now.Mad Max is Mel Gibson in his acting infancy and while it is very difficult at times to separate the actor and his career from the films,separate we must.Trained in the more traditional classical style of stage acting(Shakespeare,etc)Gibson had debuted in films in just one role in /77 in Australia when he was offered the title role in Mad Max shortly after.Continuing working on the stage before,during and after shooting Max,Gibson,like everyone involved with the film including writer/director George Miller,were gobsmacked at the films impact.For just around a cool $1/2 million dollars,Millers' independent film company produced what would become an extremely profitable product way beyond their expectations.In fact it has pulled in to date over a $100,000,000! Gibson's career slowly lifted off the runway of mere acting mortals as he would go on to star in Gallipoli,The Year of Living Dangerously,the two sequels to Mad Max and then onto his Lethal Weapon series.And Gibson hasn't seen ground since,although some say his recent \"problems\" have crash landed him unceremoniously back to terra firma permanently.We shall see.Mad Max's premise may be a simple one but it has a certain je nais sais quoi,that draws you into the story and keeps you watching.Set in a future which is decidedly bleak(\"dystopian\" being the word often used),the film opens with an escaping convict and cop-killer called Night Rider,that is being doggedly pursued by the constabulary,this being the MFP(Main Force Patrol).Two MFP cars can't get the job done so it is up to their leather clad top pursuit man Max to get their man.And get him he does which ends with the convicts death in a fiery crash.The scene switches to a motorcycle gang which the now deceased Nightrider was a member of.The body of their former comrade is at a train station in a small town,which they are there to collect.However a young couple watching some of the mayhem some of the gang members are unleashing decide to make a run for it in their car.The gang's boss man Toecutter(played delicously by Hugh Keays Burn)sees them and order all bodies to hunt them down.They easily overwhelm the couple and one member decides to stay behind and have some fun with the female of the two.He is caught later at the scene by Max and his partner Jim,alias The Goose(Steve Bisley)and taken to be arraigned on charges.No sooner have they got their man than they have to let him go;no one turns out as a witness.The gang has a long memory and they eventually take out The Goose while he is trapped upside down in his vehicle as the result of a crash.Max is beside himself and he decides to retire.He turns in his resignation but his boss tells him to take some time off and then come back to reconsider.This he does with his wife and baby who go on an extended car trip around the countryside.While getting a tire fixed his wife goes to a nearby store to get some ice cream but its molested by none other than Toe Cutter and his gang.She barely escapes and they flee the area.They end up at a relatives farm but the gang has followed them there.While coming back from the beach through some woods Max's wife is being chased and he hears her screams.She manages to reach Max who whisks her into the house while he goes in search of the perps.However they have done a runaround and are waiting at the farmhouse.Wifey flees but her car has been tampered with and as she runs away from her broken down vehicle,baby in arms,the motorcycle gang run her down in the middle of the road.Arriving at the scene too late Max is filled with rage.He returns home with one thing on his mind;vengeance.He re-suits up,gets an even more jacked-up pursuit car and heads out to get his pound of flesh.He dispatches the gang members first in a group then he goes after the two important ones;Toecutter and the guy who killed his partner;in that order.Toecutter gets his kissing the front grill of a semi,while Max hand cuffs the other one to an overturned truck,dripping petrol.He rigs a little something up set to explode in a short time and gives him a hack saw.He tells him he can either cut through the hand cuffs in about ten minutes or saw his handcuffed ankle off,which should take about five(shades of \"Saw\"!).The last shot of the movie is from the front hood of the car looking back at Max and the scene behind as he drives away.Of course the inevitable explosion occurs with the audience yelling an in-tandem\"Yesss!\".But Max's face is not smiling;it's full of angst,pain and the memories of the past 24 hours as he drives off to......who knows where? Fade out.As I mentioned before while this story may be simplistic at times,and while there are many moments that reveal its' low budget roots,this a movie you just cannot stop watching.Just when other lesser films would fade into some irrelevant love scene or other padding,this one has that hook that just won't let you walk away.You often wonder what is going to happen after such and such a moment and you may even KNOW what is going to happen,but it makes no difference.The film's rawness and punch always keeps itself on track.There are no apologies here and some of the more violent scenes are what they are because they BELONG there.This DVD set comes packaged with the Blue Ray disc also.The Blue Ray is a single sided disc while the DVD version is a dreaded two-sided double disc,and is on the bottom holder of the two.One side contains the film,in TWO versions:widescreen(2:35:1) and full screen.The other side is devoted to features only.Specials include:commentary,a special Max Facts track,photo gallery,TV spots,original trailers and two featurettes,one on Gibson career and the other about the Mad Max phenomenon itself.The Blu Ray disc has only the film,commentary and the Mad max phenom featurette.The film itself has restored Gibsons voice which was dubbed over in later versions and some cut footage.It now runs closer to 91 minutes than the previous 88.The transfer is beautiful and the print they use here is pristine.This is Mad Max they way it was always intended to be shown.In short this career starting,adrenaline pumping Mel Gibson vehicle from /79 is a winner all the way.Sure it's an indie film and shows its' slip more times than not but its' compelling storyline will have you riveted to the screen from beginning to the end.As the first of three Mad Max films(a fourth is said to be in the works!),it is a must have.",

Being nine years wiser since my original review posting to this website, I still can't understand why some one (perhaps George Miller himself) doesn't produce an uncut, definitive version of this film on DVD. However, since we're talking about a 30 year old film, personal priorities and what's happening in the world itself, perhaps there's no interest anymore in classic cult cinema. I sit here typing this message today while watching my DVD version of the film knowing that filmmakers are bound by certain rules when putting stories to film. However, one can hope and dream...can't they. Here's a hyperlink to a website that speaks to those cut scences I told about in my original 1999 posting: http://www.madmaxmovies.com/making/madmax/CutScenes/index.html.

    "review/text": "That's where it all started. In Australia and nowhere else. And I must say that landscape is impressive. It was science fiction at the time and it no longer is. In spite of all, we have grown into that kind of frantic frenzy, criminally biased and with no one to stop them. We are today speaking, and have been for a while, of a new criminal organization, a new mafia, a new gangsterism and it has come not to the desert but to our cities, to our suburban areas. These new criminals do not want power, control, or even influence. They just want to make money and to get the thrill of absolute fear around them, no matter what thrill actually, but the thrill of robbing, killing, blowing up. They have no political motivations like in the late 60s and early 70s. They just want to feel blood on their hands and smell powder in their nostrils. They are not even well organized as money making criminals. They take tremendous risks and don't even hide their tracks. Being run after by the cops is fun and they can kill one from time to time, a pregnant young female cop if possible. We have fully entered the modern criminal urban civil war and we better move our heads and rake our brains if we do not want them to take over whole neighborhoods where the law is going to be their law. That's exactly what Mad Max is showing and demonstrating. That's our future, that's already our present. If you don't believe it just check with Grenoble in the Alps or wherever there has been an \"incident\" (it should be called an ambush or a battle) of that type. What's more Mel Gibson had seen that the good ones in our society, those who have authority will most of them decide that it is going against the human rights of these new criminals if we want to shoot them when they have a bullet proof vest on and a heavy automatic gun in their hands. Some in the press even believe you must - not should, mind you - ask them for permission before shooting at them, and they no longer use light guns. They use heavy military weapons. Some even call themselves the barbarians of the latter days and one of these gangs (all the members are in prison right now) tortured a young Jew to death over several days just because he was a Jew, and the leader of the gang managed to go back to his homeland in Africa to find refuge, which he luckily did not find because he was extradited back to France and what tried for his crime. There is only one way with these: get the wolf out of the wood and declare the hunting season open and that species of wolves no longer protected except if they surrender and put their weapons down BEFORE killing, or even wounding, anyone. That sounds harsh but I have lived through the end of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, a piece of the end, and I can tell you there is nothing else to do because anyone of them who will manage to get out of the final stand in which they are trapped will start shooting again tomorrow morning as soon as they walk free on parole. France has had its batch of terrorism in the late 80s and early 90s but Mesrine was not tried and a few others were not either. I regret Carlos was. That kind of an outlaw does not really deserve a trial. I am told we must respect the human rights of these criminals. I could if their crimes were crimes of passion. But their crimes are crimes of blood, of greed, of absolute destruction. Mad Max got them all. Good. Unluckily that will not bring the victims of these barbarians back to life, will it?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",

    "review/text": "Mad Max is a interesting little piece of movie history. While the script isn't all that compelling and the movie itself is obviously in the low budget arena Mad Max still stands out. Why? Because the movie for one doesn't try to be more than what it is. It's about fast moving vehicles and the heroes/villians who ride them. Move just a step above that and you get character development from both sides. Not much beyond that, but again the movie doesn't pretend to have more.This is Mel Gibson's first starring movie role and he took the world by storm. This movie was a perfect vehicle to launch Mel's career. It gave him a chance to play the hansome hero with a full range of emotions (which he pulls off quite well). If it weren't for Gibson this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as good. Sure you get some good supporting actors, but lets face it. This movie is about Max, and Max has to carry the story.The supporting cast for Mel isn't just the actors, but the vehicles as well. The police in this destopic future ride in fast interceptor cars. The bad guys are a nomad bike gang riding in various motor bikes. Max gets a really sweet car that becomes his trademark in not just this movie but the sequel as well. The cars definitely have character and the way they are filmed shows it. The chase scenes are fast and furious. No speeding up the cameras to make it look fast here. This is the sort of excitement the movie excels at.My only complaint is that Mad Max ends up just being a series of events that happen one after the other. The tie ins are sparse and the script is weak because of it. Then again this isn't Gone with the Wind. Still I have to at least mention it.This DVD is a must have for any MM fans. Not only do you get the American released english version, but you also get the original Australian dub. Of the two the original comes out on top. Not because the \"American\" dub is bad. It's actually pretty good in the sense that the voice actors did a good job of it. The problem is the American version was done in mono and you don't get nearly as much environmental sounds and background noises as you do in the original. Also the Aussie dub is in stereo, which beats out mono anyday.The DVD also comes with a couple featurettes that really hit home for the fans. One is more about Gibson and one is more about the movie. Both are very informative documentaries. I think even longstanding fans of Mad Max would find some new info in these.To be honest Mad Max is not for everyone. If you demand blockbuster budget Hollywood style movies this isn't it. If you demand high art or deep stories you won't get it here either. However if you can get into a low budget movie that did one heck of a job in the car chasing department or are a fan of Mel Gibson then this is the movie for you.",

    "review/text": "\"Mad Max\" (1979) is a remarkable sci-fi actioner starring Mel Gibson, fresh from Sydney's National Institute of Dramatic Arts, and directed by George Miller, a film buff with film school training. Gibson plays Max Rockatansky, a loner cop patrolling a post-apocalyptic Australia. The highways have become the arena for death games between nomad bikers and cops like Max, along with his partner, Goose (Steve Bisely). Enter the Nightrider (Vince Gil), a vicious biker escaping custody. He has just stolen a car from the Main Force Patrol (MFP) headquarters. A road chase between Max and the Nightrider results in the death of the latter. Unbeknownst to Max, Nightrider's buddys come to town to seek revenge. They are headed by a demented lunatic named Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne). His followers are the mysterious Bubba Zanetti, the drug-addled Johnny the Boy (Nightrider's replacement; not yet a full member), and psychopathic rapists/homosexuals Mudguts, Cundalini, Starbuck, and Diabando. Whilst seeking vengeance upon Max, they wreak much havok along the way. This includes an assault on a young couple, and the slaying of Goose. A horrified Max quits the force, and takes his wife, Jessie (Joanne Samuel), and their baby Sprog, on a much-needed vacation. Unfortunately, Jessie is almost raped by the Toecutter and his gang, but she doesn't tell Max what happened. Rather, the Toecutter gang catches up with them and viciously murders Jessie and Sprog, leaving Max with no choice but to embark on an explosive path of vengeance upon his tormentors. The biker gang is completely without empathy, except for Johnny the Boy, who became a full gang member only after reluctantly setting Goose on fire. The Toecutter is perhaps the creepiest, nastiest villain to ever grace the screen, while Bubba Zanetti epitomizes the ruthless killing-machine whose mission to destroy Max. The other bikers are no less sadistic than the Toecutter. The movie works mostly because of Gibson's performance as the damaged hero, Max. It also features great effects and remarkable stunts, and spawned an even more successful sequel, The Road Warrior (1981). Overall, a very good action film. Only quibble: actors' voices were re-dubbed with American voices, out of fear that audiences wouldn't comprehend the Australians' accent.",

Parts tend to drag near the end, but only for a few minutes, and its right back to the action. It is basically a revenge story, but its quirks really make it work. It is just different from other movies of the same ilk. I particularly like the characters' comic book style looks and action, and the screen wipes help make the movie seem more like an old fashioned style serial. Worth watching if you like Mel, cars, or action. I didn't hear a whole lot of difference between the American dubbed version and the Australian version, except for a few minor dialogue changes.

This version will probably always be available but if you ever have a chance to see the original or even own it, you are in for a true delight. The Aussie dialogue is not as difficult as &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; but can be hard to understand at times but you get what they are saying. Also, there are several key sequences that were edited that adds to the tension (hence forth the horror genre). Although, some would disagree, a director's cut is certainly deserved to this cult classic, one that restores the the original sounds and lost(?) edited scenes. MAD MAX is definitely a high energy movie that every guy should own. There is real movie magic at work here while still displaying an artistic approach(an angle rarely explored in action movies of years since its premier.)",

Ruthless Biker gangs wreak havoc and mayhem, with only a small scattering of pursuit special police to stand up against them. Mel Gibson (in his second feature film) plays Max Rockachansky, a cop who wants to quit the road, but is drawn back in when his family is slaughtered. Having grown up in the country of this movies origin, I was always going to approach this particular title with some doubt. Mostly due to fact that the dialogue for Mad Max in Australia remains untouched, unlike the US where it has been dubbed. But surprisingly enough, I found myself drawn in, mostly because the dubbed dialogue is the same as the original script, with maybe some Australian terminology removed in a few spots, plus changes and additions of new dialogue when the face or mouth of characters are not in the camera shot. So mouth flap is well accounted for, but the dub occasionally stands out like a sore thumb. An example is when Jim Goose(Steve Bisley) is in the cafe at the start, speaking with his mouth full. About 98% of the dialogue is still there, which leads me to ask, &quot;Why did they dub it?&quot;. And more importantly, &quot;Why have they not released a DVD version with the original actors voices, given the success of one particular actor?&quot;. In any event, the movie, dubbed or otherwise, is still a top actioner. I give a full five stars to the original version.",

The remastering process was done so well, it looks like a movie filmed in the 90's! It actually looks better/newer than my Batman and Matrix DVD's. Lots of trivia too. Something else you should know is that this movie was put together with a budget of $200k odd US dollars, volunteer riders and many rookie actors, and it still managed to become an inspiring cult classic. This was a great low budget film brought to life by the talented George Miller/Byron Kennedy team.Watch this movie along with it's sequel The Road Warrior and you will not be disapointed, you may skip &quot;Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome&quot; because by the time this movie was made, Byron Kennedy, the producer to whom its dedicated, had died and Hollywood's save the -lil' childrens- big budget hype ruined the rest.The intro to The Road Warrior best explains why this DVD is a must see...&quot;To understand who he was, you have to go back to another time.&quot;",

The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan &amp; scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you've seen this movie in the past and thought, 'It was OK' this new DVD will have you saying, 'It was great!'",

The couple who are later attacked by the biker gang are having sex in a field - one of the good guys appears watching them from a distance and shouts over to them. This scene appeared before the first chase scene, and is missing from this version.The transfer appears to be a transplant from a poor quality laserdisc version, and the sound is in mono.What appalled me was the American dubbing - this seems typically arrogant and ignorant to me. In any other country in the world you would not find this, and its unfair and condescending to the portion of Americans who wanted to see the &quot;unbutchered&quot; Australian version. I have seen this dubbing in the States with English programmes as well (leaving the evil characters with the English accents of course) and its frankly offensive to watch.DON'T BUY THIS DVD - WAIT FOR SOMETHING BETTER TO BE RELEASED!",

    "review/text": "I remember seeing \"Mad Max\" in the spring of 1980. Now this was the days before multiplexes. \"Mad Max\" was distributed by American International Pictures, Samuel Z. Arkoff's outfit whose forte was drive-in fare i.e. Grade B action and horror films. I was seventeen at the time and the way this film was promoted was appealing to me. The TV commercials were full of car chases and fast action. When I saw the film naturally it was a real rush. It didn't disappoint in the action department and the good guys were good and the bad guys were vile. Something seemed a little off to me, though. The landscape didn't look like anything that I was familiar with in America. The speaking parts seemed a little off even though they were distinguishable American accents. One of actresses in a minor role, Sheila Florence(May) was familiar to me from a popular Australian women's prison soap-opera from that time,\"Prisoners of Cell-Block H\". Never mind. If this film was reviewed at all it was generally dismissed as exploitation trash. I forgot about this film completely until I read a review of it in \"Time\" magazine, I think it was Richard Schickel, a couple months later extolling the virtues of this high-octane action thrill-ride. The next I heard of Mel Gibson he was appearing in the highly praised \"Gallipoli\" this time speaking in an Australian accent. Summer of 1982, \"The Road Warrior\"(or \"Mad Max 2\" as it was known overseas) was released to better box office and critical acceptance. Home video was breaking at that time and both \"Road Warrior\" and it's lesser received original were released around the same time. The legend continued to grow. I watched \"Mad Max\" numerous times over the years and always enjoyed it but those bogus accents were always a detriment even as Mel Gibson's celebrity continued to grow. I'd watch it and try to imagine what it should sound like by inserting in my mind Mel Gibson's actual voice instead of that lame dubbed voice. Now,finally, we have the version that should have been available all along, \"Mad Max\" in all it's down-under glory. For those who don't remember the original \"American-version\" of \"Mad Max\" don't even bother to seek it out. I don't feel the least bit nostalgic for it. This is the \"Mad Max\" that should have been available all along and we can leave the old \"Max\" to the garbage heap.",

Well, that was false information, because after all the time, effort, and money it took to track down that elusive version, it turned out to only play in the US Dubbed English Language track! So disregard the information in that review and buy this one.PROS: Plays in both Fullscreen and Widescreen!In addition to the US Dub, this DVD contains the option to switch the Language track to the original Australian track!Contains 2 Documentaries, \"Mel Gibson: The birth of a Superstar\" & \"Mad Max: The Film Phenommenon!\"Theatrical Trailers.Audio comentary with Jon Dowding, David Eggby, Chris Murray, & Tim Ridge.\"Road Rants\" Movie Trivia & Fun facts about the movie!Photo GalleryTV SpotsAnd More!CONS??? Well... Since the DVD is double sided, it's harder to hold it without smudging it, I guess that's a con...?Overall: Mad Max is an excellent movie that's fun to watch, easy to follow, easy to appreciate, and exciting to boot! Combine that with the original Australian language and a whole lot of special features, and all you have to ask yourself is, \"Do I want my popcorn buttered, salted, or both?Overall Rating: 5 Stars!",

It's rather humorous that a film that seems so low budget to us today can be as entertaining and riveting as this one is. Watching this now, for the fourth or fifth time, I have to say that this very young Mel Gibson, did he not already possess a legitimate level of talent, would not have been so believable in this role due to his physical appearance. His polish and chiseled features really don't fit in amid the band of miscreants that is the cast, but we soon forget our initial impressions due to his performance. The people in Mad Max are far closer to man's actual state than most of us care to admit. The audience can completely relate to Max's reaction at the end of the film and we cheer for him and long to press our feet even more heavily upon the accelerator.",

    "review/summary": "Is Max really mad, or merely just misunderstood?",
    "review/text": "\"Mad Max\" is one of those films that is on everyone's top film lists. Not only did it introduce us to Australian cinema, but also a young 21-year old newbie named Mel Gibson. \"Mad Max\" was dark, it was brooding, it was destructive, and it never gave us that glimmer of hope for humanity, but now - nearly 20 years later - does it still remain the classic that it started? Sure, it was impressive to watch the crash scenes, it was powerful to see the world through Mr. Miller's disturbed eyes, but is it re-watchable? Does it have the appeal to see new things throughout if watched and watched again? For me, the answer seemed to float near \"no\". While I loved what \"Mad Max\" represented, what it was - a full body of color and action - it wasn't something to be watched again and again. Gibson does a great job as Max, a man torn between the evils of the road and his personal philosophies. He begins as an ominous optimist, able to stop crime as it occurs on the streets, but then as his sense of normality is turned upside down, his ability to react and adapt is seen. The final moments, he has transformed from the man we were first introduced to into something quite terrifying. One could also compliment Mr. Miller's directorial outing, at times it felt a bit episodic with tough edits placed, but for the majority he told a deathly story with great ease and excitement. So, again, there is no arguing that \"Mad Max\" is an important film, one that I am glad to have finally seen, but once was enough. It seems to be lacking that re-watch excitement.But why has that conclusion been made? What makes \"Mad Max\" mediocre instead of powerful? It is hard to pinpoint the exact scene, but the sense of \"alright, I've seen it - now what\" was definitely present by the end. Yet, there were points that I just loved. Gibson was perfect. He was incredible as Max, and the world that Mr. Miller created was intense. The opening scene, the car crashes as our bearded villain just yelled \"Toecutter\" was fantastic. \"Mad Max\" has one of those openings that just pulls you in, that makes you excited to watch a film of this intensity, but then where do you go? Miller seemed to indicate that more car crashes, more violence, more cliche family drama would indicate a stronger film. At times he was right, his ability to create different scenes set across the same backdrop demonstrated his originality, but then there were times where it just felt recycled. One scene that stands out, is where our gang of bikers track down a couple that happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, they chase them down and demoralize them as Max and his partner find them - then, almost repetitively, it happens with Max and his girl later in the film. In this post-apocalyptic world, there seems to be no problem finding someone. Space seems to not be a problem. This was another unexplained moment - where the coincidence of discovering Max or finding the biker gang should have been more difficult. These repetitive, essentially simplistic scenes seemed to detract from the power of what Max represented. One also needs to ask about the story, the unknown of what time or place we are following Max - would this have strengthened the story knowing what world we lived in? The understanding that this was a low-budget film was rooted in my mind, the techniques provided were impressive, but should that have been neglected for mediocre storytelling? Perhaps I misread this film, perhaps I missed the joy of why this is hailed as such a cult success.Another weakness against \"Mad Max\" has to be the relationship between his wife/girlfriend and child. Again, the lacking story helped confuse this viewer as to what dynamic they had, but when we have scenes in which the child is completely forgotten about - it just decimates the reasons behind Max's anger and utter breakdown. There were several scenes in which I yelled at the screen, \"What about the child\", then finally they would remember - he seemed to fade in and out of existence too often for one film. Then, when disaster strikes, we are forced to believe that suddenly Gibson would release his inner rage? It just didn't work. The same can be said for his wife/girlfriend. A stronger definition of character, and even more lines spoken would have helped me see the relationship. She seemed angry at first, the product of a failed marriage forced by this post-apocalyptic world to stay together, then we were introduced to love, then suddenly, she moved to idiocrity. Who would believe that running down a road, when there are open fields around, is the better option? It was these small inconsistencies that forced \"Mad Max\" from greatness to just another average action film. Two-plus hour sweeping epics aren't always needed, but stronger characters do help in creating the world that we, as viewers, are to inhabit for 90-ish minutes.Finally, applause are in order for the villain in this film. The portrayal of Toecutter by Hugh Keays-Byrne was outstanding. The small attention to detail as well as his ability to make you feel like he would do anything to get his way - similar to the portrayal of Joker in \"The Dark Knight\" - was an up moment for this film. Like a roller coaster, \"Mad Max\" had these ups and downs, curves and jerks, and when it was all said and done, you really had to question whether you were going to ride it again. \"Mad Max\" is an important film, there is no question in my mind about that. The door that this film opened for future cinema in America couldn't have been done by a better group of filmmakers, but it isn't a promising classic. I could not watch this film again. The sequels I am ready for, but this ride is over - and the park is closing. I realize that I am in the minority, but \"Mad Max\" is a low-budget film that uses repetitive filmmaking as its staple - originality is present, but you must search to find it.Grade: *** 1/2 out of *****",

But the seeking revenge part is just about 4 or 5 scenes towards the end of the movie! And to top it all off it seems like the apocalypse has had absolutely no effect on the world, because trees are growing, there's power, water, civilization, medicine, and ice cream! Jeez!",

    "review/text": "I like the _Mad Max_ series, but I think the two sequels are better movies than this one.It's not that it's _bad_. It's just that it consists mostly of an hour and a half of atmosphere. Another film would have had this entire plot take place in the first half-hour and gone on from there.The idea -- a postapocalyptic mood piece set in the Australian Outback -- is wonderful, and naturally enough the scenery is gorgeous. And considering the shoestring the movie must have been made on, it's very good. It's just not much fun to watch twice, because it takes so bleedin' long for anything to _happen_.The best thing about it is the young Mel Gibson, who perfected the likeable-handsome-lug persona a generation ahead of George Clooney and who plays Max with just the right combination of rogueish charm and leonine ferocity. When he finally _does_ go 'mad', his puckish humor evaporates and he burns like a slow and deadly fire.The rest of the cast does well too -- and having previously owned this film on VHS, I'm glad that the DVD special edition includes the original voices. The thick Strine may be a little hard for U.S. audiences to follow at first, but once you pick up the wavelength you won't have any trouble. (Besides, the old U.S. dubbed version is available as an option.)Anyway, as a longtime SF geek and an avid devourer of postapocalytpic films and novels, I really like the atmosphere and the concept of this movie. I just have a hard time watching it too many times close together. For that, I prefer the two sequels.But this one is still worth watching, and owning, for the story it tells -- the mythical tale of the birth of one of modern cinematography's great heroes/antiheroes.",

But here max is truly broken, insane not in a wild sense but almost emotionless. he has completely snapped and deserves the title of Mad Max. and to those who haven't seen it SPOILERS AHEAD if you don't want to know...just had to throw it in there...the fact that only his child his killed, his wife is still in critical condition when he breaks off into revenge adds to it. all the more unsettling that way. you have to love DVDs for their tendency toward widescreen. it adds to the experiance. the image is crystal clear and if only they could throw on the original dialogue track...i'd have a definitave version.",

    "review/text": "As Bob Denver, for all practical purposes, became \"Gilligan,\" in real life -- as Frances Bouvier became \"Aunt Bea,\" and Bob Keeshan \"Captain Kangaroo\" -- the young and beautiful Melvin Gibson, in this earliest of roles, was incredibly, unbelievably fortunate to avoid career-long typecasting as nothing but a cheesecake, eye-candy, silver-screen pretty-boy.This fine debut film, in which Melvin Gibson had to do little more than look extremely nice, exude male lusciousness and wear tight leather pants, came dangerously close to relegating him to Fabio status, committing him to a relatively brief film future of appearance-only, stand-and-model roles in subsequent movies. However, the overwhelming power of Melvin's acting talent (facial expressions, talking, walking, and driving vehicles) -- the raw guts of thespian talent and drive -- managed to save him from a perpetuation of calendar pin-up roles, catapulting him to an infinitely higher plane of cinematic accomplishment than is accessible by a mere male model (see Bird On A Wire, The River, Lethal Weapon VII, etc, Melvin's list is literally endless).It was that determination which wrenched Melvin Gibson out of the male-model mold and elevated him to Oscar quality. Think of Gomer and Goober Pyle, of Herman Munster, Dan Rather and Sheila Jackson Lee... and see how intertwined, how enmeshed, how tied up those actors became with their roles. Melvin Gibson was lucky to avoid the same sort of typecasting that severely restricted the careers of these unfortunate folks, and would have condemned him to being known for the rest of his life as nothing but a darn good looking hunk of meat (as they say).We all knew Goober Pyle -- and we can all say for a definite fact that Melvin Gibson (Mad Max) is no Goober Pyle.",

In this part of America, especially in small town rural areas, you can almost get the feeling that we are living in this future. Many people in the midwest scrounge and save their meager earnings to be able to afford to fill their gas tanks just so they can drive to their jobsite. The desolation of the area in which the movie was filmed makes this movie eerily believable and I often am reminded of the look and feel of the film when driving through some small midwest American \"ghost-towns\".

    "review/text": "As an Aussie who saw this as a boy way back in 1980 I am saddened and dumbfounded to find that this was ever the victim of pathetic overdubs into US speak from the original Australian, as though this helped the film in any way? Was the premise that Americans are so jingoistic that they aren't capable of understanding English spoken by Australians, or simply that Americans only want to hear themselves? In any case this is a classic Aussie film back in the days when Mel Gibson considered himself an Aussie and was seen by Aussies to be an Australian.I won't harp on about the plot because other reviewers have done the plot to death. This film was shot in South Australia and the many brilliant and genius techniques for filming the amazing road scenes were developed by the Australian Director of this movie, later to be adopted by film makers the world over. Anybody who doesn't understand that this movie is the BEST of the series has missed the point of MAD MAX as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure Aussies and Kiwi's alike understand the superb grittyness which has the stamp of Australian and New Zealand (Once Were Warriors) film making all over it without losing all the best features of great film making to HOLLYWOODISM...MAD MAX 2 was also a good film but Thunderdome became too Hollywood for my money and sadly doesn't do justice to the series like the original. I almost feel sorry for people who thought this wasn't ans Australian film... it's like thinking \"Gone with the Wind\" was Canadian and sticking \"eh\" on the end of \"Quite frankly I don't give a damn (eh?), talk about inappropriatsville! This is the the ONLY version worth watching...",

    "review/text": "MAD MAX may actually live up to that boast. This was Mel Gibson's first role in an action film, and one of his only Australian films. The movie takes place in a post-apocolptic world where the cops just basically get their [bootys] kicked by road rats, who pretty much rule the highways. \"Mad Max\" Rockatansky is the only cop who seems up to par against the meanies. His Do-gooding (Or Good-doing......?) upsets one gang so mush, they murder Max's best friend, wife, and child. Well, wouldn't that just [tick] you off too? Of course, so Max is on a hunt for the murderers to enact revenge. This movie had a dirt-poor low-budget, little known actors, and few chances of a sequel. Well, the film was (at the time) the most financially successful australian film ever made, catapulted Mel Gibson into stardom (he later was known for his LETHAL WEAPON films), and produced not one, but 2 sequels, one of which (MAD MAX 2, known in the U.S. as THE ROAD WARRIOR) is even better than the first. The action scenes are fantastic, but one difference between this and your average action film is the character Max, and his futuristic environment. They engage you in a way that not only can you just indentify with the character and imagine yourself as the hero, he's so universal, you can imagine anyone in his shoes, doing exactly what he's doing. A very well made action film",

    "review/text": "The Road Warrior is one of the best action films ever made. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome explores post-apocalyptic societies better than any film ever has. Where does this leave Mad Max? What it remains is a flawed, but remarkable low-budget film. On a reported cost of $ George Miller has staged some truly impressive chases and stunts. Not a penny was wasted in this production. There are even some very tense moments, such as the scene where the gang tries to run over an injured Max as he desperately reaches for his gun.But the film still has its flaws and I can't just ignore them because of the low-budget or the cult classic status this movie has received. The problems range from some poor acting to scene transitions that are somewhat done in a disjointed manner. The only good performances seem to come from Mel Gibson and Joanne Samuel. Most others don't exactly get a lot of time to flesh out their characters.And then, there's the pace, which begins in lightning speed with its opening car chase, but slows down considerably quite a bit before regaining its action momentum in the finale. The Road Warrior began slowly, but it built itself up to a breakneck pace half-way through, rather than in the finale.So, Mad Max may not be a classic like its sequel, and it is the weakest of the series, but it's still very much worth watching for Gibson fans and those looking for some truly gritty and realistic action.",

Print damage still appears in places, but given the fact that the movie is twenty three years old, that's expected. But what blew me away is the sound of the 5.1 Aussie English Audio track(that's right, the original soundtrack). Unlike the local video release, the audio is as clear as a bell. Low sounding dialogue is understandable, clear and crisp. The dispatchers voice isn't muffled, and Brian May's musical composition plays more powerfully, while mixing effortlessly and complimenting the action sequences more effectively than ever.This movie has always been a classic of Aussie cinema, if not, cinema in general. It's a shame that it took twenty two years for you guys in the US to finally experience this the way it was originally intended. Better late than never, but given the treatment it's been given on this disc, well worth it!",

    "review/text": "\"Mad Max\" is a pretty simple revenge tale, a rousing sci-fi biker and car-crash-a-thon. Mel Gibson plays Max, a police pursuit driver in an unspecified future where roadgangs terrorize the innocent. Evidently road rage is way out of hand! When motorcycle thugs kill Max's best friend Goose (amiable Steve Bisley), his wife (Joanne Samuel) and son Sprog (!), Max gets mad... and gets even. What elevates this drive-in flick to cult classic status is director George Miller's use of low-riding, wide-angled shots to give the chase scenes an intensity never before seen. And Mel's presence, too, I suppose. Mel looks awful young, but flashes the charm and charisma that keeps him atop the box office charts all these years later.Like all cult movies, \"Mad Max\" has its cheesy moments. Max's scenes with his wife feature some goofy dialogue, and there's a very cheap-looking nightclub set at one point. But Hugh Keays-Byrne, as the reprehensible Toecutter, and Tim Burns (an Adam Ant lookalike) as the psychotic Johnny, provide ample menace. Plus, Miller and company throw in some very unusual-looking supporting players. And then there are the spectacular stunts and kinetic camerawork; they've been ripped-off a thousand times since!This \"Special Edition\" features a crisp, widescreen print (ooh!) and, even better, the original Australian vocal track (ahh!). Finally, someone wised up and banished the cartoon voices. The original actors perform solidly throughout, even subtly in places. At last, you can see why Samuel Z. Arkoff would bother to import this movie. But why'd he mangle it with bad overdubbing? No matter. The sequel (\"Road Warrior\") remains the superior film, but this new-to-the-U.S. version of the first movie provides some adrenaline-inducing adventure. Includes some nice commentary with plenty of inside trivia on the stuntwork and how they risked their lives just filming it! Truly death-defying work. As Max's boss Fifi says, \"We're gonna give 'em back their heroes!\"",

    "review/text": "I won't go into details about the movie. Fans of Mad Max already know the plight of Max Rockatansky and how he became the Road Warrior. Instead, I will go into how this DVD is better than the original released in the United States.First off, get this DVD. If all you have ever seen is the USA version with the awful dubbed American voices, then you have not seen the true Mad Max movie.Let me say something about dubbing: it normally doesn't come off well, especially when you redub English with English, as is the case with Mad Max. You lose ALL the emotions that the actors had originally portrayed in the movie. With Mad Max, this is entirely true. In fact, the actors that did the dubbed voices completely carried their emotions over the edge to the point of campiness. In no WAY did they portray the real emotions of the characters and it ruined the movie. It actually made excellent actors look bad and made the entire movie campy, which it isn't. It has it's moments of humor that actually fill in nicely with the Aussie voices, but is pushed over the edge in campiness with the American dubbing. It really is that bad, especially now that I've seen it with the Aussie voices.Once I saw this movie with the original Aussie voices, my opinion changed. I may be so bold as to say that this movie is possibly better than Mad Max 2 - The Road Warrior (and let's get that changed to Mad Max 2 now since everyone knows about Mad Max). What really upset me was that in the American version, they even ADDED dialogue that was SO unnecessary! I didn't realise this until I saw the Aussie version.This is not only a great action movie, but a wonderful drama as well. It has so many elements from different genres: action, suspense, horror, drama. George Miller put together an excellent movie on such a low budget.A lot of the elements were lost due to the dubbing but have now been brought back to life with this DVD release. One case is when Mel is talking to Jessie after Goose buys the farm. In the American dubbed version, Max doesn't seem that broken up about it. However, hearing Mel's voice, you can hear how Max is near tears, upset and sad that his best friend is dead. It really brings you closer to the characters to the point that you feel for them as real people. This was driven home to me even more during the scene when Jessie and Sprog are about to be mowed down by the Toecutter and his band of seedy thugs. When Jessie was running away, my mood turned to sadness, knowing what was about to happen. Once it happened, that sadness turned to extreme anger. When Max finally extracts his revenge, I was cheering. That NEVER happened with the American dubbed version.The DVD has two excellent documentories: one on how the movie was made and the other about Mel Gibson's rise to fame. There are also trailers, TV spots and posters available as well as the original American dubbed (mono) track, a commentary track, and a trivia track that pops up cool trivia bits while you watch the movie.At the price they have listed, this is a steal!...No true Mad Max fan would be without this movie. It was SO excellent that I watched it twice the day I bought it.Get it or else, it's time to send the MFP after you!",

The chases in this film are incredible (and the more surprising since this was made before the advent of CGI). The new DVD release has some rather interesting treats, such as the original Australian audio, as opposed to the dubbed version that floats around on television (the fact there doesn't seem to be a problem with understanding the dialogue in the original track makes me wonder why it hasn't been released like this in the U.S. for so long), plus you can pick between seeing the film in Widescreen or Pan&amp;Scan (widescreen...no contest on how I watch it), a documentary on the film's influence, and a commentary by members of the crew (who explain some of the more startling sequences in the movie).

It tries hard to be more than just a movie and it suceeds admirably. But now two problems with this honestly magnificent film (maybe minor problems---maybe!). One. The film looks it's made mostly for 15 year olds. I swear. It'a alot of action and emotion (too much at times) and some more story woulda really been nice in parts. Learning more about, say, Max and Jesse's marriage. Also, how civilization fell. Two. The story itelf is uneven. After the gangmember, The Knight Rider, is killed while Max (Gibson) is pursuing he (Max) is told the man's gang is out to get him. Ok. So when Max later meets up with all of them hoods it's because the gang is after him for killing the Knight Rider, right? Wrong! It's Max that is after them for incidentally (to the KnightRider's cause) killing Max's child and wife, both of whom the gang coincidentally met up with while the family of Max (and Max too) were faraway on a vacation! What happened to the gang's original plan to get Max for killing their leader? And talk about your chance meetings and it's a small world after all. These and other uneven bits (some concerning characters, like a hood called Johnny the boy) abound. Like I said story is uneven.",

For example: a conversation between Max and Goose - Goose - \"Hey Max, he looks.....\" indicating a man running away, ('he looks'..... like he is in trouble etc. etc.) The trivia track helpfully states that Goose is saying \"SEELOOKS\" i.e. Australian \"slang\" for a 'look see'. Being an Australian, and having never heard of this ANYWHERE, EVER, I wondered what fool made this up and INCLUDED it on the trivia track!!! Especially as the english subtitles show Goose as saying the correct line (as verified from original script) line \"Hey Max, he looks....\". Another example was the Trivia track nominates the location of Max's beach house as \"Fairhaven, West Australia\" WRONG, Its' Fairhaven , Victoria. (If you are not familiar with Australian geography - they didn't miss by much, just the OTHER SIDE of the continent. Similar to New York/California). On and on it goes. I found the trivia track foolish and stupid, and puts us Australians in a bad light. US buyers - buy the DVD, its the best yet!!!! (Just don't even bother with the trivia.)Mark, Melbourne.

I bought a VHS tape with Mel Gibson's original dialog, but the video quality was awful. This gives me the best of both. I strongly recommend the Special Edition DVD to any Mad Max fan.

    "review/text": "'Mad Max' is an advertisement for all would-be directors to just take up the 16mm device and damn well shoot. Although the present era is less friendly towards this move, just look at how a crock of dung like 'The Blair Witch Project' managed to make it to the cinema. This first installment in the Max trilogy finds a very young Gibson beginning with perfunctory zest, but soon becoming beset with rage at the loss of his friends and family. While the acting is above-board all right, the real stars of the show are the automotives themselves. With the Pursuit Interceptors running as thinly-veiled Datsun heaps, who could have thought that so much hps could have been squeezed out of every car in this picture? Extra kudos go to Toecutter's gang. If you look very carefully at the bit where Max, fresh out of the hospital where's he learnt that his wife is in critical and his son dead, charges the bikers on the overcross bridge, you will see that the biker with the red helmet gets his neck broken by the distended front wheel of his or a comrade's cycle! Ouch. I wonder if he died in real life. There's so much in here that is amateur pulling through as professional-looking, who knows how Miller was able to direct it. At any rate, the choreographer must have been ripping hairs. The movie itself is just the right length and the ending is bleak and suggestive for a sequel. The post-apocalyptic vein was handled in a novel way, showing how present-day elements could co-exist with the Beginnings of the End. All in all, to sum this up in three words: cars, violence and good plot. Did I say violence, already?",

Picture quality to me is awesome (just noticed the Nightrider has a small tattoo on one of his toes). Thats how much detail you'll see. I don't see any fan of the road warrior or mad max being disappointed by this. As mentioned in other reviews, the superior australian audio track is on by default which after seeing the special edition release from a few years back is the way to watch it. I watched a few times through with the sub-titles on just to catch some of their slang/colloquialism's. I really didn't notice any issues with color or noise in the movie. Everything was just very sharp on a 2009 1080P 27\" dell IPS PC monitor. I don't have hi-def audio running from my PC so I can't comment on the HD sound, otherwise everything was great. Per the product description the DVD is an actual seperate disc unlike HD-DVD releases that put the DVD on one side of the HD-DVD disc. So you basically get 2 copies albeit one that is SD.

    "review/text": "Mel Gibson was originally dubbed over, as mostly all the other actors where also, to create an \"English Language\" soundtrack version of Mad Max for its worldwide distribution. Thus pre-DVD the only way to hear Mel's original voice (the one he had when he turned up with bandages across his face with blood under the patches and the casting agents knew they had found Mad Max, an outback young lad with some good looks and a penchant for licking out of the bottle all day long) was to get the Australian version of the film on video tape. Now on \"Special Edition!! (Check to make sure this review is for that version as Amazon sometimes changes products and moves reviews!)\" DVD you can hear Mad Max the way it was meant to sound - 1 track Australian mono audio - but to be honest why brother with any 5:1 digital upgrade or a 2:1 English track?... unless you can't understand the original audio, in which case just turn to the subtitles.1979 Mad Max made its break onto the scene for one reason and one reason alone - the dawn of \"Ultraviolence\", Mad Max was instantly slapped with an X rating in Europe and was heavily criticised for being bloody graphic and too obscene for most viewers, George Miller had in fact delivered on very little blood on the screen, creating instead intensive bullying and quick flash cuts, probably dummies going under trucks or the jump cut subliminal frames of eyes jumping out of their sockets before a crash, people had never seen this kind of violence on the screen before, George Miller having himself already produced a violent twenty minute test film \"Violence in Cinema Pt 1\" (1971), knew there was a market for this thing, and there was, Mad Max produced several memorable posters for the first movie, each one either a cartoon or a still of anything other than Mad Max, the artwork always seemed to make people believe they where walking in on some sort of high budget Australian sci-fi violent action film, when in fact they where just viewing a bunch of guys with a 35mm camera, sticky tape and no fear of the brand new superbikes that could do 200 mph on the back roads of Oz. Peter Jackson obviously watched re-runs of this while making his Bad Taste. Low budget film makers know that Mad Max is probably just as important as Evil Dead that came out two years after it, in terms of how to make a low budget film that works. Just look at Mad Max, no one had two coins to rub together, yet they have a movie that spawned no less than two sequels and made an A-list Hollywood actor out of the lead, that is not bad going at all.The result is a very mish-mash of acting inabilities, poorly directed non-violent stuff, wonderful atmosphere, nice amateur camerawork, film speed ups to create the illusion of faster motion, that mostly actually work, but it is long and drawn out, taking well over an hour for Max Rockatanski to loose some loved ones, going after the \"Toecutter\" a biker and his crew for a bit of road rage and revenge, this is the first film in which children are murdered (all suggestive; like a ball and shoe rolling down the road) because of bad driving, people visibly go under trucks and some `burnings alive' but nothing that is graphic (the most graphic scene being a severed hand hanging from a chain) it was the illusion of manic bikers going psycho on the streets that was so easy for everybody at the end of the 1970s and start of the 1980s to believe, so naturally they bought into all the stuff because aristocratic systems had man blaming each other for their own problems and not bad management of government, the \"Halls of Justice\" scenes in which arrested druggie bikers who kill are set free because of a technicality, all of this to people was very real at the time, a real fear, then suddenly a victim hero emerges from the rubble to clean up the mess himself, Mad Max is a bit of a defining moment in the genre, generated a better sequel in terms of budget and action, but this original is still very much the more important offering because of what it is. The Original Ultraviolent Action Film that Played on people's Belief's Systems of What a Criminal Was. It was as good then as say making a film about Mid-Eastern terrorists going on a rampage across America &lt;--- take note all you budding young film makers.",

MGM has thankfully released Mad Max the way it was meant to be seen on DVD, with the original Australian language track restored in place of the dubbed American accents that were infamously incorporated into the film for years on home video and television.

After some further pondering, I realized that the reviewers were commenting on a different DVD release that came out prior to the Special Edition, as well as prior to this Decades Collection Edition.To put it plainly, this is a retouched version of the theatrical release as far as picture and sound quality. The sound is in very nice stereo, and the picture has been digitally restored and is in Wide Screen format. There are NO American voice overs added. There are a few extras on the DVD, including poster art, two documentaries, and a few trailers. All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase. It was extremely cheap for the quality. If you want a low-cost, good version of Mad Max and are not too interested in a bunch of DVD extras, this is a no brainer.P.S. Also included is a CD with some hit 70's songs on it, including some Marvin Gaye and Rod Stewart...so, if you haven't heard these heavily overplayed songs on the radio enough, you can own them on CD at no additional cost!",

It was a great hit and had two sequels follow it. Only difference about them was that they were during a post-apocalyptic period. But this one is the best one of all in the entire trilogy. It is a pretty normal movie with regular things happening most of the time. The action doesn't start until the end when Max Rockatanski seeks revenge on a nomad biker gang for the murder of his wife and infant son. Max starts out as a kind loving man. But once everything in his life falls apart and he loses the people who are most important to him, he no longer sees the need to care for the lives of others. The evil bikers led by the Toecutter all suffer painful and terrible deaths for what they had done to Max's family. He starts out as a regular man with a job who has a family and a best friend. But sometime in the movie, Jim Goose, his best friend, is murdered as well. Then Max decides to quit his job due to that one event. He just happens to lose everything he had. All you see of him in the end is Max driving a Canyonero and armed with a shotgun while wearing his police uniform. A courageous hero doing what he can to rid the scum of the area. This is the best movie to watch out of all three.",

The bad guys are a malicious motorcycle gang led by a crazed and psychopathic goon named Toecutter. After one of Toecutter's cronies is killed by Max, Toecutter is looking for some serious payback, but he's messing with the wrong cop...you don't wanna get Max mad.The production design coveys a world that's gone to hell and captures the grim atmosphere perfectly. Brian May's (not the guitarist from Queen) exciting music score gives the film a larger than life quality. Director George Miller makes the most of his small budget. The chase sequences and editing is terrific.This DVD edition is taken from the original video release.",

A worldwide hit upon its initial release, director George Miller's \"Mad Max\" had the misfortune of receiving U.S. distribution from American-International Pictures (AIP), which trimmed five minutes and redubbed the film with American voices - thus eliminating its Australian flavor. Adding insult to injury, AIP buried the movie in drive-ins and grindhouses as a second feature. Happily, the original 95-minute version can be found on this DVD release. Fueled by Mel Gibson's effective performance as a vengeful highway cop and David Eggby's stunning photography, the futuristic \"Mad Max\" boasts some extraordinary stunt work and offbeat characterizations. Miller gains tremendous mileage from his limited budget and the Australian locations provide an ideal visual counterpart to the desolate cops-vs.-bikers atmosphere. Not surprisingly, this independent cult classic helped put Australia on the cinematic map.",

    "review/text": "In spite of the fact that the 1981 film The Road Warrior--the second influential cinematic work of writer/director George Miller's Dystopian vision of the near future trilogy--leads to receive the anti-hero Max, released two years earlier, is where it all started... For it was here that Miller first brought to the screen his hellish vision, where civil society is under siege by crime and disorder, with the strength and charisma of a new young, tough, good looking actor by the name of Mel Gibson...Gibson was just 23 years old when he took the role of Max Rockatansky--a young hotshot cop so emotionally wounded--and was such an unknown star that when the film was hitting the screens in the States, the preview trailers didn't even mentioned him but instead focused on the movie's coolest and most original car action ever filmed... In retrospect, of course, Gibson's portrayal of a relentless vigilante is an essential element of the picture...In the Australian outback, Rockatansky is a motorcycle cop trying to keep order in a quickly disintegrating society... Vicious lawless bikers and road-raging psychopaths race up and down the forbidden territories, raping and pillaging the peaceful towns, and one such bunch ends up at the door of Max's wife (Joanne Samuel), and their 2-year old son... When they are both lying dead in middle of the road, Max is all driven over the edge, and so starts a high-speed pursuit involving wild rides, chilling fights, and memorable fast-motion suspenseful scenes rarely equaled in cinema...",

    "review/text": "... and I don't just mean the Mad Max saga but the Mel Gibson story. I'd heard this movie got Mel Gibson noticed among the big players - seeing it today made me believe it.The movie begins with a car chase, with some really gutsy destruction sequences, somewhere amongst which, Gibson makes his entry as an \"Interceptor\", a cop from the near future - where this story is based - trying to make order in this \"Anarchie\" (no kidding! that's the name of the Ln mentioned in the first few shots of the film!). The government is pretty much non-existent in this futuristic flick, and gangs of roadies have taken up terrorizing and literally ruling the outlands.Max, along with his partner - Office Jim Goose, takes his work seriously, and intends to clean the scrounge of the town, before his partner becomes a casualty of the war. Max suddeny is afraid for his family, and realizes he's not ready to take this war to its bitter end, and decides to take a break from his cop-career.What follows is an eerie rendition, out on the Australian outback, of the origins of the character of Mad Max, before it got the adjective Mad; with some really slick editing and heart-pumping action. The chase sequences are simply great and the lack of dialogues makes it that much more watchable. Not much to speak - if you're into killing amd ambushing for a living.This movie is the first of the trilogy of Mad Max, and is a good one at that. You get to see where Gibson learnt the conviction and grittyness that has since marked so many of his roles, notably Lethal Weapon, Conspiracy Theory, and The Patriot.Must see - for Gibson and Mad Max fans!",

    "review/text": "This is an interesting film, which if occasionally a bit wooden, virtually created its own genre overnight, and made Mel Gibson a star.Perhaps its most noteable feature was George Miller's use of unusual camera angles, which created one or two iconic images. Sometimes it has the feeling of an exploitation film, but it never develops in that way and by today's standards it seems rather tame.It looks as though it was made on a pretty low budget, and I prefer the brasher sequels where a little more polish was added. It remains a film curiosity, but really not much more than that.",

    "review/summary": "Awesome Post-Apocalyptic Setting!",
    "review/text": "At this point Mad Max is simply a post apocalyptic classic film. While some people may not enjoy the movie through and through, I don't think that statement is very much contested. Don't get me wrong, it's a fairly old film from today's perspective and its filming style shows that. I think in perspective this movie was pretty on point for what people were thinking about at that time. I mean when you think about it, the Cold War was still going strong and each country was trying to out power the other in terms of military might. So the greatest concern at that time was a nuclear war and \"Mad Max's\" setting takes place shortly after such a catastrophic event.It's pretty interesting to watch because it gives a pretty interesting \"what if\" scenario if technology and development stopped in the late 1970's. So you never had the internet boom and the age of the computer in the 90's. It's kind of cool when you try to picture this scenario. The places it's most apparently are in the hospital and the kinds of cars they are using. Despite this downfall it seems like everyone has custom vehicles and most are designed with a sports car in mind. In the hospital scenes it reminds me of the film version of \"Johnny Got His Gun\" because the hospital areas just seemed too archaic by today's standards.In Mad Max the world is still trying to hold on to the small vestiges of society that it can. Lawlessness is at a whole new level and it seems that the court systems run amok similar to our current ones. Basically the main premise for the film is that Mel Gibson plays a cop named Max who is effectively terrorized by a biker gang indirectly at first, but then very directly as the movie moves on. The gang has this bizarre spiritually violent ethos, where the main member Nightrider was a key messenger of this philosophy... or at least that's how I'm interpreting his role. The police sort of have a hand in this man's death so another member of the gang, Toecutter, comes after them. Nightrider's death is what sparks the turmoil and brings the gang into town to wreak their havoc.It's really kind of a tragic tale when you think of it as a whole, but that's kind of the point. Max is a tragic character that gets pushed to the absolute extreme on every end. However, I think during this film they didn't truly know what direction they wanted to bring Mel's character and I feel that direction was finally found in \"The Road Warrior.\" However, \"Mad Max\" is still fairly essential in order to get into Max's background and why he is so angry. There is a slight discontinuity between the two films though, because at the end of this one he still has contact with some semblance of civilization and in \"Road Warrior\" it's all wastelands.While \"Mad Max\" can seem a bit dry at times because it's mostly cars racing around on highways, it does set the stage for a very influential film (I feel at least) in the future. While authors were setting the stage for post apocalyptic worlds, \"Mad Max\" set the stage for a lawless and harsh reality, unlike \"1984\" where the war pushed society to much stricter controls. I think this is the type of movie people should at least see once, at the very least for nostalgic purposes, because it does not have nearly the same re-watch value as the sequel.",

    "review/text": "Mel Gibson is so young looking in this film, and so handsome! Wow this film is so full of action and even on a low budget you can't beat Mad Max!WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!The film is about Austraila in the outback perhaps. It's in the Post-Nuclear future, a town is being threatened by a ruthless bicker gang lead by the infamous Toecutter. It's up to what's left of the police to stop them!Our hero Max Rockatansky (Played brilliently by Mel Gibson), pursues the Nightrider, a member of Toecutter's gang, on a high speed chase. When Nightcutter dies, the outraged Toecutter plans his revenge on Max and the entire police elite. He starts off by picking off Jim Goose, a fellow officer and friend of Max's. Johnny, a young lacky of Toecutter's, sets a trap for Jim. Jim gets very wounded when they set him on fire. Max visits Jim in the hospital and is angered and horrified at what the evil biker gang has done to his friend. Max then does the wrong thing by resigning from the force and decides to spend some time with his wife and young son where the bikers are nowhere to be found.But no, that doesn't stop Toecutter from wanting revenge, it wasn't enough to burn Jim, he had to pick on Max too! But this time he does something almost worst then the last time. This time these victims were innocent. He runs down Max's wife and infent son, and kills his son while his wife suffers massive injuries to her internal organs and has to have both of her legs and arms amputated. God hasn't Max suffered enough already?!Now Max is clearly pissed off and gets out his police uniform and starts his vengence spree.SPOILERS END HEREThis is a very good low budget movie. I love the hair styles, enough though it was made in the late 70s, the hairstyles looked 80s. Cool. If you want to see a very young Mel Gibson, then buy this movie or rent it! Mad Max is so awsome!",

Most reviewers and the documentaries included on the DVD rave about Mel Gibson's performance, and they're right!But among the things that makes this movie so much better than its budget would seem to allow were the truly fine performances of most of the other actors. We're not talking Oscar caliber, of course, but strong enough to be believable and keep the viewer caught up in the story. Whether due to great direction or real actor talent (and probably both), these \"little things\" really set the stage for Gibson's character to play out against.This was the first time I've heard the original Australian language version of the film, and was pleased. The other extras were very good as well, making this an outstanding value for the price!So after you've watched the movie several times and have gotten past Gibson's shining performance, watch for all those other glimmers that are minor stars in their own right.",

I also thought that it was going to be more of a musical, but there was very little singing, so I was disappointed in that. I also didn't like the moral behind the plot, of the wish itself--getting the little girls dad the role in the play--by using any means to sabbotage the character who had the role. I don't think that's a good message for kids, even if the methods used are done by fairy godmothers. I know a lot of shows do that, like Bruce Almighty, but in even that show, in the end he gave the newscaster's job back to the character that he stole it from.

    "review/text": "This movie was out about a year before my parents finally bought it for me. I simply wanted it because I thought the cover was cool. But when I watched it, I loved it, and I made all my friends watch it when they came over.The story is about Annabel, played by Mara Wilson, the girl from &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; and &quot;Matilda.&quot; While she is reading a version of &quot;Cinderella&quot; one night, she wishes that she could have a fairy godmother. And she gets one. Except her fairy godmother isn't what she had in mind, because she is actually a man named Murray, played by the hilarious Martin Short.Murray promises to grant Annabel one wish, and she selflessly decides that she wants her father, a widower, to land the main role in a musical play. But it isn't that 'simple.'For one thing, Murray has never been a fairy godmother before, and he has a mentionable amount of difficulty with his magic wand. For instance, he accidently takes Annabel to Nebraska and changes a rough-looking man into a gigantic rabbi.The second thing standing in the way of a granted wish is Claudia, the fairy-godmother-turned-evil-witch played by Kathleen Turner. The witch and her hilarious sidekick are bent on destoying the existence of any other magic than Claudia's to ensure that nothing stands in her way when she decides to carry out some rather evil plans.The movie is extremely funny, and has lots of great special effects. It is almost impossible to smile as you watch Murray screw up on everything he attempts to do and Annabel bicker with her older brother and her reactions to Murray's awfully-cast spells. So great is the presence of comedy, wittiness, and evil in Kathleen Turner's character that you look forward to the scenes she's in. And so you end up laughing through the movie, marveling at the spell-casting scenes, and silently cheering as the movie proves yet again that good conquers evil. AND throw in an interesting cameo from Terri Garr, one of the supporting actresses in &quot;Tootsie,&quot; and you have every bit of a five-star fantasy that's perfect for the whole family.",

But each time Anabelle makes a wish, Maury makes a mess. All hope seems lost as their father turns into a statue and the spell must be broken at the stroke of midnight or else their father will remain a statue forever.

Robert Pastorelli (the crazed painter from Murphy Brown) plays a rather lackluster role. Kathleen Turner pulled off the typical \"Evil Witch\" role a little too well. Mara Wilson seemed to do a better job in \"Matilda,\" but she was good in this film nontheless.I happened to get the Italian version of this film (alternately titled \"Un Semplice Desiderio\") and I will add that watching this movie with Italian audio on adds a little to it.

The great bulk of screen time is spent on talking head interviews. That in itself would be okay, but they focus more on praising Jimi than discussing the music and the nuts and bolts of its creation. There is a lot of material that didn't make it onto this DVD - extensive alternate takes and outtakes - that has been broadcast on the radio. That material would have provided a fascinating supplement and insight into the Electric Ladyland creation process, and the brilliance behind the compositions of the songs. But instead this disc shows too much reminiscing about Jimi and mourning of his early death.Once again, Eddie Kramer provides the meat of the subject matter, playing the mixer like a virtuoso. But even here his comments seem curiously attenuated. Electric Ladyland is a masterwork of studio recording, one of the striking achievements of 20th century rock music, and a complete treatment could fill several DVDs. Here we only get snippets. The same is true of the performances; this disc only shows brief clips, frequently interrupted, of various classic performances.This is a disc for completists, and you probably won't want to watch it more than once. It talks about Jimi a lot, but there just isn't much of him here.",

It pointed out that they would be on one coast one night and the other coast the next night. At the same time Hendrix would try to make time to record while trying to put together his own recording studio in New York City.It shows how Hendrix would for instance make recordings of guitar music at one speed and play it back at another for special effects.It tells you how he used a comb with wax paper to simulate a kazoo sound for another track.It interviews Michael Finnigan, who played on Rainy day, dream away.Finnigan talks about how Hendrix instructed him to play the music they way he wanted it.It indicates that Hendrix played a harpsichord on Burning of the Midnight Lamp. Hendrix was apparentley a good keyboard player.Hendrix also uses Jack Casady to play bass guitar on some songs, and plays bass himself in Noel Reddings abscence.This is in my mind a very good documentary.....I would recommend it to any Hendrix fan or any serious fan of the Rock of the 60's.",

    "review/text": "During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Italian movie industry made a number of World War II films. They ranged from trash to average to occasionally excellent. THE FIFTH DAY OF PEACE represents the best of the genre. Chances are you wouldn't be looking at the DVD if you didn't already know what the film was about.The DVD quality is appalling. The print is muddy and smeary, mastered from a video tape. You know how when a VCR may start to eat a tape, it leaves those crinkles on the actual tape and you get the telltale \"skips\" on the TV screen when you watch the damaged part of the tape? Well, those same type skips show up during part of the credits. The colors look worn out as well. The sound is monophonic and a little muffled. There is a brief yet loud and annoying buzz about 40 minutes into the film as well. The sound is not always in synchronization with the picture, either. It's not because of the dubbing, though. I have compared with my video copy. There are plenty of digital artifacts off and on as well. The screen-shots for the 10 chapter scenes and those of Johnson and Nero look excellent, but do not compare well to the picture quality of the actual film.The DVD is 1.33:1, cropped from the original letterbox print of 2.35:1. Portions of words are missing from both the sides of the screen and the bottom of the screen during parts of the credits.It looks as though the folks at Simitar might have just recorded this from a TV screen with a video camera. An enterprising way to save money but also a great way to lose business.For \"special\" features there are 10 chapter searches, movie factoids which provide no information not found on the case, and abridged biographies and filmographies for Richard Johnson and Franco Nero.I piad [a small amount] for this and still thought it was a waste. My video from Congress Entertainment, while still lower quality, is better than this DVD.",

No attempt here to glamorise war. Everything is very bleak, but the film is a superb character study and all the performances are excellent. Best ever performance by Richard Johnson. Only major criticism is of the unconvincing Canadian accents.The movie was never released in the UK (and maybe not in the USA either).

    "review/text": "This is the second video tape in \"St. Elsewhere: The Collector's Edition,\" but for some reason it does not offer up consecutive episodes from the celebrated television medical drama. You have the third and fifth episodes, but skips one of the best of the early episodes, \"Cora and Arnie.\" Do not worry, that is available on the next volume in the series. So while neither of these two early first season episodes is great they are still solid offerings showing the hectic lives of the beleaguered doctors of Boston's St. Eligius and making it clear why this show was described as \"Hill Street Blues\" in a hospital, which is neither an inaccurate or a demeaning description for the series. Now if we can just get this series out on DVD as well (hint, hint, hint):Episode 3, \"Down's Syndrome\" (Written by Tom Fontana, Story by Joshua Brand, John Falsey, & Fontana, First aired November 16, 1982), has a major plot line dealing with Dr. Annie Cavanero (Cynthia Sikes) counseling a young woman, Denise Whitehill (Maureen Anderman), who is expecting a Down's syndrome child. The story of the bomber continues, with Dr. Hugh Beale (G.W. Bailey) visiting Andrew Reinhardt (Tim Robbins) and finding no evidence of remorse. Talking to the bomber's parents do not help much either. Meanwhile, Peter White (Terence Knox) almost kills somebody in the E.R., Kathy Martin (Barbara Whinnery) and Wayne Fiscus (Howie Mandel) end up in a stalled elevator together, and Jack Morrison (David Morse) gets some good news from his wife. However, my favorite plotline in this one has Dr. Auschlander (Norman Lloyd) is using slides of his own liver biopsy to teach some lessons. This was the point where the character moved from being a minor supporting character to something bigger on \"St. Elsewhere.\" The Down Syndrome plotline comes on a bit strong (Fontana received a pointed letter about the portrayal of Down Syndrome children from George Will), but as always there are enough story lines here so that you can pick and choose.Episode 5, \"Samuels and the Kid\" (Written by John Masius, Story by Joshua Brand, John Falsey, and Masius, First aired November 30, 1982), is primarily about Dr. Samuels (David Birney) and Robbie Durant (Jeremy Licht), a young boy who comes in for leg surgery. Of course Dr. Mark Craig (William Daniels) getting his \"Surgeon of the Year\" award makes the most noise and does not bring as much pleasure to the recipiant as you would think. On the hospital romance front Fiscus surprised Martin with a romantic gesture that is not well received. The other opportunity for fireworks is when young Dr. Chandler (Denzel Washington) challenges the competency of a veteran nurse (Roxanne Reese). Getting away from the hospital provides no relief, as Dr. Caverno discovers when her weekend is ruined by a patient (Ally Sheedy) trying to deliver her baby at home with only the help of a teenage boy.",

The Brown Album has always surfaced as one of the top 10 favorites of many other music artists. Watching Garth Hudson at the keyboard; or Levon Helm explain his drum technique; or sitting at the recording console and listening to the harmonies with producer John Simon, is a look inside of a group that changed the sound of North American music in the late 60's to mid 70's.

    "review/text": "This DVD has tracks from both The Bands first two albums. So you get some analysis of the first album (Big Pink) as well as the famous brown album. The reason being that they were all recorded at the same sessions.Its a fabulous documentary, with great interviews and analysis at the mixing desk, perhaps most memorably Levon who still gets carried away with the music.Little known gems like Whispering Pines are given added poignancy when Richard Manuels suicide is mentioned late on in the film. Sadly Rick Danko died a few years after this film was made. When you think that Richard Manuel, Rick Danko and Levon Helm all variously sang lead vocals, depending on the song, you begin to realise how unique this group was in its original line-up.Garth Hudson improvises at the keyboard for the camera a number of times demonstrating one of his many talents. We also see him playing Soprano Sax with John Simon - getting that classic Band horn sound.Although not discussed in the film, it is documented that Levon has a problem with Robbie, so Robbie gets little credit (if any) from Levon. I don't think the reverse is true, but the truth in these matters is always difficult to establish.There is some great early 70's footage of the group playing at the pink house, plus the inevitable clips from The Last Waltz.Various musicians, including Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Don Was extoll the virtues of the group and there are some interesting points made by Greil Marcus. Sometimes Marcus can be a little pretentious, but most of the time here he doesn't go to far overboard.This is one of the best Classic Albums DVD's and I would strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn more about one THE most important Rock 'n' Roll groups to come out of North America (four of them were Canadian).Note this is a documentary, so most of the time the tracks are interrupted by people talking. If you want a concert DVD by The Last Waltz....",

    "review/text": "I'm a big fan of the \"Classic Albums\" series, which takes the viewer inside the process that resulted in some of our best rock albums. I'd seen \"Who's Next,\" \"Songs in the Key of Life,\" and \"Graceland\" before watching \"The Band,\" and had thoroughly enjoyed all of them. So my hopes were pretty high for this one and I wasn't disappointed.It helps, of course, that the album itself was so good -- easily my favorite release by the group -- but the DVD helps to break down how they created tunes like \"King Harvest (Has Surely Come)\" \"Up on Cripple Creek,\" \"Jemima Surrender\" and so on through interviews with the band members and others involved, often as they sit at the recording console playing back particular pieces of music.Much of the commentary comes from Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm -- thankfully before their famous falling out, but we also get some words from the late, lamented Rick Danko, looking a little the worse for wear.Just an example of an insightful moment: Robertson is talking about the creative keyboard work of Garth Hudson, using \"Up on Cripple Creek\" to illustrate. When he comes to the chorus (\"up on Cripple Creek she sends me, when I spring a leak she mends me\"), Robertson plays back Hudson's part, which sounds like a merry-go-round calliope, by itself. But when Robertson blends in the rest of the tracks, Hudson's part becomes the perfectly meshed contribution it is. Robertson chuckles in admiration as he listens to Hudson's playing. It's a great moment.If you are interested in getting a good look at how great music is made, \"Classic Albums\" is a series to look into, and if you haven't bought one of the DVDs yet, \"The Band\" is a good place to start, particularly if you are a fan of the group.",

    "review/text": "The Band is awesome. No doubt about it, but that's just it. They were a BAND. Robbie Robertson (spelling correct) somehow fooled the other Band members into letting him have songwriting credit (and Robertson got them to particiapte, against their better wishes, in \"The Last Waltz\" concert and accompanying film). Take a look at Band drummer Levon Helm's book, \"This Wheel's on Fire,\" and he explains that Robertson and someone in the Band's management talked the group into giving Robertson sole (or majority) songwriting credit, so they all could supposedly benefit financially. Robertson got rich, while the others didn't. It's a shame, since Helm, keyboardist Richard Manuel (RIP) and bassist Rick Danko (RIP) all had better voices than Robbie's.There's also a great photo in Helm's book that has Helm showing Robertson how to play something on Robertson's Stratocaster. Great picture. It shows that it was a group effort, but Robertson and \"The Last Waltz\" film erronneously claim Robertson as the leader and chief talent. \"The Last Waltz\" concert was filmed by Martin Scorsese, Robbie's buddy. If Robertson truly was the lone genius of The Band, don't you think his solo work would have been much better?Also, in the words of the Arkansas-born Levon Helm himself, \"Do you really think a guy from Canada (Robertson) wrote 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down' all by himself?'\"",

    "review/text": "With the recent remastering and re-releasing of the full Band canon, interest in one of America's greatest musical acts has never been higher. This is as good a time as any to pick up a copy of &quot;The Band,&quot; one in Rhino records series called &quot;classic Albums,&quot; which documents the making of classic albums. (other dvd's include the Wailers, the Who, and the Grateful Dead) This dvd documents the classic lp &quot;The Band&quot; from 1969.Filled with vintage footage of the Band in rehersals, as well as interviews with Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, the reclusive Garth Hudson, and the late Rick Danko, &quot;The Band&quot; chronicles the making of this amazing album, focusing on the disparate musical influences- country, bluegrass, rockabilly, black R&amp;B, rock n roll, and folk/Americana- that led to many of guitarist/vocalist Robbie Robertson's greatest songs.The surviving members at the time of this documentary (made in 1997-pianist Richard Manuel had died in 1986) add their own anecdotes to the music, giving the songs unique colors and life. Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson, and Garth Hudson (the most pleasant surprise on the dvd taking into account his well known reclusive nature) add to the fun by playing some of the tunes based on their perspective, offering running commontary as they go. Add to the Band's perspective those of Eric Clapton, (who wanted to join the Band at one point) George Harrison, Elton John's lyicist Bernie Taupin, and producer Don Was, and the cup of greatness runneth over.The performances, including &quot;The Weight,&quot; &quot;Rockin' Chair,&quot; &quot;I Shall Be Released,&quot; &quot;The Unfaithful Servant,&quot; and &quot;King Harvest (Has Surely Come),&quot; as well as a touching tribute to the late Richard Manuel, make the dvd all the more valuable to fans of the Band. The music is timeless, the interviews vintage, and the performances sparkle as they never have. That makes this dvd one to have in any collection.R.I.P. Richard Manuel and Rick Danko",

The surviving members of the group actually participated in this documentary, and they show a lot of pride and a lot of affection for their days together, and for the music they made.Just watch Levon listening back to &quot;Rocking Chair,&quot; his eyes closed, delighted at the sound of Richard Manuel's voice, basking in the joy of what The Band created together so many years ago. He still retains that modest, down-home quality that is so endearing.Then there's &quot;Brother Garth.&quot; Band fans will find this DVD worth the purchase price just to see Garth improvising at the keyboard, displaying just what a lovable crazed-genius he really is.And then there is plenty of Robbie Robertson, giving some very insightful information about The Band's writing and recording processes. Like Levon, Robbie just can't contain the thrill he obviously feels listening back to the original multitracks from the album.Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that Robbie ever &quot;reunited&quot; with the others for this program, even if just to listen to the tracks together. The interviews are all done separately. But that's not really a complaint, just an observation.Anyone who is a fan of The Band, and anyone who has a genuine interest in the creative process and in making music, will certainly love this DVD. I'm a picky guy, but I gave this the highest rating I could.",

It is rare to see anything about The Band that includes input from both Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm and the DVD is all the better for it. I found that the fine editing kept Levon's bitterness to a minimum (the &quot;someone needs to tune that guitar&quot; quip from Rocking Chair) and Robbie's contribution to the whole affair balanced. The highlights include the improvisation of Garth Hudson at the keyboard and the insights of John Simon, who produced the first two Band albums and Jon Taplin. Levon sums it up well in the end.

    "review/text": "If you're not a lifelong, hard shell Band addict, go to the next review. Only these people will probably appreciate the rest of this review. The following are my personal highlights.It has several different sections of footage of Garth. Intertwining classical, gospel, circus midway, blues, and folk licks, his nose approximately two inches from the keyboard, occasionally talking to the keyboards as he plays---The man is beyond genius status. He's also very cool.Watch and listen to Rick play \"When You Awake\" on flattop.Watch the unabashed joy in Levon's face when he is at the mixing board listening to Richard and Rick (and himself) harmonize on \"Rockin' Chair\", or to Garth's keyboards on \"Rag Mama Rag\". (\"Ain't it easy when you know how\"--Levon on Garth's playing).Watch Robbie Robertson sing proudly into a purposely dead mike. You might fool some of the people some of the time...Watch Robbie take credit for the writing when it was obviously a group effort almost every time.Richard wrote the lyrics to several songs; Garth and Rick wrote a lot of the music--very seldom did they receive credit (or royalties)--only Robbie.Listen to Eric Clapton and George Harrison reveal that the Band's music was beyond anything they had heard or played.Listen to Robbie's chord work and his excellent explanation as to why the Band sang harmonies a certain way (that was all they could reach)and why he frequently played odd, partial guitar chords (they just sounded right).Just watch and listen to Levon.Whether he's singing, playing, or being interviewed, he is extremely entertaining. He, like Garth, is also one of a kind.Listen to Richard sing anything. I'm positive he and Rick are members in good standing in God's choir.This is a wonderful DVD. It has much more footage than the TV version I taped off of television. I bought it new.., although I think it ususally sells for [more]. I would have paid [more] for it. If you're a Band fanatic-this is a must have.",

Composed primarily of interviews with individual members of the group and producer John Simon in studio settings discussing the music on their timelessly classic second studio recording \"The Band\".This one is for music lovers. Many of the interviews take place at a mixing console in a studio, with John Simon, Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm adjusting track levels to bring up and highlight the various components of the mix. Absolutely fascinating stuff. Having listened to this music hundreds of times over the past 30 years, it was revelatory to hear some of the more creative parts of this complex whole isolated, with insightful commentary from the artists who created it.Also fascinating, in more of a train wreck kind of a way, was seeing the interview and solo studio performance asides of Garth Hudson and Rick Danko. Both brilliant artists, but both seemingly still paying the price of the lifestyle that accompanied the height of The Band's fame. Rick's remarks on the loss of his best friend Richard Manuel left me with chills, knowing that not too many more months from this interview and Rick would be gone from this place as well.Well worth the bargain price, this will be one of those rare DVD's that I actually return to again and again.",

The one on the making of Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was a real treat, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it is just them saying over and over again that it was difficult being trapped in a small studio together, while they were breaking up. The only thing I did not already know, that I got from this video, is that Mick Fleetwood seems like a pretty nice guy, but the other three are self-absorbed jerks. Listen to the album again and again, but I recommend not wasting your time on this pointless and thoroughly uninteresting video.",

They tell how they wrote the songs, recorded them and you get to hear how the harmonies came together so perfectly. The producers also explain how they worked their magic. Not too many people heard of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; before &quot;The Dance&quot; came out, but I knew of it and I heard of how the band tore out Stevie's heart by not including it on the album.

It's important to remember that no filming occurred in the Record Plant (their recording studio) during the sessions. The film footage that did exist was all post production concert footage; sound quality that is poor by present video based audio standards.With that said, those interested in learning how one of the most emotionally charged albums in Rocks history was created will find the DVD very gratifying.

    "review/text": "I agree with other reviewers that suggest 'Rumours'is among the 10 best albums ever made. I bought the album when it was first released on vinyl around 25 years ago and it's since been one of the 3 of my most favourite albums. One thing that struck me when I first listened to the album apart from the musical experience was just how well produced the album was. I think the attention to sound quality made it an even more rewarding listening experience. This DVD / DVD-A version was sonically a little dissppointing for me to be honest. Yes it does sound clean and detailed but the dynamic nuances have been compressed in much the same way you here on FM radio, and possibly even more so. Listening to dynamic tracks such as 'The Chain' or 'Gold Dust Woman', the compession, especially in the bass is almost laughable and a real let down compared with the normal cd release. I'm not sure why it was remastered in this way, especially since the DVDA medium supposedly allows for improved dynamic resolution. There is no doubt in my mind that the original vinyl lp version of this album offered the best sound quality and ultmately the most rewarding experience musically. I was hoping that this DVDA release could recapture that but sadly not. If only these DVDA releases could be transfered directly from the original analogue master tapes without be stuffed around with. Now that would be great but it seems I'm alone in the world in thinking that.",

We've all heard the story about the relationships, Stevie and Lindsey, Christine and John, Stevie and Mick, the drugs, etc. but this release goes into what it's all about; the music. It's really great to hear parts of the song such as the background vocals in You Make Loving Fun or the music as in Oh Daddy.This definitely brought a new perspective on the Rumours album for myself, a die-hard Fleetwood Mac fan.",

It's easy to see why the Rumours album is considered a classic. Every song on the album is great. The video gets into the creative process behind some of the songwriting and the inspiration for some of their ideas.During the recording of the album there were two couples in the band basically going through the process of breaking up. So there was a lot of tension behind the scenes, as they were putting the album together. When you hear the final product, though, you would never know it. At least they were still able to maintain a certain level of professionalism as musicians and a band.I have not yet purchased one from the series I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. I am a musician myself and I compose and record my own music. I love getting the inside scoop on how these albums are made and the behind the scenes look at the processes of songwriting and recording. These videos often get into the impact many of these albums have on popular music and how some have influenced musicians who have come after them. Great series. I want to buy them all.",

The Audio DVD is a completely different experience than the item you are looking at. This item is a regular \"movie\" visual-type DVD that includes interviews with the band and that breaks down the music peice by peice. It's been on TV before...and, it's been available on VHS for quite a long time. With that said...Being a huge FM and Stevie fan, I purchased this on DVD hoping that it might have additional footage or features that were not on the VHS (which, of course I have already). Well sadly, there is nothing additional on the DVD. However, this is still such a GREAT thing to have. It's absolutely amazing to listen to Stevie, alone at her candlelit piano, singing \"Dreams\". It makes me cry because it's so beautiful. That 30 seconds of video ALONE is worth the purchase price. It's incredible to hear the music \"taken apart\" at the soundboard, instrument by instrument, sound by sound, voice by voice. It really helps you understand and appreciate the painstaking process this was for all of them. If you've never seen it, you really should buy it - on either format - DVD or VHS - it really makes no difference.",

It's still quite interesting to hear Fleetwood Mac tell the stories themselves of how the songs that made up their landmark album came together. Why \"Rhiannon\" is included here is beyond me, it wasn't even on that album. The song was released when Buckingham and Nicks joint the group one album prior, so there's some significance. It was Christine that came up with the chunky riff that dominates \"You Make Loving Fun\", but together with Lindsey they made a masterpiece. Between a classic live performance of the song, John and Christine discuss their troubled relationship during the recording. Stevie Nicks reveals that she wrote \"Dreams\" in Sly Stones bed, and how Lindsey always had a way to make her songs sound great, when he was happy with her. The Scottish/Irish folk influenced \"Second Hand News\" was a Buckingham contribution. He reveals that he was listening to the Bee Gee's \"Jive Talking\" at the time he wrote it. Mick Fleetwood offers an interesting little tidbit here; he wasn't the odd man out when it came to dysfunctional relationship. Not only were Lindsey and Stevie & John and Christine on the skid, he was dealing with his best friend sleeping with his wife. They're still friends today though.Mick breaks down the little pieces that make up \"Go Your Own Way\" in the studio to show how it all comes together. Lindsey demonstrates on an acoustic guitar how important the background riff to the song was. Some great stories come out of the discussion of \"Never Going Back Again\". Stevie and Christine always had each other to turn to, John emphasizes how drug use was common place back then, but realizes how bad they were, and the producers tell a hilarious story of mishandled drugs. You've gotta love Lindsey's afro in the video for \"Don't Stop\". The band goes into how the song is connected to President Clinton. The producer states that he felt \"Songbird\" sounded like a concert hall type song, so they booked a concert hall to record it. They set up a piano with flowers and champagne for Christine to play away. They include performance footage in which I can't tell if it's Christine back then or Christine today. She really hasn't aged a bit. The DVD covers the song \"Silver Springs\" which didn't actually appear on the album. The producers said they had to cut it due to time space. There's a live performance of \"The Chain\" from the eighties, circa Lindsey's funny hat days. The group reveals that the song was changed at the last minute to make it work.The BadThe group does their interviews separate from each other.The VerdictThe stories are just as compelling as the album.",

For those of us out there who have been listening to this album since 1977, you will be astounded by the harmonies, the instrumentals, and vocals that have never been heard before, even on the highest quality CD.For the general music fan, Fleetwood Mac fan or not, this DVD is pure musical craftsmanship! The sound quality, vocals, etc. are top notch and can be enjoyed by anyone with a love and/or knowledge of music that stands the test of time. The music on Rumours is not dated in any way. The theme of love lost, covered in Dreams, Go Your Own Way, and Silver Springs, to name a few, along side the theme of love found, covered by You Make Loving Fun, Don't Stop, and Songbird are as timely today as they were in 1977. In other words, something for everyone, and a cut above the rest.",

Oh and by the way... your former love would be writing publicly about the whole experience! That's pretty much the dilemma the members of the music group, Fleetwood Mac experienced, while making one of the biggest selling rock albums to come out of the 1970s. The history of this album's creation is explored in this episode of Rhino's Classic Albums series documentary, &quot;Fleetwood Mac Rumors&quot;. This is an episode of a series, where performers, writers and producers analyze and talk about a classic album they helped create. In this case we get imput from producer Keith Olsen and all the members of the 'Rumors era' Fleetwood Mac.The documentary is excellent in giving us access to vintage film clips and beautiful stills of the band from the mid to late '70s.More importantly the members of the band give detailed stories and explanations of the real life 'soap opera' behind the album's songs. Some of them were funny (the band diving for a huge bag of fake cocaine, that was droped to the floor) or sad (how Christine McVie could barely talk to her former husband, while making the album).The viewer also gets to follow Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood and Producer, Ken Olsen into the original studio and listen to the recordings being broken down by their musical and vocal tracks. We get to hear the intricacies of Mick Fleetwood's expansive drumming style and how John McVie's bass led each song. The tracks also show what an underated guitarist, Lindsey Buckingham really is and the beauty in the stand alone harmonies of Stevie Knicks &amp; Christine McVie. But my favorite part of the documentary is Christine McVie's live performance of the tune &quot;Songbird&quot; at the very same auditorium she used to record it over twenty five years ago. Watching her perform this lovely, but heartbreaking song still sends shivers down my spine! If you are fan of Fleetwood Mac or just plain old rock n' roll in general, then this DVD is not to to be missed! Highly recommended!",

In fact, I own some old FM concert VHS tapes which I purchased when new (Tusk documentary, Mirage tour, etc). I look at the vaults on The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac cd and wonder why not DVD? Frustrating, they would look and sound great. Still, I never saw the Rumours photo session footage which is included on this DVD and that was an unexpected treat even if it was too short. I knew at the time of Rumours release that there was a lot of turmoil going on in the band but had no idea to what extent until I watched these interviews. All's well now apparently since they have a new cd due out in April. I sure will miss Christine, though. I recommend this DVD to any old diehard Fleetwood Mac fans who crave anything from those good old days and also to the new ones so that you can learn about their history.",

    "review/text": "A spectactular review of Rumours and of the group itself, this \"Classic Albums\" DVD adds to the already sizeable reputation of Fleetwood Mac. The original album alone speaks for itself (certainly one of the top 5 albums of all time) but to now hear all members dissect each song with memories and anecdotes on this DVD made these songs an extremely joyful experience all over again for me.Listening to the group discuss these classic songs now (these are 1997 interviews), one can still see some of the intense emotions that constituted the making of the album. Whether it's Lindsey Buckingham reminiscing about the making of \"Gold Dust Woman\" or Stevie Nicks talking about her emotions during the recording of \"Go Your Own Way\", the viewer gets a true feeling for the emotional committment that each member made during this period. Candid, intense and informal and also with the benefit of 20 years perspective, the producers have added another cornerstone in the ongoing drama that makes this group so popular.All song selections are also looked at from a sound engineers perspective using the original tapes and a multi track sound board. We see how the vocals were broken down and how the instrumentation fit in...basically how each song was built and what influences were used (i.e. Lindsey Buckingham admitting that he \"borrowed\" some \"textures\" from the Bee Gees song \"Jive Talking\"). Context of the times during these original recordings is a big part of each song's discussion and the mix of interviews with just the right amount of music makes this DVD a pleasure to watch over and over again.With Fleetwood Mac back out on the road again (for their 2003 Tour minus Christine McVie), the group will undoubtedly get another popularity injection...this DVD shows the group in relatively recent interviews and should show a different generation the \"power\" of Fleetwood Mac. Highest recommendation!!",

I've sent it to a few of my friends who are attending the 2009 Unleashed tour - seeing Fleetwood Mac for the first time - so they can appreciate what these songs meant to the members in the band and what was going on behind the scenes at the time. It includes fantastic filmed performances from the 70's of each song and the band members really open up in telling the story behind this amazing album and everything that was going on around them at the time. There's no doubt that, after watching this, you will be seeking out their other DVD's (and I still can't believe that the Tusk Documentary and Mirage Concert have not been re-released onto DVD!!!!!) The VHS copies still around are worth finding!Current recommendations: \"Destiny Rules\" the behind the scenes making of the \"Say You Will\" album - the last CD released by the band. Also - Live In Boston - both are longer in length than other concerts available from other bands - Highly recommended.",

We find our own experiences that we attached to the songs back in 1977 were perhaps rosier than those who wrote, sang and recorded this pop masterpiece. But we've all aged and experienced much of what these artists have and were immersed in at the time; and it's brave of them not only to have recorded it in the first place, but to return to the experience with such candor. And &quot;big&quot; love doesn't really leave us. Its face may change or we may hold it closer to or farther from us, but once we've experienced it, those chains will always &quot;keep us together.&quot; Very personal filmmaking here with exquisite sound.",

They were indeed the cuts I was looking for: Fleetwood Mac jamming live versions Rhiannon, You Make Loving Fun, and Dreams. Filmed in 16mm on what looks like their touring stage running through impressive live renditions of these tunes, I yelped with joy that I had these chestnuts on DVD. Unfortunately, on this disc they are present as small samples of the various songs, and cut down to about 30 seconds each. More than enough to tease the viewer but not enough to satisfy. Apparently the producers of this documentary felt that we would be happy to sit through lots of inerview segments on the making of Rumours, but not fantastic footage made at the time of Mac playing the songs. Having seen them, I now realize what a great band they are (and were) live, but I wish they hadnt snipped down these awesome videos for this release. Dangit.",

This in my opinion is the definative 1 on 1 bboy event of the year, bringing together some of the worlds top talent. Granted there are some editing problem, one of Hong10's signature moves isn't caught in his first battle with Moy (but if you go to the slow motion featurette you see it in all its illmatic glory) The single biggest flaw on this dvd is the original music is dubbed over by tracks from Dj Ace, who actually DJ'ed the event. It does suck and i hope there is an explanation as to why (i am guessing maybe they/Red Bull were not able to get the rights to the songs)but it is somewhat bearable. I also hope that this will mean the 2004 event will be on dvd soon, hopefully with its original music intact. Along with the new music there is a major flub during Storms set between the semi and final rounds. The screen goes white for a second and cuts to a front shot of Storm and a set worker using clappers to start the scene, I don't know how this got past the people who made this, its not like they had to rush, the event is over a year old. Regardless of the flaws this dvd is a must own, its that good.",

    "review/text": "Positives: This DVD showcases some of the most talented B-Boys in the world today. As a newcomer to the B-Boy scene, I'm constantly inspired by the level of skill demonstrated on this DVD. Cinematography is really nicely done, the B-Boys are filmed from a lower angle and it gives you that feeling of awe when you watch the dancers perform on stage. You simply have to check out the slow motion sequence in the bonus menu. Very nice.Negatives: I was disappointed when I found out that the DVD would not be playing the actual music that was being played during the competition. The music they replaced the original soundtrack with is basically hit and miss. Hit in some places, miss in others. Some editing choices need to be questioned, such as the unnecessary cuts showing the audience reacting when we would be better served with just keeping the focus only on the B-Boys themselves. The chapter selection screen could've used some additional work, I would've liked to have had access to the individual battles instead of having to fast forward through them because I'm only allowed to choose rounds, ie. semi-finals, quarter finals, finals, etc..The verdict...Despite the amount of negatives, the positives still outway them. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anybody, whether they be B-Boying or not. The breakdancing in this DVD is high level stuff, stuff I could only dream of doing. Highly entertaining and still enjoyable. Like I said, it's not perfect, but it's bloody awesome. I can't wait for the 2006 DVD to come out. Hopefully soon.",

    "review/text": "For those of you who purchased the 2004 edition you might remember how fun and exciting the dvd was because it was editied and synced perfectly with some really good songs (from the b-boy canon). The breakers fed off the music (watch Sonic sync his moves to Babe Ruth's The Mexican) as did the crowd and that energy transfers over to the audience watching at home.Unfortunately the 2005 edition takes out all of the music that was presumably played during the actual battles and this leaves an artificial feel to the battle. I assume that they couldn't get the rights for some of the songs and so they've replaced it with some non-descript filler music that sounds like it came off a generic \"learn to b-boy\" record. The songs aren't that bad it's just that they're unfamiliar and as a result uninspiring. To see the difference watch the 2005 trailer on Youtube where they use RJD2 and DJ Shadow effectively or the Star TV review where the use of music will get you as fired up as the b-boys (you've never heard Gloria Estefan used so effectively!). At least they kept the original music for Hilty & Bosch.The breaking on the other hand is top notch. These guys truly are representing the best in the world and the dvd is worth it just to see the moves and the competition. This dvd could have been so much better than what it is, hence the 3 stars.",

However, do we not realize that if allowed to be true to one's nature, it would not be psychologically troubling at all, but, rather, liberating. Thank you for an incredible story, one I was thrilled to claim as my own. I thank the universe for the courage to be true to my nature and the life that courage has allowed me to live. Thankfully I did not have to sacrifice my mental health or my children; but have enjoyed a rich relationship with all for the past 12 years.

    "review/text": "This is a thinking woman's type movie. For this concerns one that has reached a certain age, a certain stature, 'happily' married with a child and then the dawning (and daunting) realization that her life is a hollow shell. Self expression without self, an artist barely passed a failed suicide riddled with doubt now neither a wife or a mother. Then there is an awakening back to herself - an epiphany of who she is and who she wants. But at what cost?Helen Mirren plays this role like a suit of clothing, her sheer ability to progress from a drugged automaton to the self aware woman that 'what she has is not enough'. The supporting cast of Kyra Sedgwick as the nanny/nurse and Beau Bridges as the trying to comprehend husband are also excellent. Without revealing the plot the interaction of the three actors is superb.The plotline is totally believable and realistic - there are no true villains here (or heroes) just everyday people trying to cope with life situations that are almost more then they can handle. I felt empathy with each of the characters, their actions and reactions were totally understandable within the framework of the film.So, bottom line, this is a good movie but it is definitely character driven. Personal awareness and growth are themes that resonant to all.",

I was asking myself why Sedgwick would want to take on such a challenging task of taking care of a woman in her condition when she had already had to deal with it in her own family. However, the movie gelled for me when she faced off with Mirren in the pouring rain in such a tormented state trying to find answers to her past. This not only was a healing moment for Elizabeth, but a turning point for Chase as well. This movie showed the depth of a woman who went along and played by all the rules, until it proved too much. I was a little sad at the end when Chase's husband left and found another woman, yet Elizabeth did not stay. But the title does sort of give it away. You felt good though, knowing she had a new direction in life and a better understanding of herself.",

    "review/text": "November 18, 2006Location ARCO Arena,Sacramento, CaliforniaIn the headline fight of the night, Georges St. Pierre finally gets his chance at redemption against the champion that had barely defeated him early on in his career. St. Pierre, now a seasoned and complete fighter, gets another crack at welterweight giant, Matt Hughes. The co-main event features heavyweight champion, Tim Sylvia, defending his coveted title against challenger Jeff Monson.The night opens with Joe \"Daddy\" Stevenson (Matt Hughes's first selection on The Ultrimate Fighter Season 2) vs. Dokonjonosuke Mishima. Stevenson, already a veteran in MMA, impresses once again.Next, rising heavyweight (should probably be light heavyweight) star Brandon Vera gets his \"biggest\" fight yet in the UFC against former champion on the comeback trail, Frank Mir. Mir has not looked good at all in his comeback fights inside the octagon and now he is facing a younger, faster fighter in Vera. Vera has made the claim that he would eventually secure both the light heavyweight and heavyweight belts, but let's just concentrate on beating the washed up fighter in front of you to pad your record first. This one is fun to watch...Everyone loves a standup fight - and that is what we would all expect from Alessio Sakara and Drew McFedries. Sakara is a boxing champ from Italy and McFedries seems to be the new \"Robbie Lawler\" out of team Miletich. This one is a slugfest!UFC newcomer Hector Ramirez takes on James \"Sandman\" Irvin. This is a decent fight and you won't have to sit through three full rounds, as it does not go the distance.Co-main event time!!!! Feel free to take a nap at this point. Just as expected, the very short Jeff Monson has extreme difficulty getting past the lurching Tim Sylvia's long arms. Sylvia doesn't do much to try to end this one and Monson can't seem to do much, so this one just wears on and on.The fight we all wanted to see: welterweight champion Matt Hughes finally faces Georges St. Pierre again. St. Pierre had lost to Hughes via a last second armbar submission way back at UFC 50. He had not been quite ready for that challenge then, but he is a different fighter now. Whether you already know the outcome of this fight or not, it is a true masterpiece. This is a must see. One man decides to play a dangerous game in this fight and he pays the painful price for it.The DVD also contains a good deal of bonus footage from the days leading up to the fight. This is worth a watch. I highly recommend this DVD if for nothing other than the main event.",

This was an ok fight O'Brien controlled the whole fight basically taking Josh down every time they were stood up. Over all this was a decent start to the event.2.JAMES IRVIN vs. HECTOR RAMIREZ-Irvin takes this fight in the second round with a beautiful straight right hand that catches Ramirez after he throws a lazy left hook. The entire fight was great; this was an excellent addition to the card.3.SHERMAN PENDERGARST vs. ANTONI HARDONK-this was a great fight, back and forth while the fight lasted, Antoni takes this fight after a nice combo with a left, right punch combo followed immediately by a vicious leg kick that takes out Sherman. This was a very entertaining fight, nice bout.4.NICK DIAZ vs. GLEISON TIBAU-the first round of this fight was amazing, a great technical battle on the ground. Both fighters were giving it all they had, but by the end Tibau was gassing and looking pretty bad. In the second round Tibau was far too gone and gassed out, basically Diaz just out lasted him and got the win when the ref stopped the fight.5.JOE STEVENSON vs. D. MISHIMA-this one ends in the first round when Mishma taps out after a deep guillotine choke, it would take two of these though to get him to tap out. This was a good but quick fight, nice edition to the show.6.FRAMK MIR vs. BRANDON VERA-extremely surprising how quick this match was, I did not expect this fight to be over at just over one minute. After a well placed knee from Vera Mir goes down and is dominated on the ground, great win for Vera.7.ALESSIO SAKARA vs. DREW McFEDRIES-very exciting fight between these two warriors, this was a beautiful back and forth battle standing up. It looked as if Drew was winning the stand up but soon Sakara was taking over the lead. The round went back and forth between the two until Sakara sir came to Drew towards the end of the round when the ref stopped it. Excellent fight, possibly the best on the card.8.[HEAVYWIEGHT CHAMPIONSHIP] TIM SYLVIA vs. JEFF MONSON-this was a pretty good fight between these two gladiators of the octagon. This fight would end up going the distance and have a sorry crowd in my opinion. After a really good fight that showcased both fighters really well, the crowd started booing Sylvia just because he didn't knockout Jeff. They should have shown the proper respect to both fighters and applauded these two for giving up a great fight. Over all Tim wins by decision.9.[WELTERWIEGHT CHAMPIONSHIP] MATT HUGHES vs. GEORGE ST. PIERRE-my favorite fight of the evening saw GSP defeat Matt Hughes with a some what dominate performance. I really have never liked Hughes to much but this fight changed that. His sportsmanship after his loss changed my mind about the man as I thought he would cry about the loss. But he didn't and one of my all time favorites GSP became the champ with an excellent performance with a great TKO victory over a great defending champ in Hughes",

    "review/text": "This is the most difficult kind of a review to write: a movie that had absolutely no impact on the reviewer at all. The film exists. I exist. I experienced the film. After the film, what did I take away from it? Nothing. (I'm forcing myself to write this, because after doing seventeen one dollar DVD reviews, I'm far too anal to simply start skipping titles now.)VENGEANCE VALLEY (1951) is a movie that I wouldn't expect many people to love, but which I also wouldn't expect many people to hate either. There's just not a lot of substance to get excited one way or the other.Ray Collins (Boss Jim Gettys in CITIZEN KANE) is the aging owner of a cattle ranch. He has two grown sons: one who was adopted as a child (Burt Lancaster) and one biological son (Robert Walker). The adopted son is this western's good son and the biological is the movie's bad son.That's basically all you now need to know. The good son moves through the picture doing good deeds and picking up the pieces left behind by his bad brother who goes around being -- you guessed it -- bad. That sentence summaries about ninety percent of the movie's scenes. There's no questionable morality, no ethical ambiguity, no real reason to think much, give any thought to the character's inner lives or even to think of them as real people at all.As an aside, there would appear to be the glimmers of a good idea buried deep within the backstory. It's the adopted son who turns out good. Is there some resentment from their shared childhood that turns the biological son into a twisted, petty, immature adult? Ray Collins mentions that he adopted Lancaster partly because he needed help raising Walker. Was it the influence of this boring and disgustingly moral older sibling that turned Walker from the path of nice to the path of naughty? Was Walker damned from birth? Unfortunately, the movie doesn't seem very interested in these questions.What makes the film even more unlikable is that even within the broad strokes of the good guy vs. bad guy characterizations, the individual people aren't even portrayed in an interesting manner. For instance, given that Robert Walker is an out and out baddie, you'd have hoped that the filmmakers could have made him an interesting villain - a bad guy you could cheer for, or at least sympathize with. But he isn't a powerful and strong evil guy. His bad nature is communicated through him being extraordinarily whiny, sniveling and annoying. Sure, this makes the audience dislike him, but it doesn't make him fun to watch.The only character I really enjoyed seeing was played by John Ireland. He enters the film initially seeking revenge for his sister (she's impregnated and then abandoned) and later becomes the bad son's hit man. Ireland understands how to create an enjoyable villain. He scowls, growls and grumbles. He also has the advantage of getting the script's best lines: \"I'm gonna kill a man before I leave here,\" he barks at the town's sheriff immediately after getting off the inbound train. (\"Anybody special, or will I do?\" retorts the sheriff.) This is how to portray a villain with no redeeming characteristics at all. Make him fully bad; don't make him annoying.(Incidentally, John Ireland is a popular fellow in the Wal*Mart one dollar DVD bin. Without trying or realizing, I've managed to pick up at least three of his films. It's a shame the movies themselves all been pretty lousy, but I've been entertained by Ireland's performances in all three.)Other than John Ireland, I really can't think of much else to recommend about the film. (The cattle ranching sequences are done well, if you're really into cows.) The only thing I believe I'll remember about this movie is that typing up this review taught me how to spell \"vengeance\" properly. (Three e's. Who knew?)",

    "review/text": "This interminable wannabe thriller set in Palm Beach and directed by Andy Wolk has many distinguishing features, none of them very good. Probably the best thing is Lorraine Bracco using her slow speech patterns to add character touches to her femme fatale role. However Wolk inexplicably doesn't know what to do with her, and eventually she gets shunted to the side, so he can bore us with the labrynthine plot convolutions of a search for a serial killer who over-applies Yves St Laurent ruby red lipstick clown-like to his victims. Wolk miscasts James Belushi as a womanising detective, as if his bull manner and loud-voice would appeal to women, though since the victims are all women associated with Belushi, that may be motivation enough. Belushi is the kind of policeman that litters in the street and in his own home, and has a fondness for faux big band music - Dinah Washington slaughtering These Foolish Things. One wonders if making some swamp bad guys all overweight is an attempt to scale down Belushi's own stockiness, and he pales next to Bracco in their scenes together, she making him look even more amateurish. The screenplay by Jim Piddock is full of impossible lines - &quot;In Palm Beach there are 3 lives: public, private and secret&quot;, &quot;time was money and the girls were bigtime&quot;, &quot;Don't start asking me about my experiences. You could become one of them&quot;, &quot;Don't try to make me into something I'm not. How do you know what you're not?&quot;, and &quot;You're not who you thought you were, boy&quot;. The contextual assumption of Belushi's opening narration is taken from Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, but more troubling is the connection Piddock wants to make between child abuse and womanising. The narrative actually improves about of the way in when Belushi's partner, Tony Goldwyn takes over the investigation in Key West. He matches up better with Bracco, and a sex scene is more convincing than the ones in which Belushi participates, partly because Goldwyn is a more attractive specimen. Although Goldwyn doesn't have a leading man persona, he at least suggests more emotional depth and psychological dimension. Wolk gives Bracco's office a huge carpet with lipstick pattern, has her leave an apple in a fruit bowl with a bite taken out of it, puts heavy breathing on his soundtrack, and casts Edgar Allan Poe IV in a supporting role.",

    "review/text": "3 Stars=\"It's OK.\"I ordered this blu-ray after a recent trip to Seattle and Vancouver, and thought it would be fun to see what we missed and also to say \"Hey! We went to that!\" etc. While the video quality is EXCELLENT, and the host is quite likeable, I found myself pretty unsatisfied. I was thinking the videos would focus more on \"touristy\" things, and offer a variety and \"best of\" or at least \"must see\" attractions. I've been to two out of the three places in this video, and while entertaining, it didn't really offer much interesting ideas for me. Having never been to San Francisco as an adult, I did find some ideas, but after watching the Seattle and Vancouver ones, I can only imagine what was left out. Most likely, quite a bit. Each episode is only a half hour. I was just expecting more of a touristy type show, as I am not familar with this series. Maybe I should have researched it better, but don't have a travel show if you're not going to show me the best of what a city has to offer. Unlike \"No Reservations\" where you generally don't get a lot of touristy ideas, you still get a \"feel\" for the city and it's overall vibe. This video seemed to me like watching a jolly guy go to a city, eat some food, drink some wine, then quickly go over some things you should see that someone told him were cool things to see.If you are planning on buying these videos as sort of an idea maker for a future trip, and would like to focus on \"touristy\" ideas, this video collection doesn't offer very much. BUT, if you have already been to these places and are looking for ideas that aren't so \"touristy,\" then you might like this blu-ray, as it has some odd highlights. SO, depending on what kind of traveler you are, you may find this blu-ray enjoyable.Or if you are just looking for a staycation video, to enjoy places from the comfort of your own home, you will most likely be delighted with the great scenery, picture quality, interesting showcases, and likeable host.3 stars for me. :)",

This blu ray misses the best of that city entirely.Why didn't it show Golden Gate Park? That is the best thing San Francisco has to offer. The Japanese Gardens there, or the Young Art Museum, or the Science Academy, or the botanical gardens? Golden Gate Park is the most unique, largest, and fabulous park outside of New York's Central Park. It is so incredible and has so many different things to do and see there that to omit it from this blu ray is a crime.It touched on Haight Ashbury so briefly that it might as well have not shown it at all. San Francisco is famous for its inspiration of a whole generation of hippies in the 60s and 70s. Haight Ashbury still has many head shops and it is unique, because no where else in the world is there a Haight Ashbury.This blu ray spent way too much time in Chinatown, which is nice, but it took time away from other amazing San Francisco attractions. It did show the making of sour dough bread, which is a San Francisco specialty, so that is a plus.But how about the beaches? Why didn't it show the amazing Pacific Coast? You can see wildlife like starfish right there on the beach. Or focus a bit more closely on the street performers at the Piers, and visit a couple of restaurants instead of focusing on just one? What about the fresh seafood sold right there on the Pier in open markets? We all know about the cable cars, but what about the ferries? How about a trip up Nob Hill? What about the theater district or the night life?You can tell I live close to San Francisco. This is a city that stands apart from others, and this blu ray most certainly did not get that message across.But its presentation of Seattle was top notch, and worth the price of the blu ray. I offer no opinion on Vancouver because I have never been there.",

Given that his grasp so obviously outstrips the reach of his talents, it's perhaps best for all concerned that this plan fell through.That Stephen Williams is now toiling on bland, Canadian made-for-TV movies comes as no surprise. However, why his brother Peter hasn't gone on to much better things is a mystery that Sherlock Holmes would be hard pressed to solve.",

    "review/text": "As the eldest son of Virginia McKenna and the late Bill Travers - and as CEO of Born Free USA and The Born Free Foundation - I found it hard to watch Elsa's Legacy: The Born Free Story since it touched on so many issues that lie close to my heart. The footage of the old days, the extracts from George's diaries, clips from the movie (Born Free), all these resonated terrifically with me as I recalled the year spend in Kenya while my parents (who portrayed Joy and George) worked on the film. The legacy of those days, so wonderfully told in the PBS show, is a profound message - that wild animals do not belong in zoos but should be permitted to live wild and free. Today, this lies at the heart of what Born Free does all around the world. The deprivation and suffering imposed on wild animals in so many zoos, the crude animal exploitation of the circus, the (frankly) madness of keeping wild animals as 'pets', are issues that we must challenge, expose and bring to an end with every ounce of our compassionate soul. Joy, George, Virginia and Bill have set our moral compass for the future when it comes to our relationship with wild animals. We must do all in our power - supported by growing numbers of compassionate people all around the world - to concentrate our efforts, our money and our dedication on protecting wild animals in wild places for, without them, we shall end up with zoos - perhaps we'll call them 'living museums' - where a few hundred carefully-selected species will exist to remind us of what we once had and what we lost. The wild is the conservation front line. It is where we must take a stand. Elsa's Legacy is the change of mind-set that Born Free (the book, the film, the Nature TV show and now the two organisations I have the honour to serve) have brought into sharp focus. I invite everyone who cares to join us by going to the Born Free USA website and becoming part of the next chapter in this amazing story. Thank you. Will",

    "review/text": "Last year, the BBC produced an excellent 60-minute show titled, \"The Born Free Legacy\". It was an excellent look at George and Joy Adamson and their pioneering work with animals, most notably (of course) Elsa the lioness. It lived up to its title of describing the world-changing effects \"Born Free\" has had. One of the most striking visual examples was of pictures children sent to Dr. Desmond Morris--before Born Free, children saw lions as creatures behind bars, unhappy and fierce. After Born Free, they started drawing lions as happy animals living on vast plains. (None of this is in the 50-minute, completely altered PBS version of this show titled Elsa's Legacy.)I have serious doubts about whether whoever scripted the PBS show ever read the book Born Free, or saw the movie. Repeatedly throughout the show, Born Free is referred to as a \"fairy tale\" and a \"myth\". What is going on here?The PBS show also has a fascination with death, spending a long time on Virginia McKenna visiting Elsa's grave, and on an emotional re-telling of George Adamson's murder and funeral. But what's most amazing is that PBS's version says practically nothing about the \"legacy\" mentioned in the title.The BBC show, \"The Born Free Legacy\", not only does not have these faults, it is overall a more realistic and compelling telling of the events that began over 50 years ago and continue to shape the world today.If the BBC ever releases \"The Born Free Legacy\" on DVD, THAT is the version of this show that is worth watching.",

    "review/text": "UFC 64UNSTOPPABLEThis was a very historic event in my mind, mainly because of the huge upset that regardless of what people say now was not expected.1.KURT PELLEGRINO VS JUNIOR ASSUNCAO-this was a quick opening fight to the event with a great rear naked choke applied by Kurt. Junior did the best he could in this one but he was over come early by Kurt. A great quick opening bout.5/52.CLAY GUIDA VS JUSTIN JAMES-the first round of this fight was amazing, both of these guys came to fight and win. It was back and forth between these two the entire round, Clay even gets caught in a deadly arm bar yet slips out. The second round was just as exciting as it went back and forth until it had 20 seconds left in the round. That is were it ended with Clay getting the win with a nice rear naked choke.5/53.YUSHIN OKAMI VS KALIB STARNES-good enough first round between these two as most of it is just a feeling out process. Other then a few kicks and punches, and a take down that almost ends it there isn't much in this round. The second round is less active as it is mostly in the clinch the whole round, there is a good take down though. Round 3 more exciting as Okami not only mounts Kalib but also pounds his way to a victory.3.5/54.SPENCER FISHER VS DAN LAUZON-this is another quick yet exciting fight as Dan gets two great take downs and even supplies some good ground and pound. But Spencer ends this towards the end of the first with a great knock out, it was obvious that Dan wanted no part of that.5/55.CHEICK KONGO VS CARMELO MARRERO-round one was real good as Marrero who I thought at the time was going to get destroyed completely dominated Kongo. He took Cheick down and pounded on him the entire round, Kongo really had no answer for it. Round two was exactly the same except without all the ground and pound, although Kongo almost ended it with a guillotine choke. Round three was a little different because it was almost entirely on the feet, except for a little while with Kongo on top this time. Carmelo takes a split decision, although it should have been unanimous in my opinion.3.5/56.JON FITCH VS KUNIYOSHI HIRONAKA-the first round of this fight is amazing as Fitch spends almost all of it inside a deep triangle. He comes back at the end of the round and almost stops it him self. The second round sees Fitch deliver some great kicks and when these two go to the ground it is nothing short of a chess match between these two warriors. In round three both are bloody both are tired and both are still in it giving it all they have. This is by far one of the best fights on an over all good card, Fitch takes a well deserved decision.5/57.SEAN SHERK VS KENNY FLORIAN-this was the fight that would crown the first Lightweight champion after years of the title laying dormant in the UFC. Once the fight started Kenny was taken down, but then it got even. These two battled the entire time on the ground, both on offense and defense against each, usually it is one or the other. The second round is a bloodier version of the first, both just battle on the ground for the most part. The third is just like the first two, but with a great explosion from each at the end. The following round followed the same formula as the previous, but it was never boring. The final round went the distance looking just like the others, but like I said this fight never seemed boring. In fact to me it felt pretty epic. Sean Sherk wins by decision and becomes the new Lightweight champion.5/58.RICH FRANKLIN VS ANDERSON SILVA-this is that fight I was talking about earlier, I don't care what you say everybody thought Franklin was going to take this. Even if some one thought Silva was going to win this I bet no one saw a first round domination coming. I remember watching this live and thinking no way Rich just got it put on him that bad. Of course looking back now I' am sure every one can believe it and even say they knew it would happen. But at the time it was unbelievable. Still to this day one of the best beat downs in history, right up there with GSP destroying Matt Hughes. Silva just killed Rich's body with some vicious knees and then landed a killer head kick.5/5",

    "review/text": "So, Anderson Silva smeared Chris Leben in a Fight Night in about 49 seconds, right? You take out Leben like that, you've got to be pretty good, or are you? Let's just give the man a title shot to see how good he really is. Doesn't sound too fair, does it? Anderson Silva taking on a seasoned champion such as Rich Franklin. How long could this possibly last? But Rich Franklin admits that this will be his toughest test. Anderson Silva really has no doubts. But then again, neither did Nate Quarry in UFC 56, and Franklin knocked him out, and Quarry was O-U-T! So Franklin is prepared to defend his Middleweight Championship belt. And for the first time in a little while, the UFC is prepared to give a Lightweight Championship to one of two contenders. Sean Sherk and Kenny Florian want that victory! Sherk simply claims that he isn't about to take Kenny lightly, because he is fighting for a world championship title. And with Sherk's experience, he's only lost twice. But in UFC 56, he was TKO'd by none other than GSP, and quite decisively! Kenny Florian, on the other hand, hasn't lost since the first Ultimate Fighter Finale when it went rather quickly against Diego Sanchez. But since then he's shown he isn't one to be messed around with. His elbows are lethal, and fighters such as Alex Karalexis found that out. Kenny sums this fight up pretty easily by saying, \"That first mistake he makes, he's cooked.\" But will it really be that easy?This is a pretty good night. There are 8 fights total, and I'll list them below.Kurt Pelligrino vs. Junior Assuncao: Two quick and scrappy lightweights. This doesn't take too long and finishes in the first round.Clay Guida vs. Justin James: Both men ready to get it on! Wild and wooly Guida against an opponent with some fights under his belt. Both are making UFC debuts, and one wins in round two!Yushin Okami vs. Kalib Starnes: This features two veterans, both seasoned in the game of MMA. Starnes comes off some great TUF #3 time, while Okami knows his game and knows how to win. This is a decent battle that ends before the third round comes to a close.Spencer Fisher vs. Dan Lauzon: When big brother Joe, KO's Jens Pulver in UFC 63, then little brother, Dan, gets to take on Pulver's teammate. And just like the Pulver fight, this ends in the first round as well. Good start or bad start for 18 year old Dan Lauzon? YOU watch the fight!Cheick Kongo vs. Carmelo Marrero: Kongo has knock-out power, that's obvious! But newcomer Marrero has some great ground n' pound. This goes to a split decision that is well earned. The right man won the fight.Jon Fitch vs. Kuniyoshi Hironaka: This is a great battle! It goes to a unanimous decision.Sean Sherk vs. Kenny Florian: Well, this is a battle, and it goes to a decision. One man gets the title, while the other still put up a great fight the whole way through!Rich Franklin vs. Anderson Silva: This was by far the surprise of the night! Needless to say, it doesn't make it past a round. WOW!!!A night full of fights, some quite surprising! So if you haven't seen this yet, go for it! Not disappointing at all. By the way, meet Anderson Silva!",

I bought this DVD to enjoy watching Silva/Franklin over and over and over again, but I started getting a headache two minutes into it. Stay away from this. The UFC needs to do something about this because it's unacceptable for a company so successful to release such low quality garbage.",

    "review/text": "I have no idea why the director, German Christoph Dreher, decided to give this 57 minute documentary this title - or why the video company chose the packaging., but this is a hidden gem of a documentary on Brian Wilson and his music and a must for Wilson fans.The film was made in 1997 - and so references to the \"Smile\" album never being released are a bit premature. All the titles and on screen descriptions are in GERMAN, but all the sound (interviews, songs etc) are in ENGLISH.Starting out with the history of surf music, the film includes rare interviews with the Chantays, Don Was, and Dick Dale. Lots of rare promo films made by Capitol for the Beach Boys are also here. The film focuses on Brian Wilson's early years as well as his drug problem for about 45 minutes. About 2/3 through we get to the Psychedelic Years of music and see Janis Joplin perform at Monterey Pop Fest. Then an odd connection is made between Dennis Wilson being friends with Charles Manson and the film veers off to discuss the Manson murders. Then it's back to Brian, who has nothing at all to do with Manson.Some of the real highlights are newly filmed (well, new in 1997) interviews with Brian at his home at the piano (where he plays \"Love and Mercy\").A big problem with this release is that it is not \"indexed\" and it is ONE long 57-minute chapter, so you can't go back to a specific song or subject.Again, this is a quirky - misleadingly packaged - DVD that all Beach Boy and Brian Wilson fans will want to check out. And the video quality is very good.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\"",

I was intrigued by the title; I thought \"ooooh... a dark and creepy look at the mid-sixties LA music scene & how good ol' Brian Wilson sold his soul the the Devil in exchange for his songwriting gifts. Sounds fascinating!\". I knew that Manson (as a struggling musician with dubious talent) had played around the fringes of the aforementioned scene & that he had somewhat of a tangential tie to Dennis Wilson (via Terry Melcher).As fate would have it, I didn't buy tBB&tS; on that day, & I pretty much forgot about it.Yesterday, I found myself in the very same store & as I passed the DVD rack, there it was. \"I'm not going to pass it up this time\" I told myself & I snapped it up.I got it home... popped into the player... & now all I have to say is, \"what a bloody disappointment!\". Suffice if to say that my above mentioned assumptions were nothing more that wishful thinking & apart from a brief mention of Melcher's associations with Manson and Dennis Wilson, what you have here are two short documentaries, neither all that informative, that just happen to co-habitate the same disc.If you are familiar with the story of the Beach Boys & you've read Helter Skelter, there's really nothing new for you here. True, there was an informative look at Brian & his particular form of eccentricity; & the claim that the Tate/Labianca hit might actually have been intended for Melcher and Mark Lindsey was a new one on me, but other than that... yuck.As for me... I'm off to eBay to find a buyer for this & recoup at least SOME of my investment!",

Conch houses and their gardens could in themselves be the subject for an entire DVD, as could the history of wrecking. No mention at all of the railroad that was so important to opening up the Keys, or of the military history of the area (apart from a brief mention of the Dry Tortugas).If you have been to Key West the DVD will make you feel nostalgic, and if you havn't been it might encourage you to go, but on the whole it was only of average quality.

Its picture of a girl's purple, disembodied head against the background of a father's anguished figure - suggests a serial killer, or at the very least, a chilling series of abductions. The movie actually deals with neither.\"Disappeared\" is in reality just a sort of flat following of a father's quest through the back alleys of Istanbul as he attempts to locate his daughter. There is the possibility that she has been diverted into the hellishness of the sex slave trade, or that she has met some other miserable end. But the movie fails to capitalize on any such lurid possibilities. It boils down to Ray Winstone confronting a roundabout, confusing series of Turkish underworld figures and wheelers-and-dealers, trying to gather leads to his daughter's whereabouts.Winstone, who although not a stereotypically handsome leading man, still usually commands the screen whenever he appears. Not here though. Here he is reduced to alternating between annoying whimpers and annoying, counterproductive rages.There are a few saving graces about this film. We do get glimpses of what Istanbul's exotic byways are like - with their stone pavements, labyrinthine curves, and the stuccoed facades that line them. I was once or twice reminded of the famous de Chirico painting in which an ominous shadow looms onto the narrow, stuccoed gallery of such a Byzantine back street. Who or what is about to come around that corner at you?But again, the film itself doesn't deliver on these cinematic suggestions of intrigue and menace. It's neither suspense nor outright family drama, but a sort of nondescript meandering in the gray zone between the two.",

Thethe filming is fine, with a pleasing true widescreen on DVD.The 1980's style is visible, the actors male and femalse generouslygrowing their hair shoulder-length, yet, the movie has aged well inalmost all aspects.There are a number of catchy, clever, funny phrases, doubleentendres, gags that keep the humor going such as \"Young men arelike fast food.. quick but not all that good!\"There's also a short nude shower scene, for those documenting. It isin this movie, that Kinski sports a Halloween hog mask, and not inHotel New Hampshire.Armand Assante is almost unrecognizable from his height, youth andnice guy image shown here, unlike many later roles as a tough guy.",

The best scene of all for this musician: Moore and Assante playing \"Czardas\" as a violin duet, Moore leaping around the restaurant while furiously trying to spear Assante with his bow.",

    "review/summary": "Dudley Moore at his best",
    "review/text": "If you find Dudley Moore to be a very funny guy you will love this movie. Apart from \"10\" this is the \"must have\" Moore comedy. He, along with Nastassja Kinski and Armand Assante go through a myriad of scenarios involving the perception of infidelity. The cast is further enhanced by Albert Brooks and Richard Libertiny. Moore plays a middle-aged composer/conductor named Claude Eastman, Assante plays his best friend and famous violinist Max Stein. Nastassja Kinski plays Moore's wife Daniella who is about half Claude's age. The plot revolves around a lot of misunderstandings and misreadings between the main characters resulting in Claude's convictions about his wife and Max having an affair. Brooks' character is named Norman and is married to Carla (Cassie Yates). Libertiny plays Guiseppe who as Claude's buttler is hilarious with is thick Italian accent. Norman misunderstands Guiseppe and hires a private-eye to keep tabs on Daniella. He figures that is what his pal Claude wanted when in reality all he wanted was for him to look after her. Claude in turn gets a report from the private-eye who himself misconstrudes the information. Armed with what he thinks is proof, Claude sets a plan to get rid of his infidel wife and her lover (Assante). What happens after that is the juxtaposition of the events as Claude planned them and how they really turn out. The humor is silly and yet very clever. Moore's performance is fantastic as he plays another scene where his character is drunk (a la Arthur and very funny). My favorite scene happens in the kitchen and involves Moore and Assante (I will not reveal it so that you see it for yourselves). Brooks is well suited to play Norman against Yate's Carla who ends up being the one who starts it all. In all, the movie plays very well, is one of my all-time-favorite comedies and it could not have been casted any better. It almost feels as if the cast lived together for a while in order to nail their characters as well as they did. Films like this are hard to come by these days. Hollywood seems to concentrated in putting a lot of money and effects in their fare leaving films like this to smaller independent outfits. The movie also keeps a pretty high decorum regarding the handling of sexual themes. Once again, content over hype. This film prooves that you don't have to get rauchy or rely on gross-out humor to be funny. I highly recommend this film.",

    "review/text": "What I thought at first to be farcical comedy, turned into the genre of the horror story popular in Europe where the man become psychologically demented and going deeper and deeper into Freudian hysteria. This is not funny anymore but becomes a horror film in the classic style, much like the movie with Kinski before \"Cat People.\" We see the protagonist become more and more demented with his own problem- this goes to a classic movie genre, and Kinski continues to show Hollywood how a film should be made in old school genre of the psychological horror.It would take more research, but this form of psychological thriller horror film done in an artistic style was literally invented in Germany with the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and did finally come to America where the horror film continued from the 20s onward. How much did Kinski have her hand in the idea of this film; I would assume a lot, since I have seen very few films like this that were not out of Europe, the only difference is Kinski seems to have taught the director and actors how to act in a \"European manor\" or acting. However because the English language isn't suited in the same fashion, it looks oddly out of place in this American film.I am not sure why the other reviewers said this was funny. After the first 10 minutes it was not funny at all but pure psychological horror if not Freudian. This is where Kinski parts from the norm in aspects of pure cinematic genius; she is a ton smarter about acting and movie philosophy than lets on. Kinski has gotten Dudley Moore and other actors to act how she see fits, as they obviously are good, working actors but that's where it ends-- they have not been taught acting in the classic sense-- and that is where this movie runs into more trouble and falls short of a masterpiece. But fortunately, the screen loves Kinski and she is a master at this genre of movie and the only one in the film, making the film impossible to stop watching as you see the master actress Kinski, carrying the film. No one on the set or other actors can keep pace with her utter and perfect brilliance, she is working on all cylinders here, and it is obvioiusly true then she is one of the best, classic, trained actresses of our time--- however it doesn't lift this nice try out of the doldrums.",

Worse, he thinks she is playing around with his prot?g?, a notorious womanizer. Its untrue but coincidences mount up to reinforce the idea until he is blind with rage and plots both of their murders.It sound very serious thus far but remember that the jealous husband is played by Dudley Moore. That means that this is a comedy as he puts his plot into action with Moore's typically inept style. Nothing goes as planned and each instance is usually good for a few laughs.This film was NOT as funny as I remembered it being when I was a kid but I did laugh and I did enjoy it. Particularly effective is the use of classical music to set the mood throughout. Often, the pieces used are familiar and even stereotypical but that does not stop them from being appropriate or well chosen.",

Dudley made the film so much more funny. By seeing both versions you can why Dudley was a comic genius. I miss him. Dudley makes clear what screwballs we humans are. And he takes ordinary script lines and makes them very funny. Many of the elements of a Shakespearean comedy are in this film, but unlike the plays, this film has a terrific music score, has beautiful photography, and has simple dialogue. What makes this film great, for those mature enough to understand it, is Dudley Moore. I am not sure, but, to me, the concert hall looks very much like the one at the California Institute of Technology.This film is a remake of the much earlier black-and-white version, and the remake, unlike most remakes, is superior to the original.",

    "review/text": "I'm not exactly sure which version of &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; I've seen first, but the original Preston Sturges verison is my favorite among his films, which is a pretty large order considering this is the same man who directed &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot; and &quot;The Lady Eve&quot;.Given my feelings towards the original I wasn't sure if I'd like this remake. It has almost become a Hollywood rule remakes are never on par with the originals. Just as sequels are not as good as the original.Howard Zieff's &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; is a nice exception. I admit I don't think it's quite as good as the Sturges film (that one I would give 4 stars) it is still entertaining and funny at moments. I thought the absence of Preston Sturges would cause a decrease in the comedic possibilities, but, I forgot how good Dudley Moore and Albert Brooks are.Moore plays Claude Eastman a famous conductor who suspects his much younger wife Daniella (Nastassja Kinski) is cheating on him after the thought is first put into his head when a misunderstanding between Claude and his friend Norman (Albert Brooks) takes place and Norman thought Claude wanted him to hire a detective to watch his wife while Claude was out of town.Howard Zieff is not exactly what I would call a great director, he was the man behind &quot;The Main Event&quot; and the &quot;My Girl&quot; films, but, he strings things together nicely here. The script, while perhaps not as funny as Sturges' is not completely a dud. Barry Levinson had a hand in the remake, so expects some funny bits.One of my favorite scenes is at the restaurant when Moore &quot;thinks&quot; Armand Assante is confronting him about having an affair with his wife, and the start a dueling violin contest of Tchaikovsky.Also I should mention I the film's one advantage. In the scene dealing with Moore's plan to kill his wife it's set-up much funnier.Bottom-line:Remake of the classic Preston Sturges comedy is not exactly as good as the original but offers its own nice moments. Good performances by Moore and Brooks (who isn't used enough).",

Not only are the scares all there, but the writing in both episodes raises some interesting questions about sex, fame, and money in America.\"FIRE FALL\" is a study in envy and frustrated desires worthy of Russell Banks at his best. A small time hood who once dreamed of success as a classical musician is gunned own in a penny arcade. But he comes back as an angry ghost with the power to incinerate anyone he hates in a freak fire! Still more chilling, Frankie Markov's real desire is to \"take over\" the life of golden boy society composer Ryder Bond.What makes this episode really work is the smoldering anger of the murdered hood. The more Kolchak digs into the story, the more of a picture we get of class in America. Frankie never got a break. His wife is a cheap tramp, his bosses betrayed him, and his dreams were all betrayed through no fault of his own.On the other hand, Ryder Bond has a life of unlimited possibilities. Success in his art, rewarding career, glamorous lifestyle, flattering public attention, and in private the attentions of a lovely and adoring French girlfriend. Even while you hate to see how the angry working class \"ghost\" torments this poor man, you can see why Frankie hates Ryder so much. He wants to be Ryder too!Kolchak, very interestingly, does not seem to empathize with the ghost of Frankie, even though they are both working class guys. But he does everything he can to help Ryder retain his sanity and defeat the tormenting ghost that has torched his friends. In the end you're left wondering whether there wasn't some way Ryder Bond could have done more for the Frankies of this world.\"LEGACY OF TERROR\" gives you the same kind of story, but with an even more provocative twist. When Aztec priests look to bring their warrior mummy back to life, they need a willing sacrifice. Who better than a spoiled, resentful Chicano punk, briliantly played by a young (and gorgeous) Erik Estrada? It's worth noting that Estrada is fearless as an actor here. Instead of making Pepe an innocent, deluded fool, he boldly plays him as a spoiled, self-pitying punk -- getting laughs and hitting uncomfortably close to home. \"Friend, you're bending my mind off my music!\"Pepe is holed up in a luxury hotel, helping the priests choose \"perfect\" sacrifices for the mummy waiting to be reborn. A football star, a Green Beret . . . and a very demure and ladylike Air Force officer. (And some interesting feminist back and forth between the officer and the hotel's PR lady.)Kolchak really outdoes himself in this one, digging out secrets in the hotel basement and consulting a very touchy taxidermist (a hilarious cameo by theater great Sorrell Booke.) But the Kolchak and Vincenzo repartee really makes this one soar.\"First this mummy is cluttering up someone's basement and now he's marching in Macy's easter parade? Look Carl. You yourself said that the mummy disappeared. You got a terrible hit in the head and you saw things. And as for having a dummy in a key staff position . . . I'm as guilty as the next.\"MY PICK: Both these episodes are in the Kolchak top ten!!!",

    "review/text": "I was a big fan of Kolchak when it first aired, although there were some plots that to me demonstrated lameness on the part of the producers and writers. Remakes of old ghost and monster stories that have been told many times are difficult to make interesting. The episodes that I liked the most were those that used elements of non-western horror stories or relatively unknown mythology.\"Fire Fall\" uses as its' basis something that has been reported for some time, namely that under very unusual circumstances humans can spontaneously combust, burning to a crisp in a matter of seconds without severely damaging the immediate surroundings. In this episode, the victim is ignited through the actions of a Doppleganger, a murderous spirit that has taken on the image of a famous symphony conductor. Kolchak is forced to consult a female gypsy seer in order to learn how to combat the Doppleganger as his intervention has now made him a prime target. Unfortunately, his actions in conquering the Doppleganger are little more than yelling at it to \"Stop it!\"In German folklore, a Doppleganger is a ghostly double of a living person and there is some scientific evidence that it is a genuine phenomenon. By selective stimulation of patient's brains, scientists have been able to produce the impression of a Doppleganger being present. What I enjoyed about this episode is that it was based on a relatively unknown aspect of the mythology of Northern Europe.\"Legacy of Terror\" is also strong because it is based on ancient Aztec beliefs. Someone is cutting out the hearts of strong warrior types and Kolchak is on the scene when the perpetrator knocks him down and out. He regains consciousness and claims that it was a giant bird. An ancient evil Aztec god that wears a feathered costume comes back to life every fifty-two years and claims five humans as sacrifices. As was the case when the Aztec Empire was at its' height, the hearts of the victims are cut out and the people must be impeccable warriors. However, the last sacrifice must be a volunteer, he is selected and treated as a god for a year given the services of three beautiful women.\"Kolchak\" was never better than when it branched out into areas of horror that have not been well traveled. This forced the producers and writers to create more imaginary scenarios as well as give more detailed explanatory background. When the better-known plots were used, the producers tended to rely on routines based on the viewer already knowing certain things. While this is easier, it is also unexciting.",

I am not telling Tina fans not to buy this, I am simply saying that the audio from the actual concert should have been used because it is very irritating to watch a performance and the words she is sying don't completely match her lips.

    "review/text": "This DVD came out roughly 3-4 years after I got to see Tina live in New York City in 1993. This was around the time of the movie \"What's Love Got to Do With It, \" and Tina was a stunning 53 years old! Gliding across the stage for two hours in spike heels as if she were on rollerblades--something you have to see to believe--what a fireball of a show she gave that night! I have had the privilege of seeing many great performers but Tina Turner remains one of the VERY best and it's no stretch to say that it can't be topped! Then, as now, I felt that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see and enjoy a legend in her supposed \"twilight.\"I recently purchased and watched \"Wildest Dreams\" and this live show given in Amsterdam brought back the glorious memory of that incredible show at Jones Beach in NYC. The only (very slight) disappointment of the DVD is the section when Tina decides to sit and sing two or three of my all-time favorites from her: \"Let's Stay Together,\" \"Steamy Windows\" and \"Undercover Agent for the Blues.\" At Jones Beach, she performed the latter two showstoppers with her dancers--you haven't lived until you've seen her outdance two girls that could pass for her daughters in an opening stunner like \"Steamy Windows.\" Simply amazing! It's safe to say that people half her age and younger could not keep up with the manic energy, exquisite choreography and sexiness she projects. So seeing her on the DVD, performing those sizzlers while seated was a bit of a letdown--especially since she could barely contain herself even while seated! Despite this, \"Wildest Dreams\" is almost letter-perfect (No words can quite describe her electrifying performances of Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love,\" \"Do what you Do\" and her signature \"Proud Mary\" here). This DVD captures with perfect clarity the astounding prowess of one of the most generous and giving performers ever to grace any stage in ANY genre. . . .",

It was like watching it live all over again. I have worn out my DVD and will be purchasing a new one. I just saw Tina live again in Philadelphia, PA on November 29, 2008 and she still gives a performance that is phenomenal. I can only hope this most recent tour Tina gives at age 69 will be released on DVD so I can watch it at home because she is \"Simply The Best\"",

Her studio recordings have always sounded better probably because she can do them again and again until she gets them perfect. Concerts don't allow such luxuries.This DVD is available in a 5.1 surround sound version, or DTS version. I have the 5.1 surround DVD and it is more than adequate. I have to ask why the concert wasn't filmed in widescreen to give the viewer more of a feel for the concert.The DVD also includes a lengthy interview with Tina where she discusses each track of the then new album &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;.

I bought this DVD due to the great reviews it had in Amazon, and since I really love sound and was told this could test my system to the limit, I bought it.This is definitely one of the best buy decisions I made.This DVD is more than music. It's an experience. From the dynamic cameras, the music, the performance (dance and sing), the public (man, it *feels* like if you were there), everything will remind you WHY you inverted a lot of money into your system and what kind of experiences you can get out of it.The DVD is long, takes many of Tina greatest songs, performed by a 100% magnetic and inspired singer, with outstanding musicians and fantastic dancers.I always show two DVDs to people. With the first, Eagles: Hell Freezes Over DTS, people say 'This sounds really great, crystal clear'. With the second, this one, people just say 'WOW!' and start asking how much they would need to spend to buy a similar system.If you love music, specially the 5.1 experiences, this is one of those 'must-have' DVDs. Being of an indredible quality, it doesn't have the crystal clear sound of Eagles: Hell Freezes Over DTS, nor the absolute purest image quality. But it has what made many of us buy a great system: bringing a full experience into your living-room.",

    "review/text": "I caught this tour when she hit Knoxville in '97, and it was the first major concert I had ever been to. What a way to start out, huh? This DVD captures the energy and excitement of her show in a way that's fantastic! The picture is clear, the sound is SO awesome, the camera work is fantastic.The ONLY drawback to this disc is that at times you can tell audio from one show is used for video from another, so that it appears that she's lip-syncing, when Ms. Turner doesn't resort to such tricks. The show was recorded over three nights, in front of over 150,000 people, so I guess some sloppy editing work is in evidence here. This, remarkably, doesn't take anything away from her performance in this show. The lady is astounding! I can only hope and pray that I have half that much energy when I'm 56! Wow! She moves all over the stage, usually VERY energetically, and she looks SO sexy and beautiful!Her musicians and dancers deserve some good attention here, as they back her up beautifully.All her old hits are featured here, along with some new ones from her 'Wildest Dreams' disc, which I might add, is a great disc. The main highlight for me, I guess, is 'Proud Mary'. This song is coreographed and performed so perfectly, the fact that it was written by, performed first by, and belongs to Creedence Clearwater Revival never enters your head for a moment. What an amazing piece of rock-and-roll history we're treated to!All in all, please get this disc, and see what this astounding, talented LADY can do to an arena full of complete strangers: make them into adoring, thrilled friends, if only for a couple of hours on a hot night in Amsterdam.",

Due to the rapid changing of scenes, we don't get to see very much of Tina Turner. Most regrettable, because she is the best part of the show--such emotion, facial expression, gestures--a true one-woman show. Unfortunately, we miss most of that due to the poor editing.",

Frankly , I was surprised at the few negative reviews for this \"Live in Amsterdam\", I thoroughly enjoyed this one, both visually and soundwise, this was a huge improvement over \"One Last Time\".There is also much better camera work and editing on this one. Tina's raw energy and ability to hold an audience really shines through on this one, and it leaves no doubt as to what a class act she is and why she sells out arenas and stadiums, and even the guitar work and saxophone alone are worth the price of admission. I was really tempted to give this one the full five stars, but had to give it only 4 stars since my true feeling was for 4 and 1/2. The only flaw I really noticed was that Tina's voice seems to be weakening with age , which is to be expected, and I thought she had to struggle a bit in the higher ranges on a few numbers, which occasionally made her sound a bit forced, almost shouting the lyrics at times. But for the most part she gives you your money's worth , and I have no regrets about buying this one.",

    "review/text": "This DVD recorded in Amsterdam comes from Tina's Wildest Dreams tour which was a spectacular success playing over 150 concerts to some 3,000,000 people. By the time this concert was recorded everything had become so familiar to the performers - instrumentalists and dancers, that the whole event progresses with all the natural ease of breathing.The track list contains 20 of her most popular hits as well as one bonus and features her regular band who perform with totally slick professionalism as one would expect. The three dancers complement Tina with dancing of great precision. Tina herself, is the ball of energy that she always is, with a tremendous ability to communicate through her songs and with her rapturous audience.The recording is in 4:3 visual format but is clear and captures the excitement and immediacy of the event. The sound is presented in DD 5.1 and stereo. This is cut at a slightly lower level than usual so the volume needs turning up to compensate and to add body to a slightly bass-light recording.As a compilation of a considerable number of Tins's most popular hits performed at white heat this disc will be hard to beat. I would therefore expect it to be much appreciated by anyone who warms to the Tina Turner phenomenon and would suggest that this is a good 5 stars worth even allowing for the slight sound reservations as above.",

Downsides are overall mediocre sound in DTS and some poor sound editing (the concert was filmed over 3 days in Amsterdam but some audio tracks were cheated from other concerts). Still, these criticisms are minor as the overall impact is tremendous.

She so undoubtedly loves doing these shows for the adoring Dutch fans, that it becomes infectious not only to the viewer but also to her band members and dancers. Unlike some, I thought this was one of the best directed concert videos I have had the pleasure of watching. I don't care for the constant barrage of one second shots which are way too plentiful these days. Having said that, the shots do frequently vary but, at least for me, it seemed to have a nice rhythm which added rather than detracted from the level of enjoyment.Others have said it, but once again....Tina Turner fan or not, this is a must see/have concert.",

    "review/text": "I had never heard of this movie before its release on this DVD. It is a real treat for fans of Seventies horror films, in the vein of Blacula, Count Yorga, Deathmaster, or maybe even The Abominable Dr. Phibes. It sports a number of attractive women and as always focuses on the curious early 1970's attraction to the supernatural. Best of all, though, is the ubiquitous and cheerfully wicked Doctor Death! John Considine plays the part with considerable relish. The story hangs around a guy whose beloved wife has recently died and his desire to resurrect her (he is haunted by her saying, I will come back to you). After many false starts he encounters the ghoulish Dr. Death who promises to help him with his problem, and in fact won't stop once Doctor Death's usual method does not produce results, which is to kill someone else to enter the desired body. I think too much more plot would spoil the movie, but the remainder of the movie is by turns campy fun punctuated with some seriously twisted moments to keep the horror element. Other actors in this feature vary in quality, from the wooden husband to the odd and entertaining cameos by the likes of Florence Marly and Moe Howard!The print of this movie looks very nice with bright colors and no visible flaws. The sound is similarly clearly audible. The extras consist of a frankly rather boring commentary, but I don't like most commentaries, by Considine and others. The best extras are an interesting interview with Considine and trailers for other movies to be released by Scorpion. I found this movie to be great fun and highly recommend it.",

    "review/text": "This second volume of performance clips from the BBC's historically significant \"Old Grey Whistle Test\" series continues to goad and tease music geeks. When you research the (amazing!) contents of the THREE volumes already available in the UK, this latest domestic offering, like Vol 1, seems a tad timid and eager to \"play it safe\" (I can appreciate an \"eclectic\" mix, but Hall & Oates, Loggins & Messina, Jim Croce and Simply Red are better suited for the ubiquitous \"Soft Hits\" FM station in your market). There are a few more questionable choices-I love the Who, but why offer a clip of one of the world's greatest LIVE acts LIP SYNCHING thier worst single ever, \"The Relay\"? Although I am an avid Anglophile, even I could have done without Heads Hands & Feet (erm...who?!) or the in-jokey \"skiffle\" jam (would it have hurt to include the odd Alex Harvey, Gary Moore or Roy Harper clip that is available on the UK disks instead?) On the plus side, there are enough genuine \"live\" performances to balance things out. The most dynamic clip belongs to Montrose, really ripping it up with \"Bad Motor Scooter\". Another highlight-spunky pixie Carla DeVito makes such a sexy splash during an exhaustingly epic rendition of \"Paradise By The Dashboard Light\" that you'll barely notice that her boss Meat Loaf hits a lot of bad notes due to some obviously over taxed pipes. The NY Dolls are hilariously energetic, even though the deliciously sloppy \"Jet Boy\" is lip-synched (they were mostly about stage presence anyway). You'll also have a chuckle when you see the Average White Band's Hamish Stuart, sporting the biggest 'fro ever grown by a Scotsman. Some nice moments on the introspective side as well, particularly from Beach Boy Bruce Johnston, delivering a breathtaking \"Disney Girls\". An appearance by Tim Buckley (performing the lovely \"Dolphins\") will be revelatory for younger viewers when they glean the spooky parallels in physical appearance and vocal expression with his son Jeff. Punk, New Wave and mid 80's pop are covered as well, from the Adverts to Pre-Fab Sprout. A worthwhile disc (albeit frustrating) for serious music collectors.",

Sorry, but Loggins and Messina, Average White Band, Jim Croce, Hall & Oates, Thomas Dolby and Simply Red just don't match up to Bill Withers, Captain Beefheart, Talking Heads, XTC, Iggy Pop and the Specials. The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself. So there's some nice moments here, but I really don't want to own anything that includes Loggins and Messina on it.",

The Jim Croce and New York Dolls clips are wonderful and if you mocked the 1980's you will find yourself pulling out your old Stlye Council and Aztec Camera records after watching their clips.

    "review/text": "The BBC have chosen to treat OGWT as if it's run was one long homogeneous series and the selection of music a history of the show. It wasn't. It was obvious at the time and interviews from Vol 1 really confirm that it was really 2 shows... The Bob Harris era, which featured eclectic art rock in a tiny studio characterized by high quality and occasionally impenetrable musicianship and the Anne Nightingale era characterized by whatever pseudo counter culture image the major labels were promoting that year.In keeping with the fact that the BBC, when it caught on, ditched the former in favour of the latter - a lot of the real gems have turned up missing from these collections.That said, they're still pretty good and have a few magnificent performances on them. In keeping with the OGWT philosophy this is mostly about the music. The chats before each are vaguely interesting but can be skipped once you've heard them once. Scene breaks separate the music from the chats in a way which music lovers love and video producers hate. Kudos.Back to the real content. There is some good music, some disappointments, a couple of nice surprises and a couple of real gems here.Patti Smith was disappointing, singing Because the Night like she'd been moking cigars constantly for the last 3 hours and was afraid to breathe for fear of her lungs collapsing.Head Hands and Feet were a nice surprise with a neat bluesey opening number I'd never heard before.Thomas Dolby provided a great performance of Hyperactive. I liked the song but never realised how richly complex it was before seeing it performed.For me, though, the high and the low point were one and the same - Joan Armatrading, looking both astonishingly young and frighteningly mature for her age sings Love and Affection in a way that still gives me shivers when I think about it. An unbelievable amount of musical, emotional and poetic talent crammed into that one 3 minute performance. And that song alone was cut short before it finished. Other artists got to ramble the last chorus over and over while they faded out and this song they cut off the denuement. What a joy and what a travesty.The presence of that performance alone made this a 4* product but that 5-10 missing seconds cost them a star and that was a well deservered demerit.All in all a mixed bag with enough good to be worth owning both for pleasure and history.",

They also left of the performance of Stanley Clarke/George Duke Project - 'Schooldays' which was also great. While they left off these great performances they left on Judee Sill?! Who the heck EVER heard of her in America?!!!There are some good performances on this disc but to leave off some of the best ones TO FIT IN USELESS BRITISH TV ADVERTISING is a crime.I recommend skipping this version of this DVD and getting the British version if your DVD player can play PAL DVD's. That way you get ALL the performances that were originally on this compilation. I wonder when they release disc 3 are they going to leave off Robin Trower? That's right folks, Robin Trower is on Disc 3 but we'll probably never see it here in America so they can fit in more BBC advertising. FRIGGIN' IDIOTS!!!!",

    "review/text": "Republic Pictures presents \"NEW FRONTIER\" (10 August 1939) (57 mins/B&W;) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- The series was based on a series of western novels by William Colt MacDonald, which began with \"Law of the .45's\" in 1933 --- The Three Mesquiteers is the umbrella title for a series of 51 western B-movies released between 1936 and 1943, including 8 films starring John Wayne --- The name was a play on The Three Musketeers, and each film featured a trio of stars --- The series blended the traditional Western period with more modern elements, which was not unknown with other B-Western films and serials --- Towards the end of the series, during World War II, the trio of cowboys were opposing Nazis --- The Three Mesquiteers series was extremely popular at the time of its release --- The series was the only one of its kind to be specifically named and ranked in contemporary polls of the top western film stars --- For example, from 1937 to the end of the series in 1943, The Motion Picture Herald consistently ranked the series in its top ten, reaching a peak of 5th place in 1938, when a pre-Stagecoach John Wayne was the series leadUnder the production staff of:George Sherman - DirectorWilliam A. Berke - ProducerBetty Burbridge - ScreenwriterLuci Ward - ScreenwriterReggie Lanning - CinematographerWilliam Lava - Composer (Music Score)Tony Martinelli - EditorOur story line and plot, Our heroes Stony Brooke (John Wayne), Tucson Smith (Ray \"Crash\" Corrigan) and Rusty Joslin (Raymond Hatton) members of the Three Mesquiteers convince a group of settlers to exchange their present property for some which, unbeknownst to our goodguys, is going to be worthless --- They are captured before they can warn the ranchers --- When the New Hope Valley ranchers learn their land has been condemned for construction of a new dam, they decide to fight --- When they delay the construction, Proctor suggests they relocate in a desert valley that will be irrigated by a new pipeline --- The dam is then completed but when the Mesquiteers check on the site, they see there was no intention of building a pipeline --- first attempt at film stardom for Phyllis Isley, age 20 at the time, whose name was changed in 1942 to the better known, Jennifer Jones, at the request of David O. Selznick, her mentor and later husband --- John Wayne said farewell to the Three Mesquiteers film series and to the character of Stoney Burke he had played in them. The Mesquiteers would continue on without the Duke as they had before him. Herbert J. Yates and Republic finally decided that Wayne had become too big a star to continue him in B westerns. His next film after this was a loan out to RKO, Allegheny Uprising --- In fact there was another change in the cast, Max Terhune left the series even before this and was replaced by Raymond Hatton.the cast includes:John Wayne ... Stony BrookeRay Corrigan ... Tucson SmithRaymond Hatton ... Rusty JoslinJennifer Jones ... Celia Braddock (as Phylis Isley)Eddy Waller ... Major Steven BraddockSammy McKim ... Stevie BraddockLeRoy Mason ... M.C. GilbertHarrison Greene ... William ProctorReginald Barlow ... Judge Bill LawsonBurr Caruth ... Dr. William 'Doc' HallDave O'Brien ... Jason BraddockHal Price ... SheriffJack Ingram ... Henchman HarmonBud Osborne ... Henchman DicksonSlim Whitaker ... Rancher Jed Turner (as Charles Whitaker)Bob Burns ... Jailed RancherFred Burns ... Fiddle PlayerGeorge Chesebro ... DeputySpecial footnote -- The 32 year old John Wayne was fortunate enough to have talented writers around him to write novels that could be adapted into vehicles for his career, as well as short stories and screenplays that would immortalise him as the American hero --- This film is one such example --- When you watch this film you're not watching it for the story (like you would do in 'Rio Grande' or 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'), you're watching it to see John Wayne in action --- He is the romantic embodiment of what it was like for the settling community to live in the post-civil war era --- Despite the fact that most of these westerns distort history, what Wayne delivers gives you access to his humanity --- That's what we like about him.BIOS:1.

    "review/text": "John Wayne, Ray Corrigan and Raymond Hatton are one of the best trigger trios ever namely the Three Mesquiteers. The print is good and sharp and there are lots of riding, fighting and shooting. Some seconds of the action and stunts are fill-ins from older movies and that's a bit irritating but one can live with it. It is always a pleasure to see great actors like Leroy Mason, Eddy Waller, Jack Ingram and many more. Billed under her real name Phyllis Isley, you are witness to the film debut of Jennifer Jones. And then it is a bit funny to think that this b-western is from the same year that Wayne starred in John Ford's Stagecoach.",

Watching them ride will inspire all of you mountain biking enthusiast out there. As the description states, this is about the riders and sacrifices they go through, not about their riding skill and extreme stunts. I expected non-stop action, but this is still a great DVD to add to my collection. I've watched it a few times just to watch them ride their riding chapters.A must buy for anyone serious about competitive DH racing. Shred it up all!",

    "review/text": "This video is a documentary of The Animals and Eric Burdon's bands after the Animals broke up, up to and including War.There are quite a few interesting interviews and commentary but all the music contained herein is all just short clips.At least they mostly interview people relevant to the story, mostly Eric Burdon in a really laid back way. There are also interview clips with Chas Chandler, Alan Price, etc., but the appearances of Sammy Hagar is awkward & out of place. I guess since he says he saw them at Monterey it has some relevance.Very interesting stories about the Animals days, especially touring England on one bus with Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry, who apparently were not very compatible touring partners, to put it nicely. That story is a hoot. Also who knew that \"House Of The Rising Sun\" was done in one take, and their management (Michael Jeffries of Jimi Hendrix fame)and producer Mickey Most resisted even doing it. The story about Eric meeting Nina Simone was also very interesting. Interesting views about Jimi Hendrix, too, of whom Eric was supposedly a good friend of.You could tell that early R&R; management, producers, touring, etc. took its toll on musicians, even when they were strong and young. The Animals just got screwed from the get-go. No wonder why they didn't last.All in all, a good documentary for Animals, Eric Burdon (and the Animals), and War fans. My main gripes are a lack of identification of people being interviewed (at least do it on their first appearance), and music clips that only last a minute or two. Come on documentary makers, many of us want to see the ENTIRE song, not just a short clip. At least make it a menu item to watch the entire performances separately, if possible. Warning - if you must have a performance clip of the song \"Sky Pilot\", it does NOT appear here.Sound quality varies (stereo and mono) but is acceptable considering the sources.",

He raves about the Animals and then later the he raves about the \"New Animals\" like the first band was actually second rate, but this new band can really play. Hagar seems to be under the impression this documentary is about him...I mean, like \"oh I came from a small town in Montana that was a lot like Newcastle...give me a break Sammy- go back to Anaconda and stay there.

So, this is a real treat for Glenn Gould fans to hear \"new\" recordings.He stopped giving concerts in 1964.

These are complete programs, so you get to marvel not only at the transcendent performances but at the ease with which Gould enters into, say, a Bach fugue, whether for a few measures or for the entire piece, and then reemerges to deliver some extraordinary insight in a mannered but impeccable spoken prose...

    "review/text": "Although the book version of the Odyssey was capturing, the movie was rather disappointing because they left out quite a few scenes and changed the story a bit in some parts, which made it rather dull.The movie begins as Odysseus son, Telemachus, Alan Stenson, is being born. Soon afterwards, he is drafted into the Trojan War for 11 years. He thinks he defeated the Trojans because of his crafty idea. However this angers the gods and curses his voyage home. Odysseus, Armand Assante, and his crew face many difficult trials and are away from home for almost 20 years. When they finally return, many suitors are trying to marry his faithful wife, Penelope, Greta Scacchi, and take over his land. Odysseus eventually reclaims his family and pride.The book and movie versions of the Odyssey are similar in some ways. For example the war at Troy, the cursed voyage, the Cyclops encounter, detainment on Circe's Island, the sea monsters, and Odysseus final return to Ithaca, his home, to drive away the suitors are in both the book and movie.However, there are quite a few differences, or things they left as well. For example, while on his way to free his men from Circe, Hermes tells him he will lay with her before hand, but leaves out that he should make her promise not to play any tricks on him. In addition, Circe does not warn Odysseus of the monsters or sirens. (Or what to do when facing them.) However, when Odysseus enters the underworld as commanded by Circe, a dead prophet warns him of only the 6-headed monster. After speaking with the prophet, Odysseus does not return to Circe as he did in the book, but goes on to face the monsters. Odysseus and his crew don't pass the sirens in the movie and while facing the six-headed monster, offer a goat as a sacrifice and everyone but Odysseus is lost to it. In the book, the men are killed by Zeus because they at the cattle of Helios, the sun god. One of the final differences is at the very end. The book gives a deep description of Odysseus getting rid of his maidservants for not being loyal and laying with the suitors. However, the movie leaves this out.I believe the differences overrule the similarities and are pretty much the same as the good and bad qualities of the movie. The good things are the similarities, and the bad are the differences. My recommendation is to read the Odyssey because it is a good book with very detailed descriptions of the characters and adventures made. However, the movie should be viewed only if there is nothing else to watch or it is part of an assignment.",

Many minor discrepancies and a few major flaws detract from the usefulness of the movie both as a teaching material and as a visual guide for the book.If you just want an enjoyable movie that is loosely related to a classic work, then this movie is great.

It all stars out with the war. Odysseus is sent off to the war when his sun is being born. He fights for 10 years and at the end of the war Odysseus and his men build a hollow horse and get in it and some other men take it to there enemy's castle. At night they get out of the horse and fight. Then odysseus leaves with his men and makes the gods mad at him by saying they cannot stop him. So he goes through alot of trouble trying to get home. But some people help him like the god of the wind Aeolus but soon trouble comes again. One of Odysseuses men opens the bag and blows them to a far off land. Monsters evenchuly kill all of Odysseuses men. He comes to the island of Colypso and was there for 2 years on tell Zeus told a messenger to tell calypso to let Odysseus go or the island would be sunk to the bottom of the ocean. So calypso lets him go and when he finally gets home hera turns him into a old man and only his sun can see him young. Ponelapy gets some men to set up 12 axes with rings at the end of each handle that only Odysseus could shoot an arrow through. When Odysseus shoots the arrow through the 12 rings he turns back to his age he was before. I think this was a very good movie and my favorite character is Odysseus.",

No such luck, like Odysseus, I tried hard to get to finish what I had started, but to no avail. It has now been almost a year. My husband has given up as we endlessly search every video shop, every library, and every outlet where it can be bought. We are told it has been withdrawn from Britain, and no other outlet seems to use the P.A.L format. Somebody please help. It is one of the most magnificent films I have ever seen and would go so far as to say that watching it was a life altering experience. If one looks beyond the storyline and the basic plot and begins to understand the more subtle themes, then it truely warrants full exposure. I am a classical studies undergraduate at Keele university, England and watching this film did not only give me personal pleasure, it fulfilled the aim of contributing to my knowledge of this wonderful epic poem. I am convinced this is one of the best interpretations of this poem ever made and I am equally convinced that Homer would have been 'most proud'.",

Even the classic scene involving Argos the dog was ommitted from this modern creation. Ugh!On the flip side, Athena's portrayal by Isabella Rossellini and the actor playing the god Mercury are very fun to watch in &quot;The Odyssesy&quot;. Still...not enough to do the story justice.",

    "review/text": "This movie, THE ODYSSEY was really good and educational. This movie was based on the epic poem written by Homer. This movie had lots of action and suspense. My favorite scene was on Calypso's island. Calypso hadn't seen a man in a long time, and she tried her hardest to keep Odysseus on her island. But Zeus stepped in and made Calypso turn Odysseus free. My favorite characters were Telemachus, Achilles, Odysseus, and Calypso. Telemachus, the son of Odysseus, was very brave and never gave up hope that his father was still alive. Achilles, a great war hero, couldn't be killed unless he was cut on his ankle. Odysseus, king of Ithica, helped defeat Troy and made it back home safely. Calypso was my all time favorite. This is probably because she is the best looking character in the movie. Another thing I liked about this movie was its historical background. The tunics that they wore were the same as the Greeks of that time wore. They also showed the olive pressing which was a big part of Greek life back then. The display of Social customs also had some historic background. If you went to visit another kingdom you would bring gifts, and receive a place to stay and a feast. Lastly, they showed the geography of Greece. They showed the mountainous and hilly terrain of ancient Greece. Overall, I think this movie was a great, and I would recommend it to everyone.",

The way the monsters looked and moved was so life like it was scary. The monsters were not the only thing that were life like. The gateway to the under world was so cool looking. I think it was cool how they had the lava river down there. One of my favorite parts in this movie was when Achilles through the spear at Hector. My most favorite part is when they were in the cave with the three headed monster, and the monster kept eating Odysseus's men. My favorite character was Aeolus god of the wind. Aeolus was a small bald headed man that wanted to help Odysseus and his men come home. The worst part of this movie was when they saw their home land Ithaca but the crew of Odysseus opened the bag of bad wind and they were blown off to another island. This movie was a little hard to understand and it was hard to keep up with the plot because of all the places they went. Another character that I thought was cool was Telemachus, He was the son of the mighty Odysseus. Telemachus wanted to find his father so when he was 17 he went to Sparta to ask the king where his father was. The King of Sparta told Telemachus the his father was dead. Telemachus returned home not knowing that his father had returned while he was gone. Then after they were united Athena turned Telemachus into an old man so no one would him. Then Telemachus and Odysseus planned a way to get the men out of his house. The maid's locked the men in a room alone with Telemachus and Odysseus and well there was a bloody battle.Odysseus returned to his normal self again and ruled his kingdom forever.This movie is a historical fiction movie, Some facts were real others were amazingly off. Some things that I saw in this movie ,maded me believe that they were back in ancient Greece times, while others looked so fake \"I could see the strings(expression).\" This movie had it's up's and down's but every movie does that is what makes a great movie.The End",

    "review/text": "i was pretty excited when i saw they made a movie out of the myth. and like most myths made into movies, they ruined it. Odysseus does not leave for war the same day his son is born, his son is crawling when they come for him and he feigns madness by sowing his fields with salt. Telemachus is placed before him CRAWLING, and that is how it is revealed that he is not mad. babies don't crawl their first day. also Penelope is a lot younger than him, yet in the movie the actress portraying her has crow's feet and noticeable wrinkles. she was a child bride as was the custom in those days. Odysseus does not appear to rule a kingdom in the movie, rather he seems to be reigning over an overlarge farm. the gods and goddesses are possessed of terrible beauty, only Callisto(Vanessa Williams) fits the bill. Athena is a tall blond grey eyed beautiful warrior goddess clad in armor, not a homely short brunette with green eyes dressed like a housewife. Odysseus's men are a joke. Hermes has his beauty but appears to be floating about in a diaper. the \"ship\" is yacht sized. Circe the goddess is just as homely as Athena. and when Odysseus finally returns his wife was supposed to test him with a comment that she had moved the bed(built on the tree), to see if he is not an impostor, not swoon and faint into his arms.and where were the Sirens...?",

Thousands of years later, when TVs are in existence, we fail at telling the same story with his exuberance. The motion picture depiction of Homer's work is a lame collection of attempted action scenes that does nothing to keep the watcher entertained throughout this movie. The human characters along with those mythical creatures they encounter respond to events without using common sense that anyone with half a brain would use. Despite all that, assuming the plot and the logic of the characters entertained you enough to keep your eyes open during the movie, you'd realize how all the actors seem undecided on what accent to use or even how to pronounce the names of the others...",

For an example, the (quoted from the Odyssey) &quot;red haired king Menelaos,&quot; doesn't have red hair. I understand that Menelaos wants to make a fashion statement, but lets stick to the storyline, eh?Other than that, Telemachos' mighty double spear throw-that-never-was, though not accurate, as was mentioned earlier, has made Telemachos a laughingstock at our school.

    "review/summary": "Overall, pretty well done",
    "review/text": "This film can be broken up into 3 parts. The first 2 parts detail scenes from Homer's ILIAD and Virgil's AENEID. The 3rd part, as is likely surmised, covers stories taken from Homer's ODYSSEY. The latter comprises 90% of the film.The weakest part of the film is early section of ILIAD material. For one, the actor who plays Achilles is simply not big enough or brawny enough to be believable as what was supposed to be the greatest warrior who ever lived. Even worse, his showdown with the Trojan champion Hector (one of the climactic scenes from the ILIAD) is sadly disappointing. It would have been better to omit this episode altogether rather than water it down as much as they did.As a minor criticism, it is unfortunate that the audience of the film is never told WHY all of Greece went to war with Troy. No mention is made of Paris' abduction of Helen of Laconia. The movie makes it seem like the Greeks one day just got up and arbitrarily decided to invade Troy. The Trojan's violation of Xenia is not divulged as a just reason for the actions of the Greeks.Those criticisms aside, the rest of the movie is splendid, for the most part. The episode of the Trojan horse (from the AENEID) is well done and follows Virgil fairly closely. The TELEMACHIA is touched on with brevity, but it is included. And, of course, Odysseus' famous adventures in &quot;la la land&quot; are there for all to see.Armand Assante is a good pick as the clever and sagacious king of Ithica. He is a great warrior, but not the best. He's a man who tends to rely much more on insidious cunning than brute strength. His feud with Poseidon is brought out nicely, and the depiction of Poseidon is very impressive.This film is highly recommended for those who have read Homer, those who have not read Homer &amp; those who've not yet read the Greek bard, but someday want. The special effects on the DVD are dazzling &amp; bring Greek mythology to life (particularly the Underworld sequence). The epic poem is recommended to all as well. However, if you don't ever get around to reading it, this film does do a credible job of capturing some of the flavor and magic of a classic work that is over 2,500 years old.",

    "review/text": "The OdysseyI think that this was a very cool movie! At first I was kind of doubtful, because lots of times school movies are pretty boring. But between the great costumes, cast, and special effects, this reinactment of Homer's Odyssey was great. The cast was awesome, including some very well-known actresses like Vanessa Williams and Bernadette Peters. This movie has something for everyone. If you like blood and gore, or if you like adventure, or if you like romance, this video has it all. This movie starts out with Odysseus' son being born and him leaving Ithaca to fight the Trogan War. After the war, Odysseus is cursed by Poseidon, who swears Odysseus will never get home. On the way back to Ithaca, Odysseus encounters many gods, goddesses, and mythical creatures, such as the Cyclops and the Scylla. Many of him men were killed on the long journey home. While he was away, lots of men tried to marry his wife Penelope, but she was faithful to her husband. When Ithaca's hero and king returns home, everything has a very happy ending. This video also tells a great deal about the true history of Greece during this time period. Olive farming and pressing was mentioned, the attire of the men (tunics) was also shown. Also, the citizens of Greece and it's hilly, unfertile ground were portrayed realistically, being herders, sailors, and warriors. Also, the religion of early Greece also played a big part in this story. For example, Athena was always watching over Odysseus, who feared Poseidon because of the curse. Another custom was to sacrifice goats and other animals to the gods and to always bring a gift to your host. All in all, I really liked this movie. I think you will too!",

If I would have read the translated story in a book, I really wouldn't understand the story at all. Odysseus has great preserverence. HIs family has even more, considering the fact that after 7 years of war and 10 more years after that, they still believe Odysseus will return. Penelope, (Greta Scacchi) Odysseus' wife, never gave up on Odysseus, and kept the promise he asked of her the day he left for war. Telemachus (Alan Stenson) did his best in walking in his father's footsteps. It was hard to name Odysseus as the only protaganist, because Penelope was also a main character. After viewing this movie, I have a better understanding of why the writer Homer would write a poem about the adventures of Odysseus. I have a better understanding of why the greeks had polytheism. In the movie, it shows how strong polytheisn was. When Odysseus' son, Telemachus is born, he shouts out, \"The the gods and Penelope. . .\" . During the movie Athena (Isabella Rosellini) appears to give Odysseus and Penelope her wisdom. The movie also shows how olives were pressed for olive oil in those days. I thought that was pretty interesting , knowing that the Greeks used olives in practically all their food. Overall, The Odyssey was a unit on Greece all by itself.",

    "review/text": "Well I just finished watching this movie in school, after reading the poem. Most literature-based films are cheesy, and this one is slightly cheesy, but the special effects were amazing. The Cyclops especially looked real, and pretty gross. Of course, nothing can compare to the original poem by Homer, but the film actually lets you see all the action and emotion. Speaking of emotion, the film has very good actors, especially the guy who played the adult Telemachus. That's another thing. In the movie I saw more of Telemachus and Penelope, and how they were and stuff, because when we read the poem we didn't read all of it. There were some things in the movie, though, that weren't in the poem. For example, in the poem Telemachus never fought one of the suitors, and the suitors didn't burn Penelope's shroud. But the film was pretty historically accurate. I didn't know, however, that women had to cover their faces when they spoke to men (or in public?). Because at one point in the movie, Penelope speaks to all the suitors with a cloth covering her face, and they ridicule and are rude to her. But when she drops it, they become silent and seemingly shocked. Hmm. Overall, it was an excellent film. It was a bit bloody, but I suppose that's why it's rated PG-13. If this was done with an all-star cast by a well-known director, it probably would have become a huge hit.",

Like the tunic, all the dresses, and the armor. The casting by the actors made you think that you were watching the real thing. My favorite character in the movie is Michael Pollard who played Aeolus the god of wind. During the movie they started new adventures as soon as the finished one. The movie is pretty good but is slow in some parts. After a slow part it picked back up into an action scene. It is also more historical than entertainment. They had to press the wine, sacrifice goats, heard goats, fish, make weapons, and several other things. So in conclusion I give The Odyssey four stars",

    "review/text": "This review is for the video. There are two versions of the mini-series on DVD. As recently as three years ago it was not on region 1 for American viewers.Armand Assante is Odysseus. No offense to Sean Bean (A Great Actor In His Own Right), but I could not see him as Odysseus in the film Troy. How I wish they had again recast Assante (Assuming He Would Have Wanted To Reprise The Role). Assante carries this mini-series, and although 10 years older than Bean is (And A Little Heavier & More Muscular), he more than backs up the part of Odysseus.This mini-series concentrates very little on the events of the Trojan War itself. Instead it showcases Odysseus's long voyage home to Ithaca (For The war With Troy See: Troy & Helen Of Troy). Odysseus has insulted Poseidon, the God of the sea. As a result, his journey is wracked by journey and hardship. Along the way he encounters Cyclops and a beautiful witch that changes his men into animals. Odysseus overcomes these travails and in the depths of Hades, discovers the route home from Tiresius (Played Wonderfully By Christopher Lee), only to have his ship and crew destroyed by monsters and a steep waterfall.Saved by Calypso (Played By The Gorgeous Vanessa Williams), a beautiful nymph on the Island of Ogygia, Odysseus spends several years having blissful sex with her and her handmaidens. However, his captivity ends when Hermes, messenger of the Gods, tells Calypso Zeus orders her to send Odysseus home.Odysseus sets out on the sea in a makeshift raft, but again encounters the turbulent sea and a wrathful Poseidon. The scolding he receives from Poseidon shows Odysseus that he is indeed but a mortal. Odysseus now realizes how much in fact he needs the Gods. After his makeshift boat disentegrates on the choppy ocean, Poseidon lets Odysseus know who the Gods are and who the mortals are. Poseidon is the God while Odysseus is a mere mortal. This is a painful lesson he has to learn. The next day, half dead, he is washed ashore and by way of Phaecian traders, returned to Ithaca.Once in Ithaca, Athena puts a shroud disguise disguise over Odysseus, making him recognizable only to his son Telemachus and a trusty servant.Now at his homstead he sees those who would steal his land and wife from him. He tricks them into a large room and mercilessly slays them all. The mini-series ends shortly thereafter.Yes, I know there are big batches of the poem that are left out. Nevertheless, you must remember that they had to edit down the poem for broadcast in order for us to have a four hour mini-series. I had no problem with the format. I honestly liked this production because it held my interest throughout. It was better than Jason & the Argonauts of 2000.I liked the supporting cast members too. Christopher Lee, Eric Roberts, Greta Scacchi Bernadette Peters, Isabella Rosallini and Vanessa Williams were all inredible. The special effects were quite solid for a TV mini-series. I have no complaints from that realm. Unfortunately the bloodshed shocked me. I know it is based on the poem itself, yet I was still unnerved. This scene was unsettling to me. Odysseus showed no mercy to those who had been at the very least rude and crude in his household and at the very worst callous and cruel. \"We did not kill anybody,\" (Eric Robert's Character Said). Indeed, their actions had been affirmed by the Ithaca Assembly. Was Odysseus right in slaying them all? I think not. No doubt some should have been condemned to the collar, but wholesale slaughter? Nien, no and nyet! He showed no mercy to those helpless men.I plan to buy this on DVD when I have the opportunity. This is revised from a 2/14/13 review I made and is the most updated. It is the 75th Four Star review and the 243rd overall review; overall I give the production a Four and a Half Star rating.A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.",

    "review/text": "Morgan Campbell Goochland V.a 8th Grade 01/03/2k1 The Odyssey was a great movie. It was like the first educational movie I ever like. It was about this guy name Odysseus who got called to a war called the Trojan War. He was called to this war the same day his son was born. Ten years later he though of the idea of the Trojan horse which ended the war. This movie was not about him fighting in the Trojan war is about his journey trying to get back to his island Ithaca, and he also wanted to get home to his wife Penelope, and his son Telemachus. On his journey he ran into many gods. Some where good gods and some where bad gods. He had a guardian god named Athene. He also had a god that who made is journey twice as hard his name was Poseidon. He had a lot of different adventures hard and easy on his way back to Ithaca. But he finally made it but when he first got there he didn't go strait to his wife. The God Athens turned Odysseus into a old poor man. So Odysseus went into Ithaca and he told his son about it. So they had all the men try to do a test to when Odysseus wife. None of them could get the bow and arrow stringed or throw the 12 axes. So Odysseus in his descries stood up and stringed the bow and arrow and but the arrow throw the 12 axes. Then that turned him back into Odysseus. Then him and his son killed all he guys in that room for betrayding him. I would courage you to see this movie if you where learning about the Odyssey. It is a very good movie.",

    "review/text": "I previously watched the movie The Odyssey. The Odyssey is a story written about a man named Odysseus. This story was written by Homer a Greek writer. Odysseus was played by Armand Assante, I think he did a great job. After the Illiad the first epic by Homer The Odyssey starts. The Illiad is about Odysseus fighting in the Trojan War. In the Odyssey, Odysseus upsets the god Poseidon (Miles Anderson). Poseidon tells Odysseus that he wont make it home for a longtime. On Odysseuss journey home he encounters many creatures &amp; people. He meets one of Cyclops (Reid Asato .) Aeolus then gave Odysseus a sack of wind. When they had Ithaca in their sights one of the men opened the sack of wind and it blew far away from Ithaca. As Telemachus gets older his mother has to be wed another man. Athena tells Odysseus that she can change him into an old beggar. Then only Telemachus could know who he was. When he comes into the town of Ithaca he sees that the men have destroyed his town. His son had grown his beard so he had to enter the ring. He fought one of the men wanting to marry Penelope. Then she decides to make a challenge for the men to find out who will marry her. The man who can string Odysseuss bow and shoot it through the axe handles would win her hand in marriage. It seemed impossible to the men, then the old man strung it and shoot it perfect.This movie was historically correct in a couple of ways. The characters wore tunics made of wool. The people were fishermen, herders, and warriors. As they did in real life the people believed in many gods, and believed in sacrificing animals. The people grew olive and the woman pressed them. It took place in Ancient Greece. As it was believed in Ancient Greece you must bring presents to the persons they are visiting. The hostess was expected to board and lodge them. This movie was a good action packed thriller.",

I wouldn't thought of that in a million years.The mountains in greece is rockyand the and the land was, too.They ate flat bread and the palace was open with all the animals inside it.They grew olives and made oils from it. Then Odysseus thinks that he was so clever that he could live with out the gods. So when Poseidon hears it, he cursed him so he couldn't see his home land for many years. While he is trying to get home, he meets some interesting people and islands like the Cyclopes and he out smarts it. Next he lands on another island of aeolos ,the wind god, and he tries to help him, but one of his men opens the bag and let all the wind out. Lands on the island of Circe and stays with her for five years, while he thinks it is five days. Then he goes to the underworld to find a blind prophet, sees his mother,and leaves. Meets the two creatures, one is a five headed hydra and the other is a gigantic mouth underwater. That's how the rest of his crew dies. Then lands on another island and there he meets Calypso. Stays two years ,when he leaves he sees Poseidon and he \"broke\" him, then he can sail homewards.Now he lands on another island and the king of that island helps him by getting him a boat. Sails home,and sees his son, goes home, fix the contest. And the rest is history. That's is what I like the most about the story.",

    "review/text": "I teach Homer's \"The Odyssey\" to high school students, and I also teach at Rutgers University in the Modern Greek Studies Program. Using this movie as a teaching aid to the reading of Homer's epic story is frustrating. There are countless errors between the epic and the movie. Apparently, those that worked on the script of this film thought they could improve upon an epic piece of literature that has stood the test of time for 3000 years. What arrogance! I used this film to have discussions with my students about why they thought the film makers changed so many things from the book. It is appalling to see how erroneous this film is from Homer's glorious epic. For example, Anticleia, the mother of Odysseus, is depicted as committing suicide in the film. The book says she died from her sorrow of waiting for Odysseus' return. The scene with Telemachos, Odysseus' son, visiting King Menelaos in Sparta in the film has Menelaos telling Telemachos that his father is dead and that he should go home. In the book, Telemachos finds out from Menelaos that his father is alive and held as a prisoner on Calypso's island. Telemachos also does not go home from Sparta until the goddess Athena goes to Sparta to tell him to go home in Book 15. In the slaughter of the suitors scene in the film, Telemachos kills the suitor Antinoos first. No! Odysseus kills Antinoos first. Also, during the slaughter of the suitors, Penelope is upstairs sleeping in the book, but in the film she is awake waiting in another room. These are just four examples of many from a film that deviates blatantly from the original. Anyone who gives this film a high rating simply does not know the Odyssey epic well enough to realize just how horrendously inaccurate this movie is. It is a shame that with all the special effects and the talented actors and actresses in this film (including the great Irene Papas) that the film fails so miserably.",

This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster. It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey.

There were too many hard names to remember between the names of the people and all the different Gods. Odeseus went off to fight for ten years right after his son was born. He didnt return until his son was a young man. He fought in the Trojan War. They hid the Trojan horse and when the enemy was drunk they left the horse and killed their enemy. Odesseus told the Gods that man had defeated the enemy without the help of the Gods. The Gods told Odesseus he would be punished and not able to go home he didnt give the Gods their credit for the war. When Odesseus was sailing back to Ithica the Gods created a huge storm and blew him further out to sea. He and his crew met with many adventures and he did not return to Ithica until his son was much older. When he did return home he had to fight the men who had tried to take over his kingdom.",

Full of wonderful special effects, gorgeous Mediterranean vistas, and gods and goddesses who look their parts, this movie is still driven by personalities. The casting was brilliant: Armand Asante is all that one could wish in an Odysseus -- engaging, passionate, mature, heroic in every dimension. Isabella Rosellini and Greta Saachi are perfect in their roles as Athena and Penelope, respectively. Telemachus is a classical adolescent only child, and Antichea, Odysseus's mother, dominates each of her scenes. While this production is eye-candy from beginning to end, the visual appeal cannot distract from the timeless humanity of its characters. There is a reason that Homer's story still reaches us after 3000 years, and this telling does justice to its ancient material.",

One reason why I thought it was interesting was because all of it's historical facts. My favorite character was Cyclops. I liked him the most because they made him look so lifelike. Cyclops was a mythological creature. The Cyclops and Nymphs where the sons of Poseidon god of the sea. This movie was about a man named Odysseus that left his home to to fight a war (Trojan War) the day his son was born. He won the war and started to embark on his journey home. It took him many years but he finally made it home. I liked this movie a lot like I said I would recommend this movie for anyone that is interested in Greeks, or someone who just wants to see a wonderful movie. Some interesting things that I learned from this movie that I didn't know before was that I didn't know that the Greeks ate with their hands I thought they used silverware or something like that. Another intersecting thing about this movie was their clothes. The actors costumes looked really realistic. All of the clothes that I have seen before that the Greeks wore looked almost exactly like the ones in the movie. Most of the transportation that they used in the movie was boats. And that is a fact because most of the transportation back then was boats. The place that they filmed the movie was in the original place that it came from (Ethica). It was so awesome because you where seeing the place where it was supposed to happen.Jonathan Beigle",

    "review/text": "What happens when mankind begins to look within himself for guidance and the meaning of life rather than outwardly towards some personification of divinity or abstract supernatural power?This is the authentic journey of adventure and discovery awaiting Odysseus in this excellent made for television mini-series. It's not the epic wars of men, nor the destructive natural forces with which he must contend. It's not even the capricious whims of the Gods, Goddesses and assorted monsters populating the mythical landscape of ancient Greece and the surrounding Mediterranean. They are all nothing more than the externalization of ongoing internal processes yet to be resolved within the human soul.When Odysseus, King of Ithica sails off to war he does so with more in mind than just honoring a treaty between kings. He is seeking something more personal and lasting, he is in search of immortality. Greatness in battle was to be the vehicle by which he hoped to achieve this goal. Endeavoring to prove himself to be a God among men, he hoped to so impress the Gods of Olympus with feats of valor that he would be accepted into their eternal company.However when the God's turn on Odysseus for his hubris he becomes angry and begins to re-evaluate man's need for Gods' at all. As he struggles for the next ten years to find his way back to his wife Penelope and son he slowly begins to see through lifes' veil of illusion and eventually discovers that his path to eternal life was waiting for him back in Ithica all along. True immortality is found only within familial love and the continuation of that part of yourself that lives on in your sons and daughters. When he finally makes it home he must face one last threat to ensure the perpetuation of his legacy.The special effects are extremely well done, specially for a made-for-television production and the Mediterranean scenery is absolutely breathtaking. My two favorite sequences in the film are the ghostly vision of Hades counterbalanced by the incredibly beautiful Isle of Calypso. Armand Assante is fantastic as the brave, yet introspective Odysseus and Greta Scacchi is perfect for the part of the beautiful, long suffering Penelope. What really sets this movie apart and makes it so special is Director Andrei Konchalovsky's ability to give the viewer more than just a classic action/adventure. He delivers an insightful examination into the soul of the mythic Odysseus as he searches for the true meaning of life.",

    "review/text": "This is a film I show each year to my seventh-grade social studies students in 'Ancient Civilizations' class. Of course, parts of the Vanessa Williams sequence must be edited, but for the most part--this film is true to the Homeric epic, and is tons of fun to watch!The cast is superb--it would be hard to single out one weak link. Vincenzo Nicoli (Antinous) has to be one of the most underrated villians of all time. Just as he portrayed Simeon--the hateful brother in 'Joseph', he seeths with anger that makes the homecoming of Odysseus one of the best (and bloodiest!) climaxes to date! The special effects are excellent--especially Poseidon, and the vortex Carybdis. This creation was years ahead of Titanic, to which it will surely be compared, as will the goat scene to Jurassic Park.All in all, Homer would be proud of this film. The Trojan War scene, and Achilles versus Hector sequence are awesome, and the final reunion scene between Odysseus and Penelope will stir all but the romanticly dead!Much research must've gone into this film. There are nuances of the ancient Greek world that few will notice, such as the spirits in the underworld who are forced to wander, having been unburied, and the incredible hospitality which ancient Greeks showed guests in their homes.I would have loved to have seen Charon the ferryman of the Styx however, or perhaps Cerberus the three-headed dog, but this is a minor complaint. My students loved this film, and congratulations are in order to the producers.The Odyssey far surpasses earlier attempts of this genre, and is infinitely superior to 'Merlin'. But behind the storyline and special effects is the lesson, and it is a good one--for Odysseus and for us: Man is nothing without the suffering which humbles him, and causes him to realize that at his best, he is but a small part of an eternal 'whole'. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

It's about Odysseus the hero of the Trojan war and his journey home after upsetting the god Poseidon while he was bragging about winning the war, on his own. It follows the homerepic poem The Oddysey. I enjoyed learning about the subject in a modern way instead of some movies I have seen in black and white about the topic. One of my favorite characters is Athene because she is so mysterious and you never know when she will appear. The actors were really good especially Alan Stenson who plays Telemachus (Odysseus's son). I also liked the special affects! They would have been much better except all of the scenes were really bloody and gory! My favorite part of the movie was near the end when as a test Penelope (Odysseus' wife) gave her husband's bow and told whichever of her suitors strung the bow and shot an arrow through the holes in line of axes she would marry him. Then Odysseus disguised as an old man passes the test and turns back into his normal self. All in all this was a great movie and I reccomend it to anyone looking for a more interesting way to educate themselves about Homer's epic poem the Odyssey",

    "review/text": "This particular film adaptation of Homer's epic poem, staring Armand Assante as Odysseus, and produced by Francis Ford Coppola, from the studios of Hallmark Entertainment, is more than likely the best film rendition of this grand story.King of Ithaca, Odysseus, is asked to join the Greek forces to recover the kidnapped Princes Helen, (whose face launched a thousand ships), and masterminded the famous Trojan Horse leading to the Greek victory. Odysseus thus leaves Troy to return to his kingdom but is thwarted at every turn, punished by the god Poseidon, taking ten years to finally walk the shores again of his beloved Ithaca.This tale continues to resonate over three thousand years since it was written. Why? Because it is a classic tale that illustrates all the great virtues of humankind: Loyalty, Courage, Heroism, Kindness, and unconditional Love. The story also illustrates our many vices, Lust, Greed, Envy, Gluttony, Sloth, Wrath and Vanity; in fact the seven deadly sins. The Odyssey is a moral tale, and heroic tale that is still as relevant today as it was three thousand years ago.The two great episodes depicted in the film are Odysseus' encounter with the man-eating Cyclops and his imprisonment on Calypso's (Vanessa Williams) island, the land of the legendary Sea Nymphs. His encounter with the enchantress, Circe (Bernadette Peters) is also done quite well. Once Odysseus returns to Ithaca, he is given a perfect disguise of a decrepit oldman from the goddess Athena, (Isabella Rossellini) to then take revenge on the many suitor's for the hand of Queen Penelope, Odysseus' wife and true love (Greta Scacchi) and to rule the kingdom of Ithaca in Odysseus' place.What Odysseus learns at the tales end, which was Athena's purpose, was to attain wisdom, a virtue or human trait that stands above all other virtues and human traits.The Odyssey is a wonderful film and an inspiration to re-read Homer's timeless epic poem.",

It should have been the best thing we have seen for about the last ten years, but the direction, editing and special effects competely sidetrack the performances.The actors are up to presenting Homer's epic - poetry is language elevated to it's highest standard - but the script was really bad, reducing character portrayals to cartoon level or worse, music videos. To give the screeplay a bit of credit, however, it's not easy to paraphrase a classic.Armand Assante sails through anyway, portraying the King of Ithaca with grand restraint. He never once lets 'what am I DOING in this thing?' slip through his characterization. One wonders if he is not imagining the Director in front of him as he swings his broadsword violently in one scene.The monsters were created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, but these particular choices show how much we really miss his design genius. Lots of neoprene there, and it showed.The story is told reasonably faithfully (similar to Odysseus' marriage..) and you do get the Cliff Notes version of it from this.

    "review/text": "In the comentary, the director upfront admitts wishing to focus on the most entertaining parts of the Odyssey and this he does. I do not believe their is much to criticize (although there are some to be done) given the fact that even with scenes removed the runtime of the film is close to four hours. Therefore credit is due for fitting as much as they did.The real strength of the movie is its staying true to the core story. Unlike myth/ancient history movies that have come up in the last few years such as Gladiator, Troy, and Alexander, which are mostly rationalized assumptions of the stories they are supposed to tell, the Odyssey stays true to the events that are written. Even little things that really don't bear a great deal on the movie (e.g. Athena being Mentor, the scar on Odysseus' leg, and Nausika finding Odysseus on the shore) are kept to ensure the purity of events.Another nice point is the talent used in this movie. Despite the effects being about 10 years old, they do not overly dominate like most multi-million dollar effects movies today. Unlike the before mentioned movies who star the current most-popular eye candy of the time to garner support for the movie, such as Orlando Bloom, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolies, the performers have more a theatre (and thus more credible ability) background.Isabella Rossillini stays true to Athena's playful toying part, Bernadette Peters is sassy and seductive as Kirke ought to be, and Vanessa Williams, though not the \"fair-haired\" as her epitath always calls her, but is exotic enough to make a convincing Kalypso.As for the critiques, they are few, and mostly scene modifications.1) Poseidon's grudge against Odysseus is his blasphemy, though in the book it is primarily the blinding of Polyphemus. This is touched in the movie, when the Kyklops calls his father to avenge him, but is never addressed. It would have been better to keep it so.2)The sheep of Helios is missing, but I believe that Karybdis is a much better effect, so that omisssion is more than forgivable.3) We always see the olive tree, but its importance should have been stressed. Penelope uses it to test Odysseus when he comes home. They could have cut out some of the lovey-duvey dialogue at the end to add that scene-it would only take about 30 seconds.4) The scene where Ares and Aphrodite are caught in bed by Hephestatus is a funny scene, and helps to explain why Odysseus eventually makes it home without Poseidon's interference. The movie on a whole does all its sex scenes tastefully, and this one could have been as well, unlike Rome and Troy where it is graphic sex for the sake of gratuitous sex.5) They might have thrown in Odysseus' conversation with Agamemnon in the underworld about being stabbed in the back by his wife, Klytemnestra, as it would help the drama when later Odysseus admits misgivings about Penelope's faithfulness to him to Athena. On the other hand, the scene in the underworld from the book is mostly a list of the procession of Persephone and the movie captures the most important parts of the chapter.Finally there are the sets. The boats are modeled after realistic triremes, and the paintings on the houses, especially Menalaus', are close to accurate. The layout of Odysseus' home complete with the Andron, and the women's quarters upstairs, and the bouletarion with Odysseus' throne shows that their set designer actually did some research (another trait often lacking in blockbuster films on ancient epics)All in all, one of the best examples of ancient epic/mythology in the media out. It stays more close to the original material, and anytone who is familiar with the work of Homer will enjoy it. Academic it may not be, but it is sucessful being entertaining as promised, but also telling the story as Homer probably wanted it to be told.",

The only hesitancy I have with it at all regards Circe and Calypso. There are some brief sexual innuendos/situations with these two women, which there are more of in the story, but generally not in the story provided in freshmen anthologies. However, at the freshmen level, it's completely within boundaries to show it. Watching the movie adds a dimension to the written word, and provides opportunities for comparing and contrasting as well. I will continue to show it.",

To know no matter how great one is, there is always one more powerful, even if it is a force unseen. 'to them the gods which Odysseus said he didnt need anymore at first only to be plagued by the cure of Posiden to suffer and never see His beloved home again'.Well worth watching for entertainment and also educational too. Youll easily find yourself watching this movie a few times.Armand Assante was a great choice to play Odysseus who plays the part flawlessly, but Vanessa Williams as Calypso... &#62;:)~ *Whistles* enough said on this.Great movie to treasure =)",

The story was followed well and stuck to the topic. My favorite character was Penelope(Greta Scacci). Somehow she knew her long lost love, Odysseus (Armand Assante), would come back some day. I thought that the specials effects were splendid. They looked so real that I though they were! The best example of this is when Odysseus and his men were told to go through a cave by an old dead prophet. It had a three-headed monster named the Silla. It ate some of the men and a cute little goat. When they reached the end, they came upon a waterfall. At the bottom, there was a monster named the Cariptus.It hid beneath the water. It ate all of the men except for lonely Odysseus. He drifted off in the water. That was also my favorite part. I think that the director, Andrei Assante did a excellent job making the story fun to watch. Though it was a bit gory in the end, I loved it. Everyone should see it.",

    "review/text": "I have just finished watching the movie, The Odyssey. It was good in many different ways. It had a lot of actors in it and many of them played their part very well. My favorite character would have to be Penelope (Greta Scacchi). She had a hard time handling the fact that her husband, Odysseus (Armand Assante), was gone at war and may never return home. The fact that her husband left right after their son was born was upsetting as well. She made a promise to her husband that when their son grew into a man, she would have to choose a new husband. After the Trojan War ended, Odysseus yelled to the gods that he didn't need their help after all, when he actually did use their help. The god of the sea, Poseidon, heard him and put a curse on him that he couldn't go home to Ithaca. Odysseus went through many extraordinary adventures and many didn't creatures while trying to get home. One of these strange creatures was Cyclops, Poseidon's brother. Cyclops (Reid Asato) is a giant with one huge eye in the middle of his forehead that loves to eat humans. Odysseus and his men floated down to the island where Cyclops lived and Cyclops asked Odysseus what his name was and Odysseus said that it was nobody. While Odysseus and his men were there with the Cyclops they gave him the gift that they had brought, which was wine. After some cups, Cyclops started to lay down and fall asleep. Once they thought that he was asleep, they took a large stake and jammed it into the Cyclops' eye. The Cyclops immediately jumped up and started to run around yelling, Nobody hurt my eye. The men escaped quickly, but the Cyclops ate the fiddler. The men that were left, left the island and floated along some more for many more adventures. In conclusion, I thought that this movie was great! It used a lot of facts from the epics by Homer.",

Following the original epic by Homer, Andrei Kanchalovsky's translation was excellent and hypnotizing. The movie started out on the rocks, trying to depic the entire Trojan War in about thirty minuites. There was much backround to tell. It climbed those rocks as the movie continued and got better and better. The movie had great actors, grotesque monsters, powerful gods, and realistic scenery.Along with the wonderful role playing by the actors, the special effects were awesome. The Cyclops looked Disgustling real and had me wondering if they really exist. Running right along Cyclops for most creative costume, was Poseidon, god of the sea. The concept of him appearing on every wave is briiliant and showed how powerful he was thought to be. The scenes in Odysseus' house were also well done. It showed what homes were like, dining manners or lack of, and strange courting coustoms of that time.The movie sparks interest to read the book if someone has not. For those who read it, it would probably clear up any questions because it does depict customs we are not familiar with. It gets a five star rating in my book!",

The trojans bring it inside the city and when they fall asleep his men attack and win the war. He them goes and brags to the gods about how the won the war with out there help. Poseidon ( Miles Anderson ) say that for this he will not let odysseus get home until he is very old. Odysseus and his men set off and they land on the island of the Cyclops and end up killing him and leaving. Next they meet the wind god and he captures all the bad winds so Odysseus can get home faster.

Odysseus and his men built a large wooden horse, hid in it, gave it to the Trojans, and attacked them after they went to sleep. That is how they beat the Trojans and won the war. After they won they started sailing back to Ethica, but they lost there way and they ended up on some on some island. The women on the island would not set Odysseus go home, but finally they let him go. Some of the ocupations were herder, sailor, worrier, ship builder, and fisher.

    "review/text": "The movie The Odyssey is based on the epic book The Odyssey that was written by Homer who was a blind author. This movie tells of a man named Odysseus (Armand Assante) who was married to Penelope (Greta Sacchi) who left to go fight in the Trojan War the day his son Telemachus (Alan Stenson) was born. After they defeated Troy in the war he told the gods that he defeated Troy without their help. This angered the god Poseidon and he put a spell on Odysseus that he will never return to Ithaca. When Odysseus and his men embarked on their voyage back home to Ithaca. The first place they stopped was the Cyclops' island to gather some food. They found the Cyclops' cave and ate his food. When the Cyclopes came back he asked them what they are doing in his cave. They gave him some wine as a gift. The Cyclops asked what Odysseus name was but Odysseus said that his name was nobody. When the Cyclops was asleep they made a sharp wooden stick and they poked the Cyclops in his eye. The Cyclops screamed to his brothers that &Ograve;nobody has stabbed me in my eye&Oacute; so his brothers did not come and help him because they think he poked himself in his eye. Odysseus and his men escaped but some were not so fortunate to escape. Next they stopped at the island were the god of the wind was named Aeolus (Michael J. Pollard). Aeolus gave Odysseus a bag of wind and told him not to open it. When he was back on the ship his men were curious about what was in the bag. When he went to sleep they opened the bag and it blew the ship to Circes island. Circe turned Odysseuss men into animals. Odysseus went to sleep with her so she can turn his men that were animals back into men. When they left her island they went to the blind prophet in the underworld and he told him the way home. They had to go through a cave to get back to Ithaca. Before they got to Ithaca they went into a whirlpool that killed everybody except Odysseus. Odysseus got back to Ithaca after he stayed at Calypso (Vanessa Williams) island for five years. The only people that recognized him was his son and a shepherd. Athena then turned Odysseus into a old man so no one knew who he was except his son. When he got to his castle they had a contest. Whoever strung Odysseuss bow and made the arrow through twelve axes would marry Penelope. Odysseus did and killed everyone who invaded his palace. He joined Penelope and had a happy life.The style of clothing they had in Ithaca was called a tunic. Only the wealthy people would have dyed tunics. The average person wore a white tunic. The main crop in Ithaca was olives which took a lot of olives to make a little bit of olive juice. Back then when someone goes to another persons island they bring gifts. The people of Ithaca and other islands believed in gods. They gave sacrifices to the gods so they will help them in the future. Greece was a rugged land that was in Europe. The different types of occupations in Ithaca were herders who handled sheep, ship builders, and fishers. This was a very good movie and I hope you will enjoy it too.",

I excspesially liked the characters...Odysseus, Penelope, Athena, and the Cilla. It all started when Odysseus has a boy and on the same day he is called off to war. The war was fought for ten years untill they gave up and built the trojan horse. They hid in the Trojan Horse and waited till the Trojans were asleep and then they attaced. When they beet the Trojans they angered Posidieon, god of the sea. They got lost on the way home and ended up in a cave, SNAP! The Cilla came down and was eating the men they paddeld for ther life to the other side of the cave were ther was a big drop of. Odysseus jumped and grabed a vine but he couldnt hold him self up long and he fell. He was the only one left he woke up on a mysterious island were only beutiful wemon lived. They tried to keep him there until a good sent for them to let him go. He built a raft and sailed off and finaly after monsters and evil sorcerors he came home to find that all of his friends were herassing his wife, so he killed them and lived happily ever after.",

My favorite person in this movie was Odysseus because he was the most interesting. Odysseus left his family to go fight the trojan war. They got in a horse in went into the trojan home. And when they came out of the horse they beat the trojans. After they left there he had a very hard life. They met the cyclops and they were very scared of the man and to get out of the cave they had to blind him. And then he went on a island for five years. Than he left the island because circe sade to go to the under world to hades. He went to hades and gave him a sacerfise and hades told him how to get home from there. Meanwhile penelope and her son are waiting for Odysseus come back. After he left the under world he went to fight scylla and scylla killed his whole crew. After that he floated to this little island. Their was alot of wemen on this island and they never saw a man before in their life. And the calypso kept the man on the island. After this he got a crew to make him a boat and he went home. The kind of clothes they wore was wool and leather. There main crop was olives and they had very bad land back than. And that is it I give this movie 2 thumbs up. Odyssus would bring a goat for a present to a god.",

    "review/text": "When my Social Studies teacher said we would watch the Odyssey, I thought it was going to be boring. Boy, was I wrong! Odysseus (Armand Assante), king of Ithica, had to go to war against Troy. The same day, his wife, Penelope (Greta Scacchi), had also given birth to his first son. The Trojan War lasted about 10 years, until Odysseus came up with the idea for the Trojan Horse. This clever idea won the battle for the Greeks. Odysseus, though, thought he won without the help of the Gods. Poseidon (Miles Anderson), the god of the sea, was angered greatly by this. He told Odysseus that he would never get home. Odysseus and his crew would spend the next twenty years trying to get home. On the way, Odysseus met many people and creatures such as Calypso (Vanessa Williams), the Cyclops (Reid Asato), Circe (Bernadette Peters), and Aeolus (Michael J. Pollard), God of the Winds. The ships and clothes were extremely authentic and the special effects were great. The movie was A LOT like the story, which rarely happens with movies. Homer, the blind Greek poet that made this story, would have been proud. I liked this movie and thought it was very good. I also learned a lot about the Greeks, such as their behavior, clothes, names, and the way everything looked back then. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",

First Lord Odysseus goes out and fights the Trojan War and he won after won 10 years. He won because he built the Trojan horse to take in the kingdom and then they would get out of it and kill everyone. After that they get on their boat and sail for days. Now remember it is foggy and they lossdirections. They see land and go to it. Well, they find out that it is Cyclops Island. They get off that Island and then go to the God Wind's Island (Michael J. Pollard playing as Aeolus). He ( the God of Wind) gave Odysseus a bag of wind to help sail home. They get near their island but, someone opends the bag and a storm appears and again they get blown off coruse. Now, their on the Goddess Island, The Witch (Calypso). They don't know their on her Island. Some people went looking for food and the witch turned them into animals. Only one animal comes back. Now Odysseus climbs up the mountain but before he gets to the top of the mountain the messanger God (Hermes) tells him to eat the grass that he is getting ready to give him, so when he drinks the witches honey he won't turn into an animal. After that the witch will take him to bed.When he wants to leave the witch tells him that it felt like 5 days to you but its really been 5 years. So now he has been away from his Island 15 years.At the end he does get home and kills the men that were going to see which one was going to marry his wife. Everything they used back then they used in the movie. It seemed like I was there in Greece when the movie was playing. The food and how they got olive oil was just like they did it a long time ago. The best part I thought was how the gods look so real. The gods were sometimes mean or nice depending on who you are or if you did something bad. You counldn't grow much crops back then.",

    "review/text": "The Odyssey By, TheresaThis movie, The Odyssey wasn't what I call great but it was okay. Odysseus was the main character and he was the king of Ithica. His wife was Penelope. They had a son named Telemachus. Odysseus had to fight in the Trojan War. Of course Ithica won but the only reason why is because they came up with the idea of the Trojan Horse. Poseidon had got mad at Odysseus and put a curse on him. Odysseus had many great adventures. One was that he went to a island ruled by Circe. Circe put a spell on some of his men that made them turn into animals. Before that they found their selves on an island of the Cyclops. A couple of men were killed but they escaped. Back to Circe, she put a spell on the men and Odysseus went to her home . Before he got to her home the god's messenger, Hermes gave a special poison to Odysseus so he could with stand her spell. She tricked them by making five years seem like five days. He met two creatures, the Silla and the Ceripdus. He lost his men as well as his boat. He found his self at Calypso's island for about a year or so. Hermes told Calypso that if she doesn't let him go she would have to deal with Zeus. When she let him go he found his way home with the help of Poseidon. Overall, this is one of the most goriest movies I've seen. My favorite character is Circe because she has the power to change people into animals.",

When odysseus finally saw his wife Penelope and when they hugged each other and crying, It was very touching. The other part that was very interesting is when he went to the underworld to see hades with all of the fire, the the lost souls, It seemed very realistic and really gave me the creeps. The best part of the movie was when the men have to had to put the string on odysseus bow to attach it together and when they have that over with, they have to take an arrow so they have shot through five holes perfectly without missing a thing! I was really surprised when he knew where all the to put the string on the bow and he was was very strong for an old man. Then he turned into an old person again!It was a very interesting part. The only thing I didnt like about the movie was too much killing in the movie I didnt like that. Its kind of like the movie Gladiator. The way how the made olive oil was to take the olives and put them in this squasher and they press it very hard. I also love the way the womens clothing were they were long and beautiful.",

    "review/text": "Intoxicated, I had just finished The Iliad and The Odyssey. I came to the conclusion that I still hold, that Homer is one of the greatest poets of all time, (and to his merit, I deduce this from a translation, and even very good translation saps a massive percentage of goodness from almost any poetry).Then, a few days later, upon entrance into the incandescent crucible of Freshman English class, we started \"studying\" the Odyssey, and to the stupid pleasure of my classmates, our teacher in her benevolence announced that we would be watching this piece of worthless crap supplementing our piecemeal \"study\" of the Odyssey. I was skeptical, but I could not have been prepared for the ensuing blasphemy. I am not inclined to waste my time recalling every freakish perversion of plot, travesty of drama as an art form, embarrassment to the special effects crew, and overall mockery of Homer that this film contained, but let it suffice to say that there was not one well done instant in the whole film, not one moment that gave me anything akin the orgasmic mythopoeic thrill I encountered in the poem itself.This is not to say that I did not enjoy the film- far from it. During the few minutes when my head was not hooded and submerged under my desk, during the hilarious moments when my ears were not frantically plugged, I had about as much comic relief to the perdition of high school as a boy can ask for. After hearing Aelous, I relished thoughts of mutilating the \"brains\" behind this catastrophe. And I suppose I have a soft spot for patently fake gore and cheesy pseudo-Gothic atmospheres of \"terror\", and the Scylla scene pandered to that. I pretended I was watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and enjoyed myself. I LOVE crappy special effects!!I was shocked to learn that this was made in 1997. I truly believed this was made in the 60's.Homer, I praise thee, and maybe I shall avenge thy memory.",

Book 9 (The cylcops episode) perhaps he greatest book of the poem is reduced to [junk](oh by the way Odysseus does not kill Hector- Achillles does).And Achilles would never lead his men into a cave and steal food in the first place, Anyway the poem among many other things explores the nature of KLEOS--(reknown) and Odysseus's kleos does not fit any of he conventional definitions. 1 He is a Bowman (not pictured in the film)--which means he gets to fight behind the lines of the hoplites 2 He is self-serving--almost hubristic as he himself reveals in Books 9-12 the longest sustained 1st person narration in epic (Virgil ties to copy it) 3 He constantly gets his shipmates into trouble (not a great commander). He is a liar and the opposite of the traditional Greek Hero (This is why Ajax turns his back on him in the underworld) He is however a great storyteller--and that itself is a kind of KLEOS. The language of Book 9 is so replete with puns and formulae whose natures become ironically charged coming from Odysseus mouth, that it is one of the most subtle exploations of tradition ever composed. One (and this includes Sophocles) does not know what do make of him--do we admire him or hate him? He is finally sui generis which is why he has been depicted in so many ways throuhout history. This is the CORE of the poem--a center which the film ignores. For a good rendition of the Odyssey watch O Brother Where art Thou? Or read Joyce's ULYSSES.",

I'd almost agree, other than the faces. Aiolos, Poseidon, and the Cyclops' faces all looked very similar. If you notice, while the cyclops is talking, his mouth does not form the words, it merely opens and closes.And the aciting. AHHHHHH. The accents didn't even match up between Penelope and her son Telemachos. Odysseus, Penelope, and Telemachos all sounded completely different. Of course, Odysseus's accent changed every few scenes, so who can blame his family for not keeping up?Oh yes, back to similarities with the book. When Telemachos visits Menelaos, the chapter is titled \"The Red Haired King and His Lady\" the Menelaos of the movie had black hair, not red. Oh yes, and his beard wasn't the same color as his freakishly-fake ringlets. Similarly, Athena was mentioned time and time again in the book as \"the grey eyed goddess...\". Athena of the movie had blue eyes.I could keep going, but I won't. If you still think this was a good depiction of Homer's The Odyssey, get therapy. Serious therapy.",

They're not cheap looking which is something TV movies have a problem with sometimes. The costumes are good and the sets are too.

    "review/summary": "Successful Rendition of Homer's Classic",
    "review/text": "There is a definite \"Hollywood\" flavor to Homer's classic, but The Odyssey comprises much of the story and, yet, keeps the viewer engaged with visual special effects. Approximately 3 hours in length, this film embodies the main aspects of Homer's story without getting too detailed. Perhaps many people didn't care much for this film because it is not completely accurate to the story. It seems to me that many of the parts that were altered were minor in nature and, in general, didn't affect the overall quality of the film. The producers of The Odyssey seemed to be wary of accuracy when it came to telling the major points of the story.The casting was great. Armand Assante does a good job of portraying the hero, Odysseus. He seems to capture the leadership qualities intended to the journey back to Ithaca. Bernadette Peters is cast as Circe, Vanessa Williams is Calypso, and Isabella Rossellini plays Athena, the goddess of Wisdom, and Greta Scacchi plays Penelope, Odysseus' wife.What makes this particularly a wonderful movie is that it serves two purposes. It teaches the main points of The Odyssey to those who are not familiar with it, and it is a modern adaptation that can be appreciated by the \"reluctant\" viewers of classics. Encompassed within the film are many of the adventures that Odysseus experiences in Homer's epic poem: the Trojan War, the Trojan Horse, the Cyclops, Hades (the Land of the Dead), Calypso's Island, Circe's Island, The wrath of Poseidon, The Suitors and the Suitor's Challenge, Penelope's Test of Odysseus' faith.Most of the time, visual effects do little to awe me, especially when there is a story to be told. But, imagery and setting aids in creating a true epic feel in The Odyssey. The camera angles of vast sea while they are afloat, the images of the setting sun and moon, the depiction of the God of the Sea, Poseidon, and his angry wrath on Odysseus, the realistic images of The Cyclopes (and other creatures), and the battles between the Greeks and Trojans all serve to establish a \"grandiose\" effect of the epic poem. All these visuals give the story a \"larger than life\" feel.Aspects of The Odyssey that were irksome were overdone scenes with Odysseus and his \"temptors\"-Calypso and Circe. They seemed to drag these out unnecessarily and tried to be a little too \"heated\" with some of the lines and sexual innuendos. It seemed that they could have edited these more and given more time and effort in another more important aspect of Odysseus adventure-such as his return to Ithaca.What one must take in mind before viewing this and other classics on film is that often it is a \"retelling\" of the story; this being said, The Odyssey is \"almost\" accurate. Overall, this is a film that successfully depicts Homer's classic with integrity.Rating: 4 1/2 stars.Also recommended: Jason and The Argonauts, Clash of the Titans",

Not only are the gods the most powerful creatures on Earth, but Poseidon is the god of the sea...and Odysseus has to sail home. During the next 20 years, he has a great big adventure, mixed with people that want to kill him, people that want to help him along, and some monsters that want to eat him.This movie is not just a fantasy adventure, it's history! The ancient greek poet Homer wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey. The Iliad was the story that came before the Odyssey (check it out!). This poet livedlived in the time period in which he wrote, so he had plenty of culture in the Odyssey. We can learn alot about history this way, because the people in the movie do the same things that the ancient greeks did. The same food, customs, clothes, etc. In the Odyssey they use goats alot, just like in ancient greece. They used the for clothing, food, and sacrifice. Aside from all this, the special effects were good and so were the actors. Overall, I would give this movie 5 stars-it was great!",

    "review/text": "\"Mr. Noteboom\"?? Are we supposed to take that name seriously? Anyway, please disregard the negative reviews you may have seen elsewhere at Amazon. This movie really is one of the top two or three mini-series/TV movies I've ever seen, the others being \"Gulliver's Travels\", \"Merlin\" and, while I couldn't follow the plot to save me, the art direction for \"The Magic Legend of the Leprechauns\" was unlike ANYTHING you've ever seen! I hate to admit it. but NBC was really on a roll back then! However, they were overreaching by the time \"The 10th Kingdom\" came out.This is the classic story of Odysseus/Ulysses and his trip back from the Trojan War that is delayed for 20 years by his own hubris and the incompetency and mischief of his sailing crew. Armand Assante parlays this role well, and as far as I'm concerned, is the most \"Italian\" Italian-American actor I've seen in my years of watching TV and movies. His way works for ancient Greeks too, as the accent he uses, borrowed from his own background, makes you feel as if you are indeed watching the adventures of an ancient Mediterranean soldier and his men returning to their home in Ithaca.The producers of this well-directed and produced gem help also, by assembling some of the best art directors, actors and locales for this gift from Newton Minnow-land that they could get. One of the great little cameos in this movie is the one made by Michael J. Pollard as Aeolus, God of the Wind. He plays the part like an impish leprechaun who wants to teach his bullying brother Poseidon a lesson by helping Odysseus, who is in the mess he's in because he initially OFFENDED Poseidon with his boast that he didn't need the gods to do what he did in winning the battle in Ilium. The upshot of Aeolus' help?: Aeolus gives Odysseus a bag filled with a powerful wind and is told not to open it unless absolutely necessary. His foolish crew, and they are generally portrayed AS buffoons, opens the bag just as they approach Ithaca, and are blown way off course as the tornado within Aeolus' gift bag is released!Other good performances in this movie, (besides the myriad of excellent bit parts by various character actors,) are: Greta Sacchi as Penelope, Odysseus' \"wife\"; Isabella Rossellini as Athena, his guardian angel; Irene Papas as his mother and Bernadette Peters as Circes, the sorceress who \"bewitches\" his crew by turning them into animals. And yet again, her nibs, Geraldine Chaplin, a woman whose taste in movies to play minor roles in is impeccable, is also in here as one of Penelope's most trusted servants. You'll love the guy playing the musician in Odysseus' crew! Isabella Rossellini, however, is a charmer of the first water. This woman has more charisma than the goddess she's portraying, as far as I'm concerned. Between that innocent, plaintive voice, those big aquamarine eyes, those continental features, and that gentle way she inherited from her mother, Ingrid Bergman, she just has \"it\" in bags! She should really think about starring in larger regular features, instead of the art house fare she's usually in. She shines in both this mini-series and \"Merlin\", in which she has a much larger role. Her gamin-like quality truly comes out in the Arthurian drama, produced by the same people.To top this all off, there's TWO of her!! Ms. Rossellini actually has a twin sister! The Lord worketh in mysterious ways!Make no mistake, there is a warmth, a definite \"sangre\", to this production, that is wholly missing from just about any other TV movie I can remember. There is definite humor...feelings of love and loyalty and all around good acting are involved here.Most of the scenes from the original Homerian epic are in here, but a notable absence is that of the ship encountering the Sirens and Odysseus being tied to the ship's mast so he won't fall prey to their lure, perhaps the most famous scene FROM the poem. What was the director thinking when he left this out? The scenes in Hades are also excellent, as you really are put in a gloomy, somewhat eerie mood by the effects, and the long-awaited tableau of the return of the warrior to his beloved Ithaca and the dispatching of his rivals for Penelope's affections are also done well.Who is this Professor \"Noteboom\", anyway....is he any relation to Corrie Ten-Boom??",

    "review/text": "As a part of teaching 7th graders ancient Greek history every spring, I have the privilege of introducing to them Homer's &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. They think they know what real adventure is till they learn about Odysseus' grand voyage home from the Trojan War. And then--when we watch this movie, the students have a much greater appreciation not only for real adventure, but real literature!Filmed on location around the Mediterranean, the film captures the perilous journey of Odysseus back to Ithica and his beloved Penelope. The glaring weakness of the script is attempting to condense the Trojan War into a half-hour. Nevertheless, Achilles' slaughter of Hector is awesome, and after all--the film isn't titled 'The Iliad'.While the 7th graders enjoy the mysterious Aeolus (and his bag of winds), and less so Vanessa Williams' seductive Calypso (which gets a bit 'steamy'), there is simply nothing to compare to two scenes. First, the Scylla and Charybdis, which evoke all the surprise, blood, and special effects which today's teenager expects (without overdoing any of the three), and second, the concluding sequence where Odysseus is revealed to the wicked suitors who have &quot;...stolen (his) world&quot;, and violated the most sacred of ancient Greek customs--hospitality. The bloodletting here is intense, but Homer would certainly have applauded the interpretation presented.Not all of Odysseus' ten adventures are included in the film. For example, we do not see the lotus-eaters, the slaughter of the cattle of Helius, the rescue by the sea nymph Ino, etc. But what we do see is wonderful! One will never forget the belching and monstrous cyclops who (again) pictures for us the unavoidable punishment Greeks felt was certain to befall the inhospitable! Also missing is the death of Odysseus' faithful dog Argos upon beholding his master's return.Finally, also missing is what would have been a great visual scene--Odysseus bound to the mast of his ship as he experienced the wonder of the deadly sirens' call--and lived to tell about it! I also found it just a bit disconcerting that although we see King Menelaus of Sparta, we see nothing of his wife Helen whose beautiful 'face launched a thousand ships' and started the whole darn Trojan War in the first place. And where is Paris...? (Oh yes, I forgot again--this is &quot;The Odyssey&quot;!)For me, the highlight is Odysseus' trip to the underworld to seek the blind prophet's direction on how to get back home. Though combining two of four rivers of the underworld into one (the Styx, and the Phlegethon--river of fire), the sequence loses none of the magical mystery of the Greek conception of the afterlife. Even included is the haunting meeting of Odysseus and his mother who committed suicide, in believing her son would never come home.Bernadette Peters' Circe sequence is as humerous as it is clever, and watching Odysseus' men turn back into men from animals is memorable. Nevertheless, character development is often sacrificed at the expense of trying to cover the many adventures, but I guess one can't have it both ways!The special effects are great--especially the face of Poseidon in the waves as he strives to punish Odysseus for blinding his son (the cyclops), and (as one of my students pointed out) in reality, ends up making our hero a better man, by crushing his hubris, and teaching him the ultimate Greek lesson: &quot;...man is nothing without the gods!&quot;Great movie! Whether they know the classic tale or not, the film will entertain teenagers (and most everyone else). But as a supplement to teaching the great literature pieces of Homer...ah, it doesn't get any better than this! Now, if the same director would only make &quot;The Iliad&quot;....",

On Odysseus journey back to Ithica he encounters many obstacles. The first obstacle is the god Poseidon. He makes Poseidon mad and Poseidon would not let him go back home to Ithica. Odysseus meets one god named Aeolus on his way who is the god of the wind. Aeolus puts all the bad winds in a bag and he gives them a wind to take them home. The curious crewman opens the bag and knocks them off track. Odysseus meets many more gods and things like Cyclops and the three headed monster. Odysseus finally makes it back to Ithica.

The whole idea of Homer's epic is how a mortal man was able to think his way through situations. I think that the movie portrayed this well. Another important element in Homer's epic is the commitment of Odysseus and his wife, Penelope, toward each other. Although it could have been protrayed better, I think this romantic theme is evident throughout the movie. As a historical account of Homer's tale, it could be improved. As a movie, I think it's great!",

    "review/text": "The Odyssey is probably one of the most well-known stories of Western literature. It contains elements of suspense, action, adventure, fantasy, romance, and even some comedy. It is also quite long, and features a big cast of characters; human and non-human. With all of this, it would seem to be a perfect candidate for a top-notch movie. Surprisingly, Hollywood has made very few movies about this topic, with probably the best one being this production by Hallmark.The storyline follows the original epic quite well in terms of action. The casting is better than average, as Armande Assante does look like he is of Mediterranean descent, and gratefully, does not speak with an English accent as Sean Bean's Odysseus in the movie \"Troy\". The special effects are as Hallmark movies go; believable but not extravagant. The dialogue is somewhat flat. For such a famous epic with so many hundreds of English translations, the director should have tried to make this tale like Kenneth Branagh with his Shakespeare movies; have the characters speak the dialogue from the original text. Other than that, no noticeable flaws. Nothing spectacular but still worth the 3+ hours to watch this movie.",

I liked the fact how the gods appear every now and then to the mortals they are playing their wee games with. If you are looking for the type of fantasy that you might have enjoyed as a kid, then you will find this very entertaining. I also like that although i have not read the odyssey. i feel the story given in this film is probably reasonably faithfull to the adventures told in that famous book.This production required a big budget and while not up to top shelf blockbuster standards of today, it does a very nice job of telling a very epic adventure.",

I don't exactly know if the story of it is so much of an epic that it has been handed down from generation after generation, but it is a pretty neat story of the certainly specific greek gods like the water god Poseidon and the goddess Calypso. They are just 2 examples who don't have very big parts, and I'm guessing it is not only them, but they all have SOME significance in the legend. It has to be some sort of a legend, otherwise, I would not care much for \"The Odyssey\" because it might not be at a big budget. Come to think of it, \"Creepshow\" could be a low budget horror film, but that's another story. At least rent this to see what I mean. Believe me, it's not as horrible as it is overally rated by other reviewers who probably do not have any respect for this movie's story and the \"epic\" of it. I'm quite interested.",

If I were rating this movie between 1 and 10, I would give it an 11. Odysseus was really fun to watch because he was so brave and was ready for any obsticle. He won all the battles he fought and still lived to tell his amazing story. Odysseus was also persistant because for many years he was gone on his voyage and he never got to see his son nor his wife for such a long time. I would of gone crazy and killed myself. But Odysseus kept going. He would not give up. The Trojan War was also neat because you get to see the Trojan Horse. You get to see how they used it and what it looked like on the inside.

    "review/text": "if you have read and liked the book, or know anything about the story, this movie would certainly want to make you want to kill yourself. odysseus is portraid as rugged, stupid barbarian who is nothing like the hero Homer described him as. the special effects aren't too uplifting either, although it was a pretty low budget film. all of the events in the movie are nothing like in the book; it was as thought the writer's had never even read it!!! bad acting, cheesy special effects, and a completely inaccurate plot make Hallmark's version of the odyssey one of the worst movies to ever come out of a classic novel. in conclusion, i'd rather go to Hades than watch this movie!",

On the first day of Ancient Greece, my teacher popped the video in the VCR and made us take catagorized notes.Since it was our first day we had no idea about Greece's history, gods and goddesses, heroes or political science.However, the Odyssey told my class and I a great deal about Greece.One of the reasons why I reccommend this movie, is your (or your child, for that matter) don't know too much on Ancient Greece, you put the movie in the VCR, and 2 hours done with the credits rolling, you will know so much about Ancient Greece.It occured to me that in this movie The Odyssey about Odysseus leaving Ithaca for the Trojan war and fight the curse of Poseidon, underneath it all there is the political science and the goddesses and gods history and way of life and the scenery.Over all this is an amazing movie.",

    "review/text": "I first watched this mini-series when I was 11 years old and I have loved it ever since. The series begins near the end of Homer's The Iliad and then continues through Homer's The Odyssey. I read The Odyssey and I have studied mythology for years. When watching a movie or mini-series, differences are expected. Given these considerations, the epic and the series are extremely similar. I do not believe the differences diminish the affect of the series in this case.I do not recommend this series if you expect Homer's exact epic in cinematic form. However, if you like mythology, the references and the story of this epic will keep you enthralled. If you do not like mythology, you may be interested in the action of the series. Either way, I believe it is an excellent choice for entertainment and learning purposes. I hope you enjoy.",

    "review/text": "In Social Studies class I viewed the movie The Odyssey. The Odyssey is a movie based on the epic tale of Homer. This movie tells the story of Odysseus (Aramand Assente)King Of Ithaca journey from the land of Troy, where the Trojan War was fought for ten years. After Odysseus and his men had won the war he angered the god Posideon, god of the sea. During the movie Poseidon does many things to stop Odysseus. On Odysseus' trip back to Ithica he inconters monsters like the Scylla &amp; Cyclops. Also in Odysseus trip he inconters the god the Wind, Aeolus. Aleolus helps odyessus get back to his land, but his crew open the evil winds and the voyage continues. They get blown back to the Island of Circe where the stay for 5 days but it is really 5 years.After they leave the island of Circe Odyessus travels to the underworld. When he comes out he inconters the Scyllca, and all his men are killed. Odyessus survives and he swims to the island of Clpso where he stays for 5 years. After he leaves he travels to the island of Finnisha where he is given a ship and crew to travel home. I think that this was a very good movie , and I would recommend this movie for educational &amp; enjoyment purposes.Steven Fahed",

    "review/text": "The Odssey was written by Homer in 1300 B.C. The movie starts out with Penelope birthing her son Telemachus. That same day Odysseus had to leave to fight in the Trojan war. While sailing Odysseus talked to the god Athena. She told him all of his men had some flaws, but Odysseus said that they where like brothers and he could not let them go. When they got to Troy now known as Turkey Odysseus fought with a great warrior called Achilles. They fought for them hard years and Odysseus thought of the Trojan horse. They sent it and said it was a gift for the Trojans because they gave up. So they brought it in side of their walls and after a night of wine and women the Trojans began to rest. Then the men came out of the horse and destroyed everything inside the walls. Then Odysseus said that he did it all without the god. That made Poseidon angry, so he told Odysseus that he would never make it home to Ithaca. I think this movie was a great way to learn about the gods and the Greeks. I also thought it was a great idea film it in Greece. My favorite charecter was Calypso because she was a lovely lady that had not seen a man in a hundred years. This movie also taught me that the Greeks believed in Polytheism which means they believed in many gods. Another thing I learned was they ate with their hands. Another thing I noticed was they brought gifts to everyone they visited. That is my movie review on the Odyssey, have a nice day.By: Jared Kellison",

    "review/text": "When the Trojan War breaks, the King of Ithaca, Odysseus must help defend Greece. The same day, Penelope gave birth to their son, Telemachus. While sailing to the War, Odysseus meets his patron goddess, Athena. She warns him of his crew, telling him of all their flaws. But Odysseus doesn't heed her warning. When Odysseus and his crew reach Troy, they fight. The men fought for ten years. The Greeks finally win when they build a giant wooden horse. The Trojans take the horse into the town and party. When all the Trojans are asleep, the Greeks slip out of their wooden steed and ruin Troy. The day, Odysseus yells to the Gods, saying that a mere mortal distroed Troy by himself. This is when the Odysseys really starts. The journey back to Ithaca starts out fine. But Posiden doesn't want Odysseus to go home. The first event of the trip is Odysseus and his crew's meeting with the one-eyed Cyclops. Odysseus, being the smart and sly king of Ithaca tell the Monster that his name is nobody. he then blinds the monster. he and his crew then said to an uninhabited island where they meet with the god of wind, Aeolus. He gives the crew a gift of wind. The crew then sails and meets Circe who turns the crew into animals based on their personality. They then travel to the underworld. When leaving the underworld, they meet Scylla, who kills half of the crew. The Odysseus found Clypso's Island and stayed there for five years. Odysseus then returns home. Not only is the was the Odyssey a good movie, it was historically accurate. The movie shows occupations of the Greek people, the food they ate and the clothing that they wore. Everything was accurate, down to the smallest detail of sacrifices to their god. Men wore tunics and women wore dresses. Did you know that the Greeks at e goat cheese, drank water, and used olive oil to cook with? Some of the occupations of the Greeks were farmers, leader, and council members.",

    "review/text": "Casey DuVall, 8th grade, B3,D2 Okay, you are standing in a movie rental store, and you have narrowed down your choices to two movies and you can only get one. In one hand you have The Odyssey, one of the two epics written by Greek poet Homer retold in a TV movie, and in the other hand Jackie Chan's newest action-adventure. Part of you want to see Jackie lay the smack down on some international terrorists and the other half knows that The Odyssey will help you academically. You decide that your parents and teachers would be proud if you rented The Odyssey, so you decide that that is the movie you will rent. But, don't you think that you are in store for one major snore fest, The Odyssey is a wild movie with off-the-hook special effects that will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. We start off in Ithaca, where the main character, Odysseus, has decided to head out with his Greek allies to fight in the Trojan War. Odysseus must leave to fight on the day of his son's birth, and tells his wife Penelope that if he does not return by the time his son is a man, to remarry. On the way to Troy we meet all kinds of characters! We meet all of Odysseus' men, Achilles, and Hector. Achilles is a warrior that can only be harmed in his ankle tendon, and Hector is Troy's general. The war wages on for 10 years, when finally, Odysseus comes up with a plan that will defeat Troy's armies for sure. He plans to build a giant, hollow horse that the Trojan's will wheel inside their gigantic walls, and after the party all night, Odysseus and his men will take over the city and win the war. The plan was going according to plan but a lone prophet believed that the Greeks were up to something, so Poseidon sent a sea serpent to dispose of the troublesome prophet. After the Greeks win the war, Odysseus states that he defeated the Trojan's without anyone help. Poseidon grows very angry at Odysseus and says that he will never go home. After Odysseus and his men set out, Poseidon sends them to an island whose only inhabitant is the giant-one eyed Cyclops! Just wait until you see how they escape, it is very exciting. Odysseus then goes to another island and meets Aesol, God of the wind and Poseidon's cousin, who bottles up all the bad wind into a giant sack. He said that the good wind will carry them home in 9 days, but that would be to easy! Ithaca is finally in sight when one of his men opens the sack and sends them across the globe to Circe, a mean witch who's honey potion changes men into animals. She changes all his men into animals. The trick would have worked on Odysseus, but Hermes had given him a special, poisonous weed that protected him from her potion. He stays there and gets a royal treatment from Circe and her maids, but instead of staying there for 5 days, she stays there for 5 years! Circe tells him he must go to the Underworld and ask the blind prophet Tiresias to find the way home. After he sacrifices a ram he also finds out that he will meet two monsters, the Scylla and Charybdis. After their encounter with the two beasts, Odysseus had lost all his men, and was staying afloat by a single piece of wood from his ship. He floats along the sea, desperately trying to swim towards land, and he does. There he meets Calypso, a goddess with witch like powers, and all her maids. She plans to marry him, but Hermes brings news to her that if she does not release him, Zeus will send her island to the bottom of the sea because it is not his fate to die on her island. He builds a make-shift raft and sets out in search of Ithaca. Poseidon then unleaches monstourus waves upon Odysseus that destroyed his boat. He tells Odysseus that men are nothing without gods, and until he understands that, he will never return to Ithaca. Meanwhile in Ithaca, many suitors from around the world came in search of Penelope's hand in marriage. They tormented her servants, pilfered his food and drink, and demeaned Penelope herself. But, back to Odysseus, who after his fight with Poseidon, was washed on the shore of Phoenician. After they found out who the stranger was, they sent him to Ithaca, and while on the way, finally understand what Poseidon had said. At Ithaca, instead of making his precencs known instantly, he was transformed into an old beggar to discover who his friends were after all these years. When Penelope stated the challenge, the suitors thought that it was easy. They had to string Odysseus' bow and shoot it through 12 axe handles. After everyone tried, and failed, the old man completed the task and transformed into his old self. Then Odysseus and his son, Telemachus, killed all his wife's suitors in a gory battle. Then they all lived happily ever after.",

Before he left he told Penelope( his wife)that she should remarry when his son had grown a beard. He went and fought in the Trojan war for ten years and then he told the god Poisedon that he had won the war without the gods. So Poseidon curses him to roam the seas until he realizes that humans are nothing without gods. He then goes to the Island of the Cyclops but does not know that the Cyclops is there. He goes into a cave and he eats goat cheese which was common for the time. He also drinks wine and gets the Cyclops drunk. He stabs him in his one eye. Odysseus goes on to fight a witch but ends up taking her to bed. He stays with the witch for five years. He then goes to the underworld and finds the old prophet who tells him how to get to Ithaca his home. He sets out on the journey again when his ship is attacked by a three headed monster. Before he can catch his breath he is attacked by a tidal pool monster who eats the ship. Odysseus catches a branch but later falls and floats to and island with Calypso and her virgin nymphs. He stays there for two years and then goes to sea again. He sees Poisedon and tells him that he understands. Poisedon then lets him go to his home and kill all of the men who were staying there. He is soon reunited with his wife and they live happily ever after.",

I also enjoyed the part of odysseus's son Telemachrus. He knew his father was alive and was not going to give up on finding him, even if it meant looking for him, himself. The odyssey was written by Homer. Homer wove ancient tales of gods and heroes into parts of epic poetry like he did with the odyssey.",

And on his journey he came to the 3 headed creature that ate three of his men. And the witch that turned one of his men into a pig. And if you are into things that has to deal with the ocean this is just the movie for you it has some very good and nice pictures for you in it. And the food they ate was things like goatchesse,goatmeat,and goat milk. They traded the gods for a goat because the land that they lived on was very rocky and water was everywhere and they couldn't grow alot of crops. And everyday they would have something like a party when all them sit around and drink wine and watch the pretty girls dance. The type of clothes they wore, they wore these kilts and the queen had to wear something that covered half of her face. And Odysseus had been gone for 15 years and he told his wife if he wasn't back by time his son was a man that she should remarry and that what she was going to do and the man that she was going to marry had to shoot a arrow through six of these little holes things and the only one that could do it was her husband. And Athena helped him to descise hiself and after he shot the arrow he came back to his old self. and the saddest part of the movie was when his mother killed herself.",

It is mainly about a man naned &Ograve;Odysseus&Oacute; going on and completing something like a journey.He is fighting in the Trojan War. But in this journy he was trying to be stopped by the voices, and faces of Posiedon {Miles Anderson} But Odysseus was determined not to give in on his journey. Odysseus had to go to war on the day of his sons birth .So he had to leave his new-born son, and his wife &Ograve;Penelope&Oacute; {Greta Scacchi}. My favorite part in this movie was when Odysseus and his men had to stab Cyclops {Reid Asabo} to escape from his den. I also really liked the graphics, the music, and how everything looked real. And the way that they dressed was neat too. My favorite characters are; Hermes{Freddy Douglas} because he helped Odysseus out alot during his journey. And Calypso {Vanessa Williams} because she was kind enough to take Odysseus in. And I really felt her pain when she had to see Odysseus leave, or better yet ask him to leave.This movie is full of action , and very interesting.Derryck Anderson",

Odysseus and his warriors got into this giant horse while the people of Troy were getting drunk and having a good time.After the people of Tory had passed out, Odysseus and his people crawled out of the horse, and defeated the people of Troy. Then after the war, Odysseus tried to go back home but got stuck on an island. While he was there, on the island, he encountered the Cyclops. (The giant with one eye, that liked to eat people) Odysseus defeated the Cyclops, and then tried again to go home. Ten years of being in Troy, and on the island Odysseus finally made it home. When he got there, the saw his wife Penelope, and son Telemochus. They were so happy because they had thought that Odysseus had died fighting in the Trogan war.",

I liked the fact that the DVD made it easy to edit out parts, and the scenes are accessible to easily fit class time available. The representation of daily life in ancient Greece were accurate enough to give light to the subject, and since the movie was filmed in Greece the students and I were treated to authentic view of the country. I will certainly use this again! (My computer DVD player hooked up to the lcd projector gave a wonderful, huge, clear picture. Great stuff!)",

    "review/text": "The Odyssey Written by Crystal OwensThe movie review for the Odyssey contains what happens in the movie. In the movie Odysseus was the leader of paracies,between about 460 and 429. The Greeks had a war between the Trojan that lasted 10 years. They defeated them by hiding in side of an horse, and then when the men were asleep they got out and fought him and they won. Then they went to Cyclopes and Odysseus told him that his name was nobody. When Cyclopes went to sleep they stabbed him in the eye. Odysseus went to get some air, and he ran into the man that controlled the wind and he filled Odysseus bag with air and told him not to open it. Then one of his men opened the bag while he was asleep and when he opened it the wind was so strong that it knocked over the boat,and they all were stuck on an island with no food and no boat. So some of the men went to find food on their own, and they ran into Sesaes. They drunk some of wine and they all turned in to animals. So Odysseus went to check it out and a man with wings told him to eat the leaf that he gave him or he will turn in to an animal like the rest of his men. So he ate the leaf, and when he drinks the wine he will not turn and then she is going to want him to sleep with her, so he did. She kept him up there for 5 years and she told him were to go next. So then he went to the Under world to give him the goat and tell him were to go from there. Then he was washed on to Calipso's island, and she fed, and bath him and she wouldn't let him leave. So one of the gods said that she need to set him free or they will destroy her island, so she gave him some supplies to rebuild an boat so that he can be on his way. Odysseus son went to find him, and he could not find him no wear so he went back home to tell his mother not to get married cause his father is still alive. His mother told the men who ever can shout the arrow through all the holes and make the target, that he will be the next man she will be married to. They all tried but non of them could make it,so the old guy that Odysseus son brought in tried it and he made it then he changed in to Odysseus and killed all the men that was in that room. Odysseus went to see his wife and she was very happy to see him and they lived happily ever after.",

I felt sorry for her when Hermes played by Freddy Douglas forced her to let Odysseus free. Odysseus came across many creatures and gods. Most of the gods did not help Odysseus but one god did his name was Aeolus played by Michael J. Pollard. Aeolus was god of wind. Odysseus came across another god Circle played by Bernadette Peters. Circle was a witch. She got men to drink the Potion and it would turn them into animals. I think that the cast played there characters very good. They dressed like the people would in Ancient Greece . The women wore long flowing dresses. The men wore short tunics. The tunics were made from wool. They believed in many gods With there religion they would sacrifice goats for the gods. The movie was filmed in Greece so you would see what it looked like. There occupations were fishing, herding, warmer, sailors, and ship builders. One of the social lacks was to bring gifts for the person who was giving you food and shelter.",

    "review/text": "My Odyssey ReviewI watched the movie `The Odyssey', Directed by Andrei Konchalovck. I though it was a good movie, and described the adventures of Odysseus. It told about which gods helped him, and which gods did not help him. I thought that this movie was very historically correct. Their clothing was very authentic looking. I learned a lot watching it. I did not know that women did not have any rights back then, another thing that I did not know was that women had to cover their face when they went into public. I thought that it was interesting that the gods ate like pigs I thought they would be proper, I did not expect that. I did not know that you had to bring a gift to your host or hostess. My favorite scene was the big fight at the end with Odysseus and Telemecus against Euremacus and Perimides. I think that the best looking scene was where Poseidon talked to Odysseus through the water. I also like when Aeros gave Odysseus a bag of wind, and one of his men on the board opened it up. My favorite character was Circa, played by Bernadette Peters, I liked her in Pink Cadillac with Clint Eastwood. There would be only a few things I would change, I would have made it where not as many things were going on at the same time. There are also some little thing, but I won't list them. All in all I thought I was a good movie.",

During that time if you were a visitor you must bring a gift. He had many task on his way journey home. He ran into some troubling females. One in which was name Circe (Bernadetta Peters). When men went to see her if you drunk her wine you would turn into swine. But since a messenger came and warned him, and also gave him some grass to eat. Therefore he didn't turn into swine. He also ran into Calypso (Vanessa Williams), who kept him on her island for two years. That was the one most important hardest time that he faced with a women.By Seaunte",

    "review/text": "This movie, The Odyssey, was a wonderful movie. The main character was Odysseus. He was played by Armand Assante. His wife was Penelope, played as Greta Scacchi. It started out in 1300 B.C. The movie started out with his son, Telemachus, played as Alan Stenson. Then, Odysseus was sent out to fight in the Trojan War. The Greeks won. Before he left he told Penelope that she would have to promise him that if his son had grown a beard before he returned, then she must marry someone else. After ten years at the Trojan War, Odysseus and his men were headed back home to Ithica. Many different things happened to them on the way home. First of all, the God of the Wind, Aeolis, gives Odysseus bags of wind. A curious guy on the boat named Anticlus, played as William Houston, let out all the bad winds. The boat switched and headed another way. Hermes, the messenger god, told Odysseus and his men that the witch needed them. Hermes gave Odysseus leaves to eat to keep the curse away. Odysseus climbed the mountains to the castle of Circe. She turned Odysseus men to animals. She(Circe) fell in love with Odysseus. She made him sleep with her, and it ends up he stays there for five years. After that, they got into their boat, and rode it into the Underworld. He sees his mother in the Underworld. In the Underworld, he went to see the blind phrophet. The phrophet tells Odysseus that he will fo fight two bad creatures, the Silla and the Curiptus. They meet up with Silla(mythological creature). It had several heads. It looked like a giant worm with heads and teeth. The Curiptus had a big mouth. The Curiptus shut its mouth and spewed water on everyone. Odysseus fell into the water. Back home, Penelope, was making a death shawl just in case Odysseus didn't come back. Her idea was to thread all day, and take it back out at night time. Then, it would be longer before he would have to choose another man to marry. Then, Odysseus ended up at some sort of place in the middle of the ocean. The lady, Calypso, played as Vanessa Williams. She kept him there for two more years, but then she was sad, because she had to let him go. He headed back home to Ithica. On the way, Odysseus met up with Poseidon, God of Sea. He(Poseidon) had been trying to teach Odysseus a lesson. Poseidon told him that if it wasn't for gods or goddesses, then humans wouldn't be here. Back home, Penelope and Odysseus mother were sqeezing olives to make olive oil. Finally,Odysseus makes it back home to Ithica. A lady there turns him to look like an older guy. Only his son, Tiresias, could recognize him. The men waiting for Penelope's hand in marriage were getting ready to find out who her next husband was. Odysseus sat back watching. The men had to shoot an arrow through twelve hoops. No one could do it except Odsseus. Then, all of a sudden Odysseus stepped u and shot the arrow through all twelve of the hoops. He turned back into his old self again. He killed all of those men. Odysseus and his family lived happily ever after. In this movie, my favorite character was Calypso played as Vanessa Williams. She played it really good. I felt sorry for her, because she had to let Odysseus go back home to Ithica.",

Although the plot follows a chronological order (including even a concise narrative-with-highlights condensation of the Trojan War), rather than the in-medias-res order of the poem, the overall world of Homer's classic hero is conveyed not only by the gorgeous Mediterranean film locations but also by the daily activities of the bronze-age Hellene, such as sacrifice to and commune with the gods, which play such an important part in the ethical world of the original, since as Homer's classic notes, \"All men need the gods\" (3.48), a statement which the film dramatically iterates when Odysseus most eagerly entreats the sea god Poseidon to help him \"understand.\" Also significant is how the film notes the sway which the gods hold over such pertinent issues herein as guest relations, which in the original, Odysseus makes known to the brutal Cyclops, saying, \"Respect the Gods! . . . strangers are sacred--Zeus will avenge their rights!\" (9.269-71), to which the Cyclops responds, \"I'd never spare you in fear of Zeus's hatred\" (9.277-78). Perhaps most important though is the relationship between Odysseus and Athena, the protectress, who never forsook Odysseus, as \"He followed in her footsteps--man and Goddess\" (2.406). The film adds grace to the belief that her divine favor was bestowed on this \"man of twists and turns,\" the archetypal epic adventurer who, through his loyalty, bravery and ingenuity, proves himself worthy of such divine intervention.",

Of course the movie will never be as good as the book, however, this goes entirely beyond that. The producers of this movie should be glad that Homer is long dead because I can assure you he, and any other Ancient Greek for that matter, would wreak absolute hell on them. As a lover of Greek Mythology, I was grossly appalled and frankly, I was offended that the makers of this movie believed I was dumb enough to take this movie as what The Odyssey was truly about. We the audience deserve a higher standard of entertainment and if not that at least the consideration to leave the foundation of Western literature to stand alone. If this rating gives anyone even the slightest clue of how I feel, then my point has been well conveyed. If you've never seen this movie, I have several things for you to consider before doing so. First, don't read the book, or prepare to be as outraged as I was at the misinformed atrocities so readily displayed as fact in the movie. Second, you must be able to appreciate hand-me-down special effects and budget cuts because that's all you're going to see in this film. Last, if you haven't read the book don't take this movie as fact and a correct representation because looking at the movie objectively, it does not follow the book accurately. Choose wisely before renting this movie and think hard about whether or not you want to subject your innocent children to watching Hollywood destroy the story on which it was built. Thank you, read the Honors Kids' reviews for further detail on the book compared to the movie.P.S. It has been considered immature to mock another for their name, Mr. C., and you are certainly no one to talk. You disgrace Pennsylvania in your lack of tolerance for other people's differences. Maybe you should get out more often and find out just how many people have last names different than your own.

    "review/text": "Ok, first of all Mr.Cmndrnineveh from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA I find it very hard to believe that you even read the full book version of THE ODYSSEY. God knows if you did you wouldnt be madly in love with this made-for-TV movie THE ODYSSEY. Personally i think the only ppl this movie does good too are druggies and wanna-be drop outs who dont want to read the book or buy the cliff notes so they watch the movie. its absolutley horrible. Mr. Noteboom is a very bright and brillant honors teacher in Washington state. I must say i agree with every honor student's last year review of this book. To the point where Telemachous was whiny and horrible; Athena had blue eyes; and Menelaos' hair is black. All i gotta say is what a waste of film! Ppl out there- spare yourself.",

    "review/text": "Okay, I may or may not have some original things to point out about this movie. First off the only reason I gave it one star (besides the fact you can't give it zero) is because it was wikid funny because of how stupid it was, and because Mr. Noteboom did the Telemachos voice (cranky, whiny, english school boy voice). Alright, Poseidon, the \"god of the wine-dark sea\" creative use of quotes from Homers smash hit epic, but still very stupid. A rolling face on a wave that doesn't crash for three minutes.......NO BAAAAAAD. Lets see theres Scylla, I am helping to make a better Scylla then the one in the movie.....well it wasn't that bad......but still ours is better. Then there was the whole thing with Charybdis being AFTER Scylla, instead of beside it, I mean, it....kinda ruins a bit of the effect. I would also like to quote Mr. Noteboom and say that when you are begging for Odysseus' men to be sucked up by Charbdis...sumthing is drastically wrong! I have to admit Aeleous is awesome, but he is dipicted way wrong, hes still awesome though. Oh and what about Penelope testing Odysseus, that is so great, and they didn't even put it in there. Finally, how do I put this lightly......I can't they need to learn to pronounce names the same EVERY Time, it bugs me when all of a sudden Telemachos is being pronounced Telemacus and then telemauchos........just aint doin it for me. Also theres this big burly greek warrior just getting back from the Trojan war, and hes using phrases like \"rosy fingertipped dawn\" and all of these poetic terms.....lets just say he must feel very secure in his manlyhood. Anyway horrible movie, don't watch it expecting to be seeing what goes on in the book in a good way. If you want a good laugh and to be able to complain that they totally DID NOT do justice to the book, watch it.....maybe you'll be able to get a few laughs. See ya'll lata!",

    "review/text": "As a part of teaching 7th graders ancient Greek history every spring, I have the privilege of introducing to them Homer's &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;. They think they know what real adventure is till they learn about Odysseus' grand voyage home from the Trojan War. And then--when we watch this movie, the students have a much greater appreciation not only for real adventure, but real literature!Filmed on location around the Mediterranean, the film captures the perilous journey of Odysseus back to Ithica and his beloved Penelope. The glaring weakness of the script is attempting to condense the Trojan War into a half-hour. Nevertheless, Achilles' slaughter of Hector is awesome, and after all--the film isn't titled 'The Iliad'.While the 7th graders enjoy the mysterious Aeolus (and his bag of winds), and less so Vanessa Williams' seductive Calypso (which gets a bit 'steamy'), there is simply nothing to compare to two scenes. First, the Scylla and Charybdis, which evoke all the surprise, blood, and special effects which today's teenager expects (without overdoing any of the three), and second, the concluding sequence where Odysseus is revealed to the wicked suitors who have &quot;...stolen (his) world&quot;, and violated the most sacred of ancient Greek customs--hospitality. The bloodletting here is intense, but Homer would certainly have applauded the interpretation presented.Not all of Odysseus' ten adventures are included in the film. For example, we do not see the lotus-eaters, the slaughter of the cattle of Helius, the rescue by the sea nymph Ino, etc. But what we do see is wonderful! One will never forget the belching and monstrous cyclops who (again) pictures for us the unavoidable punishment Greeks felt was certain to befall the inhospitable! Also missing is the death of Odysseus' faithful dog Argos upon beholding his master's return.Finally, also missing is what would have been a great visual scene--Odysseus bound to the mast of his ship as he experienced the wonder of the deadly sirens' call--and lived to tell about it! I also found it just a bit disconcerting that although we see King Menelaus of Sparta, we see nothing of his wife Helen whose beautiful 'face launched a thousand ships' and started the whole darn Trojan War in the first place. And where is Paris...? (Oh yes, I forgot again--this is &quot;The Odyssey&quot;!)For me, the highlight is Odysseus' trip to the underworld to seek the blind prophet's direction on how to get back home. Though combining two of four rivers of the underworld into one (the Styx, and the Phlegethon--river of fire), the sequence loses none of the magical mystery of the Greek conception of the afterlife. Even included is the haunting meeting of Odysseus and his mother who committed suicide, in believing her son would never come home.Bernadette Peters' Circe sequence is as humerous as it is clever, and watching Odysseus' men turn back into men from animals is memorable. Nevertheless, character development is often sacrificed at the expense of trying to cover the many adventures, but I guess one can't have it both ways!The special effects are great--especially the face of Poseidon in the waves as he strives to punish Odysseus for blinding his son (the cyclops), and (as one of my students pointed out)in reality, ends up making our hero a better man, by crushing his hubris, and teaching him the ultimate Greek lesson: &quot;...man is nothing without the gods!&quot;Great movie! Whether they know the classic tale or not, the film will entertain teenagers (and most everyone else). But as a supplement to teaching the great literature pieces of Homer...ah, it doesn't get any better than this! Now, if the same director would only make &quot;The Iliad&quot;....",

    "review/summary": "Ancient Adventure",
    "review/text": "After watching this movie, I realized how tedious it would have been if the director had filmed feast after feast or all the details of the original story. He focused more on the adventures. Listening to 11 compact discs to hear the entire story is quite an odyssey itself, so if you don't have a lot of time, the movie will save you a few hours.The recording is about 12.5 hours in comparison with 165 minutes for the movie. There are many differences between the movie and the recorded book version. For one, Odysseus' son leaves to look for his father early in the original story and in the movie, he seems to leave much later. The movie focuses more on the suitors and sailors.The adventures of Odysseus are dramatic, exciting and interesting even to a contemporary audience. It is a story of a great warrior who is cursed by the gods and must wander the seas for years after the Trojan War.It is also a story of how a man wishes to return home to his faithful wife all while he is \"forced\" to enjoy the pleasures of the islands. Although goddesses of great beauty take care of him in the islands, he does not seem to really enjoy being away from home.Odysseus seems to have a girlfriend on every island and yet we forgive him and admire his wife. While he is enjoying the pleasures of the islands, his wife sits at home defending her very existence from a group of suitors bent on pursuing her to the end of time.When considering a critical analysis of this movie, I had to look at the \"acting\" and \"special effects.\" There is beautiful scenery in Turkey and of course you have ships at sea and goddesses and gods causing havoc with the humans. Some of the more complex scenes were filmed in Malta. This was where they had a huge tank set up for the sea adventures. What they did with the special effects is pretty impressive.The acting gets better as the story progresses. What you will notice is some \"overacting\" when the characters emphasis their emotions so strongly that the effect only causes you to laugh. Imagine a bunch of wrestlers hugging and crying. Yes, that funny. You should not be laughing when characters are crying, however, that is the effect because the overplaying of emotions becomes almost comical.Andrei Konchalovsky's obviously had a vision for how he wanted the emotions to be played out onscreen although I think he dipped too far into extravagance and the viewer might consider it more insincere than tragic. However, if you consider how the individuals really might have acted, this is perhaps more true to ancient life. It is true that in the original Odyssey, men cry pitifully (passionate sobbing) and show their feminine side freely.I especially loved seeing all the gods and goddesses in the movie. I loved Isabella Rossellini as the \"clear eyed\" goddess Athena. She was definitely a highlight in this movie. It seems she is rather fond of Odysseus, the king of Ithaca (Armand Assante) and with a twinkle in her eye, she sends him off to be brave. Her eyes are just amazingly beautiful in this movie. Some of the goddesses in this movie had dark hair and in the original they were \"fair-haired\" goddesses.There is a creative use of waves to display the anger of Poseidon when Odysseus doesn't give the gods credit for his successes. He is cursed and must wander on the ocean until the end of time.Another highlight is the horse and ships. The Trojan Horse makes its appearance and is very well made, as are all the ships which were built in England. You will also be amazed by the special effects in Hades. As Odysseus descends into \"hell/Hades\" he is almost overwhelmed with the heat.Some of the most bloody scenes I've ever seen occur in this movie, although they are not quite \"horror.\" Imagine bodies being gobbled up by hungry sea creature and blood splattering on a wooden deck or a Cyclops tearing a body apart to devour it. Because it happens during the daytime, the effect is not as intense.The scenes in Troy are also fairly violent. There is also a fairly long scene at the end where men are locked up in a room and systematically slaughtered. This is for revenge so seems to have a point.What I kept waiting for was a scene where Odysseus is bound to the ship's mast as the sirens call to him and his men. This is a very short section in the original story, so they must have felt it was not as significant. However, it would have been spectacular on film.Recommended to those who love Greek Mythology or who want to have a visual reference in your mind when ready or listening to the translation of The Odyssey by Homer.If you are trying to decide if you like the Odyssey or the Iliad: The ending of the Odyssey is much more romantic and there is far more romance and beauty in the Odyssey. The Iliad ending will appeal more to men and the story seems to contain more \"war\" violence and has a much more definite focus on war.Main message of this movie seems to be: \"Man is nothing without the gods\" or \"never give up on your dream no matter if the gods try to stop you, you are captain of your fate in the end.\"The movie is more entertaining than listening to 12.5 hours of an Audio Book, yet if you watch the movie and then listen to the Audio Book, it takes on a new meaning. You then have a visual reference for all the adventure sections. I can recommend the movie for that aspect alone.~The Rebecca Review",

    "review/text": "THE ODYSSEY is based in the book THE ODYSSEY by Homer. It tells the exciting tale of Odysseus, the king of Ithaca, who, on the day of his son's birth, was called to fight in the Trojan War. However, the movie is not about Odysseus fighting in the Trojan War. The real plot begins when Odysseus begins his journey home after the war. As the war ended, Odysseus happened to anger a very vengeful god named Poseidon, who is the god of the sea. Poseidon decided to make Odysseus' journey home as miserable as possible. Now Odysseus must make it home to Ithaca while avoiding Poseidon's wrath. During his long, hard journey, Odysseus and his crew encounter many strange creatures. Some creatures are friendly and try to help Odysseus and his men. Others are not friendly and try to destroy Odysseus and prevent him from reaching Ithaca. Here are some of the main characters: Odysseus:The mighty king of Ithaca and main character of the story.(Armand Assante) Penelope:Odysseus' beloved wife who waits patiently for his return.(Greta Scacchi) Athena:Odysseus' guardian god who guides him in times of need and gives him helpful advice.(Isabella Rosselini) Circe:Odysseus was unlucky to run into this woman. After someone drinks her magical honey wine, she turns them into swine.(Bernadette Peters) Calypso:Another unfourtunate accident of Odysseus' was running into Calypso. She kept him on her island for two whole years!(Vanessa Williams)THE ODYSSEY has a very strong visual impact on the audience that watches it. It is full of action and suspense and the special effects are amazing, especially the scene where Poseidon was speaking to Odysseus through the waves. Also, the acting and costumes were realistic. The actors talked and wore clothes that were worn in that time. The soundtrack is also realistic to that time, The music on the soundtrack is mostly old Greek music.Overall, I give THE ODYSSEY five stars.",

    "review/text": "I saw this movie in my social studies class. I thought it was going to be boring, I mean, we were in school, but it was great! It was an excellent movie, great for learning and amusement. The scenes from the war were very gory, but seemed VERY realistic, I thought it was cool. If you didnt know, the Odyssey is based on the epic poem by Homer. It begins with a reference to the Iliad at the Trojan War, a ten year mythical war between Troy and Ithica, to give you background into the story. It's mainly about Odysseus long journey home back to Ithaca to see his wife and son. Little does he know, that insulting the great god,Poseidon, will make his journey even longer and harder. The Odyssey also references many Greek gods. Gods played an important and unique role in everyday Greek life. Odysseus personal god was Athena. She helps him and his son with Odysseus journey home. The clothes in the movie were awesomely realistic. Original clothing of the Greeks were made out of linen. Ordinary people usually wore white clothes, but the wealthy would wear elaborate colorful robes. The movie also showed Odysseus crops and herds of sheep. They both played a vital role in their life. Sheep gave milk, food, and clothing. Olives, the main crop of Ithaca, made olive oil. You can see Penelope(Odysseus wife,played by Greta Scacchi) pressing them to make oil in the movie. These were the main sources of food for the people of Ithica, and they were very important in their lives. I thought that the director did a good job making everything in the movie look realistic. Mythology comes alive when you hear the roar of Posiedons voice, the wail of the Cyclops(Reid Asaita) as he is blinded by &Ograve;Nobody&Oacute;, and the flicker of the bright-gloomy flames of the under world. I thought the movie was excellent! Enjoy it,youll love it!",

    "review/text": "The Odyssey tells the story of Odysseus, the King of Ithaca who, on the very day of his son's birth is called away to the Trojan War. Forced to leave his son, his kingdom and his beloved wife Penelope behind, Odysseus fights the ten year siege of Troy, which finally ends when he comes up with the idea of the Trojan Horse, which gets him and his men inside the citadel.With Troy finally defeated, Odysseus is free to sail home, but mistakenly insults the god of the sea - Poseidon, who vows he'll never return home. For the next ten years, Odysseus and his men voyage home, but come face to face with many dangers on the way. As you may have guessed - it's a very long movie, and since it drags a bit through some parts, it may be best not to try and watch it in one big go.However, it does have it's merits - good scenery, costumes, special effects and acting, but standing out for me are the preformances of all the women, and their individual relationships with Odysseus (adequately played by Armand Assante) There is the goddess of wisdom Athene (Isabella Rossellini) who appoints herself as Odysseus's protecter, Anticlea (Irene Papas) Odysseus's fierce mother, Eurycleia (Geraldine Chaplin) Odyssues's nurse who cares for his son and is loyal to both of them, the witch Circe (Bernadette Peters) who uses potions, charms and magic to bend Odysseus to her will, and Calypso (Vannessa Williams) the nymph who claims Odysseus for her own when he lands on her island. But standing out even more is Penelope (Greta Scacchi) Odysseus's devoted wife who manages the kingdom, raises their son and keeps the many suitors who come seeking her hand at bay in her husband's absence. She is an inspiring woman, who maintains her dignity and strength throughout, and trying never to give up hope that her husband maay still be alive. The most powerful scenes of the entire show do not centre around Odysseus at all, but Penelope, helplessly trapped in her own home as the suitors take over. Watch out especially for the scene in which she tries to stop her mother-in-law from committing suicide, and when the leader of the suitors Eurymachus (Eric Robert) attempts to seduce her. &quot;They will have none of Odysseus's things,&quot; she says. &quot;Not his kingdom and *not* his wife.&quot;I watch this movie, not as much for Odysseus's adventures, but for the strength of the female characters around him.",

Even though some of the monsters are clearly the stuff of lower-budget Hollywood, the acting is noteworthy, and the coverage of the epic as a whole is well-executed. (Covering a story of this magnitude in two hours is no small feat.) Students who struggle with the language of the epic enjoy this visual representation, and it also makes for a good comparison/contrast to the epic, as many scenes are presented differently than they are in the text. For example, the movie moves chronologically, whereas much of the epic is told as flashback. Certain scenes--such as the death of Odysseus's men on Helios's island and Penelope's test of the bed at the end--are omitted, while others--such as the Lotus Eaters and the witch-goddess Circe--are combined. Additionally, the movie portrays Odysseus much more positively and much less flawed than the epic. But all of this makes for excellent discussion with my students, and that's what matters to me. Beyond educational purposes, the movie is fast-paced and enjoyable. Highly recommended.",

    "review/summary": "A fairly faithful and entertaining mini-series adaptation of Homer's epic poem \"The Odyssey\"",
    "review/text": "In my Classical Mythology class my students have an opportunity to write a paper comparing the recent theatrical film \"Troy\" to not only Homer's \"Iliad\", but all of the other classical sources regarding the story of the Trojan War. Students find plenty of differences between the ancient stories and the film and the same would be true if they were to look at the recent mini-series version of \"Helen of Troy\" or any of the old movies that dealt with the Trojan War. Students then have to evaluate the differences and similarities to render a judgment as to whether \"Troy\" is an appropriate adaptation of Homer and the others. You would think that a similar paper could be written regarding this television mini-series version of Homer's epic poem \"The Odyssey,\" but it would not be worthwhile because this is the most faithful adaptation of Homer to date. Yes, to anyone familiar with the original text there are differences. For example, when Odysseus comes home his faithful dog does not drop dead and Penelope does not test him regarding the bed with the headboard made from a tree, but I always thought that last one was a bit much given everything he had just done to prove he was Odysseus come home at last.When it comes to Homer I maintain there are \"Odysseus\" people and there are \"Iliad\" people, and I am firmly ensconced in the latter camp. This is not only because I found the character of Achilles and his wrath to be more interesting, but also because what I thought was the best part of \"The Odyssey,\" the ten years of adventures that kept Odysseus lost, were the shortest part of the epic. But the teleplay by Christopher Solimine and director Andrei Konchalovsky (\"Tango and Cash\") takes care of that concern as the visits by Odysseus (Armand Assante) to the islands of the Cyclops (Reid Asato), Circe (Bernadette Peters), Calypso (Vanessa Williams), and the rest assume a greater part of the narrative. Meanwhile, back at home Odysseus's queen Penelop (Greta Sacchi) has to put up with all of the suitors who want to marry here and take the throne of Ithaca since they believe Odysseus to be dead, and their son Telemachus (Alan Stenson) goes off on a journey to prove his father is still alive.While Jim Henson's creature shop creates the mythical monsters for Odysseus and his men to encounter, what is more important is that Assante's character reeks of hubris. Not only does he stand on the shore thumping his chest and proclaiming he is greater than the gods for having brought down Troy through the stratagem of the Trojan Horse, he continues to thumb his nose at Poseidon even as things get worse and worse. The scene where I decided to round up on my ranking for this mini-series is when Odysseus is floating in he sea being buffeted by waves sent by Poseidon and the arrogance that has doomed him and his crew to ten years of wandering and death are beaten out of him. Odysseus was not a hero to the ancient Greeks, who considered him more of a pirate than anything else (remember, the first thing he does on the way home from Troy is to stop and raid a village). His is wily Odysseus from start to finish, but Assante is given a character arc to play and he follows through with it. His love for his wife and his son are core to his character as well, and while I questioned this particular bit of casting when I first heard of it, Assante does make a convincing Odyssues. There are no problems accepting Scacchi as the personification of faithfulness in Penelope and having Irene Papas show up as Anticlea, the mother of Odysseus was a nice casting decision.For me the most problematic element in the mini-series is the performance of Alan Stenson as Telemachus, although Michael J. Pollard as Aeolus the Bronx god of the winds was a bit much even with the nudge-nudge wink-wink way he is presented. But Telemachus rants and raves too much as the headstrong kid who refuses to believe the father he has grown up without is still alive. I should really not be enjoying it when he gets beaten to a pulp, but notice that before his father tells him the right time has come for him to be agree, this kid is pretty much frothing at the mouth. The recounting of the Trojan War is reductionalistic in the extreme and they gloss over the story of how Agamemnon got the king of Ithaca to go to war when Odysseus was pretending to be insane and plowing a field with salt, but these are legitimate choices given that the focus is on Homer's poem and not the attendant myths.Granted, the story of \"The Odyssey\" is told here as pure entertainment, which is seen not only when Calypso turns one of Odysseus's soldiers into a talking pig and during the slaying of the suitors when they go flying through the air when hit by arrows and spears, but in the (predominantly) playful way the gods are presented. Poseidon is the exception since he is really, really ticked off at our hero, but Hermes (Freddy Douglas) is certainly mischievous, and gray-eyed Athena is certainly played with a twinkle in the blue-eyes of Isabella Rossellini (who I thought actually could have been in the story a bit more). I also thought that giving Eurymachus (Eric Roberts) more to do as the spokesperson for the suitors was a good move. All things considered, it is amazing how faithful this telling is to Homer given how much fun they have in telling the tale and with such low expectations going in \"The Odyssey\" certainly exceeds them.",

    "review/text": "OdysseySarah Wilcox, Goochland Virginia 8th Grade When somebody says something about an educational video, you dont really think of the movie as interesting, or something that you would want to watch again in your free time. Well, I have a perfect example of a movie that is not boring at all, and is something that I would love to watch again in my spare time. I recently viewed the movie the Odyssey. The Odyssey is one of Homers epics. The Odyssey tells the story of Odysseus and his trip home from the Trojan War. The Trojan war lasted for 10 years and when Odysseus and his men were on their trip home they encounter many horrible things. Odysseus eventually arrives home to Ithica after 20 long hard years. I wont tell you what happens, or all of the details, because I dont want to spoil the movie for you. I believe that the director couldnt have picked better actors. I think that they played their roles very well and really made their characters personalitys come to life. The special effects were wonderful. The underworld special effects really let you get a good picture in your mind of what they underworld was betrayed to be like. The monster special effects were also very good, it really made you fell like you were being eaten by the monster too. The movie really helped me to get a better understanding of what the Odyssey was all about. I think the Odyssey was a great movie, and that Homer would be very proud.",

When I heard a mini-series of the Odyssey was being created I was anxious for two reasons; I was dying to see it and was terrified of how badly it was going to be butchered. This was a delightful surprise.To my amazement the writers took some minor literary license with the story but all in all it worked. What is even better...it was a lot of fun to watch. I would recommend that anyone thinking about buying this do so... but also buy the book. Turn your brain off watch the movie, engage the brain again and read the original story. Either way you are promised a good time.",

    "review/text": "The movie THE ODYSSEY was interesting and informative, though the set decoration and special effects were a bit low-budget. Greta Scacchi and Armand Assanti are very well cast and they are both fine actors. My favorite part of THE ODYSSEY was the scene in which Odysseus shows his son, Telemachus, their island and their home shortly after he was born. There were also several other interesting parts to this movie. In addition, there were several good special effects to make this movie more interesting, and add to it a taste of science fiction, and Greek mythology. All in all, I would reccommend this movie to anyone who, first of all, has alot of time to kill, and second of all, is curious about the ways of Ancient Greece, or to someone who just wants to watch a high-action movie with a happy ending.",

    "review/text": "I thought that the movie The Odyssey was great. It starts off kind of confusing, but follows the poem by Homer closely. My two favorite mythological characers were Scylla and Carybdis who wrecked Odysseus's ship. I thought the best scene was when Odysseus shot the arrow through twelve battle-axes and the other men saw he was really Odysseus. Also, when Poseidon took his anger out on Odysseus on his way home. This was really an awesome and interest catching movie. I thought Isabella Rosellini did a great job as Athena and the director did an awesome job capturing poseidon's wrath over Odysseus in the turbulent waters. The director and actors did an excellent job depicting the mythological beasts, gods, and goddesses. All in all I give this movie 5 stars.",

    "review/text": "This movie, The Odyssey was a wonderful way of telling about Odysseus and his journey. I would highly recommend this movie. The cast was great. Vanessa Williams played Calypso perfectly. She made me feel sorry for her when she had to let Odysseus go. This funny little Aeolus, the god of the wind was my favorite character. Though he was a bit part, he was one of the few gods who actually helped Odysseus. The special effects were the best I've seen in a movie for school. The monsters were so life like. The way they showed the underworld was unbelievable. It was so bright and real looking. The gods and goddesses looked exactly like you would usually picture them. That's why I liked this movie so much. The reasons I didn't like it were few and small. I would have put more of the Trojan war in it. The little the director, Andrei Konchalovsky, put of the war really didn't tell the story that well. The only other thing against it was the fact that I didn't like Odysseus's mother. Irene Papas played her well but the character was mean. However that's the only reason I didn't like this movie. So all in all I'd give it two thumbs up.",

Although it focuses on only the most famous portions of Homer's epic and oversimplifies some of Odysseus's internal struggles, this film captures the spirit of The Odyssey and will help introduce a new generation to the Cyclops, Scylla, and a host of sexy enchantresses. Armand Assante embodies Odysseus--his swaggering bravado, his compassion for his men, his longing for home--and the effects are pretty impressive for a television adaptation. Great for teachers as a companion to the text: this film offers enough context to help make the epic poem accessible to struggling readers. Some graphic violence, and a few passionate scenes (though only one is truly awkward), but certainly less violent than the text itself. It's not a cinematic triumph, and won't be adored by those who already love The Odyssey, but it will draw in those who are new to the stories of brave Odysseus, master mariner and soldier.",

For Bugsy,I wish the movie had coveredmore of his early life (his rise) and cut back on some of the later material(less of Jack Dragna and Hollywood). Snatch was a bit difficult to get a grip on withits close mix of comedy and crime. In this it bears a close resemblance to CottonComes to Harlem.Please see the reviews of the individual DVDs for more details.",

Even John Belushi's imitation of him has lost some of its punch for we aren't accustomed to seeing the two-ton powerhouse flail spastically, his head bobbing up and down towards the skies, then back to the footlights, on our stages on a regular basis. Be that as it may, Cocker's comeback didn't really take. \"Across From Midnight\" is a sturdy enough tune but it won't set young hearts afire--middle aged ones either, and I don't think you'll harm yourself by skipping forward this one on the DVD.The amazing this is the power this man generates at age 55. Mehtinks he'll be going this way at age 80, astonishing when we thought he would never live till he his 30th birthday. He seemed like one of those mutant freaks like Rondo Hatton born to have an early disabling death. And here he is still going strong when seemingly healhier specimens have long retired or even gone to their graves to push up the daisies.I always thought putting Joe Cocker in THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA would be a good idea.He has the angelic beast sounds that you need for a good rousing rendition of MUSIC OF THE NIGHT.Here he moans his way through CRY ME A RIVER with much of the power of the old days, and puts Leon Russell in the shade with his majestic, tormented DELTA LADY, which he might try reviving now for Katrina Relief, I think it would go down a storm. I saw him in 2002 and he had sensibly enough dropped the failed \"Across from Midnight\" from his set list and was once agaion concentrating on the old tried and trues like THE LETTER, UP WHERE WE BELONG, SUMMER IN THE CITY and of course, WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS. More power to him and long may he gargle!",

The good news is that he is surrounded by a solid band and a couple of animated female singers. The instrumental parts in Cocker's songs now give it the vital energy he used to have. His songs are still very listenable, from his \"Mad Dogs and Englishman\" days to the present.Give him credit: he's still introducing new material, unlike a lot of other '60s performers. One of them: \"Into The Mystic\"\" is a very nice piece.The capacity crowd is with him all the way and helps generate a little excitement, too.",

The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout &quot;ENGAGE&quot; rather than &quot;THERE SHE BLOWS&quot;.For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text.

Through the duration of his personal hunt, Ahab acknowledges nary a thought of responsibility or regard to his ship and crew. Directed by Franc Roddam (who also adapted Melville's novel for this screen version) rearranges many of the sequences of events from the book, and even mixes up the dialougue between the characters in some spots. Nevertheless, despite these odd changes, Roddam's effort is an entertaining piece of work. Patrick Stewart is simply remarkable in his portrayal of Ahab. Ted Levine, Henry Thomas, and Hugh Keays-Byrne also turn in fine performances. Originally aired on USA Network as a three-hour miniseries. The DVD version of this movie comes in at 145 minutes. The first VHS edition had a running length of 120 minutes and was later re-released at 145 minutes. Gregory Peck, who played Captain Ahab in John Huston's 1956 film version of the novel won a Golden Globe Award here for his cameo role as Father Mapple.",

Or maybe it's that weird Chinese harpooner who looks like Fu-Man-Chu. Perhaps it is the script, which is -depending on what version you get to see- either too long or too short, and takes too many liberties with the book; hindrances that add little to the plot and only serve to enrage the Melville purists.Shame, for I think the cast is above average. Patrick Stewart makes a believable Ahab and Henry Thomas a splendid Ishmael. Ted Levine deserves special praise as Mr. Starbuck, and even Piripi Waretini's Queequeg (his annoying \"blahhhh!!!\" notwithstanding) rings true to character. As the cherry crowning the cake, Gregory Peck evokes warm memories in the patriarchal role of Father Mapple.And yet... I dunno; maybe the entire trip was cursed from the beginning.

    "review/text": "This version certainly does not compare to the other version of Moby Dick, the 1956 version with Gregory Peck starring as the captain bent on revenge. Problems amount with this updated version mainly because it seems to be an attempt at dumbing down or stripping the story to make it more accessible to a wider audience. In making this happen, the producers seemingly beat us over the head with Ishmael's simplicity, Ahab's madness, Starbuck's reluctance and nonconformity, and Queequeg's cartoonishness. The ultimate result is a version which constructs the story accurately, but in a bare-bones way; we are left without much of the depth that Melville's novel depicts.Still, with my reservations ( mainly because I do teach English literature), this is a version that does have some entertainment value and certainly gives some accurate information to both the characters and the story. There are some enlightening and funny scenes, such as the first meeting between Ishmael and Queequeg in the sleeping quarters and the scene with Queequeg answering for Ishmael as they board the Pequod. Starbuck's character is successfully depicted as a man who reluctantly goes with the mission of hunting the white whale despite his longing to return safe and sound home. As others have noted, Patrick Stewart illustrates Captain Ahab a little over-the-top in terms of his mental balance, but he does have a certain feel to the Ahab we encounter in the novel: he is quick to judge, narrow-minded, revengeful, and unrelenting, and Stewart embodies all of these characteristics in his portrayal.Understandably, a two-hour movie cannot illustrate the depth at which the actual book works. We don't really get the chance to scrutinize the magnitude of Ahab's vengeance, his opposition to the laws of nature, and the essence of this futile voyage of revenge. Still, for what its worth, this film does have some credibility and merit, and certainly can be used as a tool for both Melville and the novel itself. And, if those aren't your cup of tea, it still has entertainment and moments that make it worthy of viewing. This is Moby Dick and Melville, but stripped a bit down.3 1/2 stars",

I remember watching the concert on &quot;In Concert&quot; way back in the 70's. I even audio taped it on cassett, as it was aired on radio at the same time. No, the stupid echo effects were not on that version, Mick Ronson's guitar work (I miss that guy), was in front and smokin'! Who thought of mixing Ronson's ax just about out of the concert in the first place. To top it all off, Jeff Beck came out near the end of the show and played Jean Jeanie with the band An unbelivable walk on, just blew the roof off the place, you would never know it though since it is left off all video productions.Does anyone know when the REAL VERSION (What was released for the &quot;In Concert&quot; show on ABC) production would come out. It must be somewhere.",

    "review/text": "This 1973 concert film directed by D.A. Pennebaker (Monterey Pop, Jimi Plays Monterey, Depeche Mode 101, etc.) documenting the final show of Ziggy Stardust (David Bowie) & the Spiders from Mars (Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder, & Mick \"Woody\" Woodmansey)provides a rare glimpse into Bowie's glam rock period. It is a loud & flashy assault on the senses that is experienced through both \"sound\" & \"vision\". Film footage mostly consists of the performance, but also included are back stage scenes of Bowie changing from one costume to another.Songs performed:1) Hang on to yourself2) Ziggy Stardust3) Watch that man4) Medley: Wild eyed boy from Freecloud/All the young dudes/Oh you pretty things5) Moonage Daydream6) Changes7) Space Oddity8) My death9) Crack'd Actor10) Time11) Width of a circle12) Let's spend the night together13) Suffragette City14) White light/white heat15) Rock & Roll SuicideLeonard Maltin dismisses this film as \"practically unwatchable and unlistenable\" which would only be true for people who either dislike Bowie or the style of music. Yes, the music is sometimes loud, the focus is blurry here & there, and the strobe lights go crazy, but this is a David Bowie rock concert from the 1970s, isnt that appropriate? Anyone who is interested in either David Bowie or the glam rock era of the 1970s will find this film essential. For one, it is the only film document of David Bowie's Ziggy/glam phase and for another it is the \"last concert\" with \"the Spiders\" including Mick Ronson, who was a part of Bowie's band since the 1969 album \"Space Oddity\" up until '73's \"Pin Ups\". Bowie would, by 1974, have a new back up band, as well as a new look. This film deserves preservation on DVD as the historical document that it is.*Look quickly for Ringo Starr talking with Bowie backstage",

But since I like Bowie I bought it anyhow, expecting something no better than a bootleg. Well, I've seen plenty of bootlegs and this is nowhere near that poor. In fact, it's AMAZING. Yes, the sound quality isn't the best, but it's perfectly listenable. And, yes, the camerawork is a bit spasmodic and grainy, but that only adds to the gritty mood. Glam rock is SUPPOSED to be a bit trashy. If you want sleek, overproduced Bowie, then look elsewhere. But if you want Bowie at his best, then you can't miss this one. Watching this concert film you enter a ZONE and don't leave it till the end. This is Bowie at his best. Every now and then, Bowie flashes a killer smile, and that's because he knows he's onto something good. The music is some of the best rock ever recorded. The atmosphere is electric. Throughout the concert, Bowie is in THE ZONE, the audience is in THE ZONE -- and, if you don't expect polished concert footage, you will be, too.",

    "review/text": "It's 1973, in Hammersmith, London. Platformed teenagers in bell bottoms with blue hair and moons painted on their faces gather in civilised lines outside the converted cinema for what was a truly great concert. Although glam rock was far from the only teen movement in London at the time, this film makes it seem the most important. The first section of the film, and that with the clearest images, focuses on the fans outside the Hammersmith Odeon and Ziggy in the dressing room. Once the Spiders from Mars and Ziggy arrive on stage the atmosphere is electric. Some might miss the stereo of modern recordings, but the inferior sound quality somehow adds to the drama of the moment... for those who are eager to witness such a concert. Then there are the theatrics of Ziggy on stage - something never since emulated to the same degree. The concert is a seminal event both for Bowie's development as a performer, for glam rock (and then punk) as a movement, and for today's fans who only wish they had been there. If you have invested in a DVD player, then this film should definitely not be your first purchase. As other reviews testify, the picture and sound quality is poor; but then there are modern Bowie concerts with higher production values available. If you are keen to see what Ziggy was really like, however, it is well worth the money. Listen to the albums on your CD player, watch the modern concerts on your DVD player and watch this for the sheer spectacle. If you love Bowie and crave a closer view of his most acclaimed period, this is invaluable.",

    "review/text": "I recommend that you read the booklet that comes with this DVD. It documents the events leading up to the filming of Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture. Pennebaker almost never got to the show that night in 1973. That certainly would have been a shame. Thankfully, he DID make it there to film this historic event in Rock history. I am forever grateful.This movie was available on VHS for a number of years, but on VHS, it was a blurry, noisy mess. Many critics shunned it for its poor quality. And because of its bootleg-like quality, it was never released to theatres. ...Fast-forward to the digital age. Through much love and hard work, Ziggy Stardust: The motion picture has now arrived on DVD in stellar form. The Special Edition contains completely remastered audio (remastered by Tony Visconti) and video. Gone are the grainy picture and the poor sound. The improvement in quality is incredible. I can't believe what has been accomplished here. This DVD is a delight to watch. I can't recommend it more. It's a must for any rock fan. A Definate must for any Bowie fan. Buy it while you can still find it.I wasn't born when this historic concert took place. At 28 years of age, I missed out on the whole Ziggy era. It's a testament to Bowie's greatness that in those 28 years, I haven't seen anyone do it better. And without Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture, I wouldn't have got to see it at all. A+",

If David Bowie/Ziggy Stardust don't rub you the right way, you'll hate this movie, but if they're in your bag it should be a real treat.David/Ziggy is singing with the full force of his voice throughout, which you don't get to experience on the ZS album, making these versions of the songs some of my favourites. The filming style is absolutely perfect as well: stark-raving bright blocks of colour on pitch black, with a sort of rough, glittery feel. Gives it an air of fantasy and urgency that you wouldn't get with regular filming. Mick Ronson is a wonderful part of the film, completing the sound with his amazing guitar playing and complementing Ziggy visually. David/Zig is at his sexiest and most teasing here, and the costumes he uses have only been beat by the ones he wore in the 1980 Floor Show.It is gorgeous, glittering, sex-in-a-back-alley Rock and Roll!

The cinematography is, well...less grainy, but the camera is still bouncing quite a bit. You can't have everything! If you are a purist and just cannot stand an imperfect film, then take a pass.

Pennebaker who gave us a sometimes unflattering look at Bob Dylan in \"Don't Look Back,\" focused his camera on David Bowie during the then orange-haired musician's July 3, 1972 concert with The Spiders From Mars at London's Hammersmith Odeon.Much ballyhooed due to Bowie's surprise announcement at show's end that it would be the band's final concert, the film, though released briefly as a theatrical feature in 1983, first reached American audiences a decade earlier on ABC-TV's \"Wide World of Entertainment,\" a hodge-podge of programming (specials, TV movies, and the like) that replaced Dick Cavett as a late night alternative to Johnny Carson.Less polished than the Dylan film, this concert film is nonetheless more entertaining than most critic's reviews suggest. The performances, especially of material from \"Ziggy Stardust,\" are lackluster in comparison to the album but that's hardly surprising. But there are some fine moments unavailable elsewhere, including versions of Bowie's own \"All the Young Dudes,\" and Jacques Brel's melodramatic but affecting \"My Death.\"There are occasional backstage glimpses of Bowie, but this is a concert film, not a behind-the-scenes look at the star, so it doesn't fascinate in the same way Pennebaker's Dylan film does. But Bowie fans should find this of more than passing interest.Brian W. Fairbanks",

My only complaint is that the limitations of the 16MM film and the lenses they used severely hampered the quality of the images that were captured on stage. Quite often the lenses had issues processing the extreme colors and intensity of the lighting, so what you end up seeing is totally blown out and diffused or even out of focus. Too bad. It would be nice to see them take a better pass at restoration and release this on Bluray. Overall I would recommend for any serious Bowie fan as the music is just too good to pass up. The surround mix is fantastic, clear with a good amount of punch. Worth it just to hear the soundtrack (which I already owned on CD) in 5.1.",

But, it is what it is and just be glad that this concert exists because it shows Bowie at the height of his creativity. I know of no other concert of Ziggy &amp; The Spiders...I wish there was a crystal clear one out there. But, even with the flaws this is a timepiece that is priceless. A true artist at the top of his game. And Mick Ronson's guitar work is amazing. This is a piece or rock n' roll history that we're lucky to have at all!",

    "review/text": "Well, I just came back from watching the new release of the film (It's curretly playing at \"The Film Forum\", a small NYC theatre that appeals to film buffs). Its been supposedly re-mixed in Digital Dolby. I do have to say, it did sound different to me, and in fact much clearer than I remember, especially durring the first few songs (which people seem to complain about the most). Very enjoyable actually. Camerawork was still the same, but then I never minded it.Also of note, Moonage Daydream (my fav song from the film) sounded very different. No echos durring the choruses (\"Keep your electric eye on me Babe..babe..babe..babe....\"). Just not their at all. And the \"voices\" after the second chorus when Bowie and Mick do their little strut towards the back of the stage and then back to the front also were gone (or maybe much more subdued). Have to say I like the song better with those extras that I was used to before, but now it sounds much more like the version he does in the live \"Santa Monica 72\" album.Anyway, its a great show. This was pretty extravagant for concerts back then. I love it myself, but I can see why people would complain about its quality if they're used to MTV.This review is for the 2002 theatrical release of the movie.",

Still, for those of us who weren't there--and for those of us who were--it is a real treat!

    "review/text": "David Bowie is a myth. A myth in the cinema and in music. He systematically played on sexual roles and he tried to look like a woman and yet be a man. This concert in Hammersmith in London shows this choice rather well in the way he dresses, he has his face made-up and he behaves on stage. The backstage scenes are not really interesting and the sequences on the audience are plainly uninteresting. The latter concentrates on girls and women as if David Bowie was a model to them : their makeup, their dresses, their hair and head-dresses, etc. But their behavior is banal and even very standard for many concerts of this type, without any frenzy. There remains the music. It is rock and roll from an older period, the seventies and the eighties. It is very rhythmic, very melodious and even at times mesmerizing, but it does not have any of the power and even violence we have become used to since then. In one word it is very moderate, though definitely charming in the melodious and harmonic arrangements. Yet the remastering must have changed a few things because I seem to remember that music as being more aggressive and more feeling-raking. David Bowie acting on the stage is rather simple though effective : he shows his shaved legs in an enticing way but we do regret the lack or loss of the hermaphrodite and ambiguous signals and messages of old. David Bowie must have aged and he has followed the politically-correct evolution of the stage. In other words, in this gay-proud period of ours, he seems to wish not to show anything that could push him into that gay territory. He did not hesitate when it was by far nor recommended but now he seems to establish a distance between this new era and him, hence the emphasis on girls and women in the audience and on girls and women in the bachstage scenes. The myth has suffered with time because it has been edited and even rewritten. So, close your eyes and dream : when he sings of his love for an unnamed you we can reconstruct the vision of old and the impression we experienced then : he is talking to any you , female or male. But the visual show does not indeed. And the extras of the DVD are far ftrom being an enlarging approach of the character : we would have liked some more materials about his films and about his performance as a musician. But none of these here.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",

    "review/text": "D.A. Pennebaker's filming of the final concert by David Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust incarnation is a great piece of rock history. Ziggy Stardust &amp; The Spiders From Mars is considered to Mr. Bowie's masterpiece. Mr. Bowie not only created a classic album, but in adopting the androgynstic persona, he blurred the lines between male and female and spearheaded the glam rock movement. Unfortunately, this disk is a major disappointment from the visual side. The songs and performance are first rate, but the picture is horrible. The disk does not clean up the blemishes. It is grainy, blurry and just plain tough to look at. The camera work doesn't help matters either as Mr. Pennebaker keeps the camera locked on Mr. Bowie most of the time and many times in close-ups. This takes away from the full experience of the show. The producers did do a great job in remixing the sound and the 5.1 Surround Sound mode is clean and clear. You are better off buying the cd soundtrack version than the DVD. This is for diehard David Bowie fans only because of the atrocious picture quality not because of content.",

    "review/text": "The Mirage tour came at a time when the Mac members were pursuing solo careers, and finding it hard to get back into the classic Mac mood after the draining Tusk tour. Some solo careers were more successful than others however, naming no names..... The video features a large selection of Lindsey Buckingham songs, a fair amount of Christine McVie songs, and a pitiful three Stevie Nicks contributions. The music in some cases is very raw and wild, like a classic rock concert where the musicians are just playing what they want in any way they want, which is great, but Buckingham's 'Not That Funny' is about 10 minutes long, consisting of him dancing and playing fairly pathetic guitar, which makes the video a bit like .. 'OK, let's fast forward this bit, and this bit, and this bit', until you get to a 'proper song', like 'Blue Letter', 'You Make Loving Fun', and the moving and incredibly powerful performance of the Tusk album gem 'Sisters of the Moon.' It is interesting to see Fleetwood Mac perform at this point of self expression through solo careers, particularly Buckingham, who seemed to want to stay in his garage instead of playing with the Mac. Besides the slightly strained moments, this video is worth buying if you have some spare money about, as it captures a point of Mac history where creativity was at a peak, as well as some of the feelings between band members. The set list is unusual, which is very refreshing these days amidst just the old well known numbers which can get extremely tiresome. Buy this if you want to hear songs you didn't think had been performed, like 'Sisters of the Moon', 'Eyes of the world' and 'Blue Letter'.",

    "review/text": "This is a pretty good concert VHS. It show the transition of the Allman Bros. Band. What became of the sound after Duanne died. Butch Trucks didn't even dare use the slide techs that Duanne did and can't even come close to the great sound Warren Haynes added to the band later. Thus the ultimate sound of the Allman Bros. is missing something here. Although they keep their style, missing is the fast licks and slide guitar jams between Duanne and Betts. Trucks couldn't even come close if he wanted to. I don't think he wanted to. Here we have a fresh approach to the band. A bit slower and mellow sound. The best album from this era of the Allman Bros. is \"From The Madness Of The West\". A great album with some great tunes on it. \"Pegusus\" is a great tune that captures a great jam session. \"So Long\" is another awesome song from Greg Allman yet never got the airplay like the hits \"Jessica\" or \"Melissa\". However, this VHS concert doesn't feature any of the songs from that great album.Alltogether, if your a Allman Bros. fan, this is a decent one to rent and check out before buying. The best I can describe this era of the Allman Bros. Band is: The Allman Brothers minus Duanne or Warren's slide jams. Not much compitition between Betts and Trucks. Betts keeps the guitars alive in this one but without the partner slide jams, it's not the orginal Allman Bros. sound IMO. This version of the Allman Bros. couldn't do a version of \"In Memory of Eliz Reed\" even if they attepmted to try. Butch Trucks IMO wasn't the greatest guitar player. His son Derek is way better today than his Dad could ever dream of. Derek is the only piece IMO (besides Greg Allman & Warren Hayes) holding the old Betts sound together.",

It adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition (which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies) per se, it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment. McKellan and Redgrave do their best, but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d'etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer. That it won an Oscar for the screenplay says far more about the Academy's often appalling decisions than anything else. Perhaps, like the American Presidency, lobby money can buy anything.",

While this makes him uneasy, he returns over and over again. The film follows their strange relationship.One of the problems I have with this movie is the fact that it focuses entirely on Whale's sexual preference. Are viewers not supposed to care about anything else besides his homosexuality? Because I do.Also, the relationship between Boone and Whale is a perpetually bizarre one. Despite how uncomfortable he sometimes becomes when in Whale's presence, Boone cannot keep himself away. I found it quite unbelievable.Lastly, this movie is incredibly monotonous. Nothing really interesting occurs until the last thirty minutes.Near the end, James asks Clay, \"Do you believe people come into our lives for a purpose?\" Well, I believe that all films should have a purpose, whether that be to make people laugh, cry, or ponder.

Most famous for the two original films about the creation of life (seen as 'monsters'), Whale was found floating in his swimming pool. Officially called a suicide, the circumstances were questionable. Whale was gay in a time when Hollywood, at its most image-conscious and hypocritical, shunned any association with a lifestyle that suffused the industry. &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is a sensitive and substantial portrait of two men. Jim, played with elegance, poignancy, and humor by Ian McKellan, has had a stroke and is suffering the indignities of impaired functions and mental state. It is anathema for the formerly vigorous and humorous man to contemplate a future of declining health and increasing dependence. Jim befriends his hunky gardener, Clay Boone. Brendan Fraser is outstanding, as well as sweet and desireable, in the role. The roughly handsome young man models for Jim, preferably shirtless, and they talk. Lonely individualists with secret heartaches, the two men form an intimate, affectionate, and combative bond. Whale wistfully and painfully remembers, in haunting flashbacks, his youth, career, and tragic love for a young soldier in the ghastly trenches of WWI (learning first-hand the 'gallows' humor he brought to his films). These memories become increasingly mixed up with his relationship to Clay, who he begins to confuse with his 'monster'. The younger man, with honor and compassion, sticks by Whale till the end, and remembers his friend in a touching epilogue. This is a loving tribute to a man who contributed to, profited from, and was ultimately &quot;killed&quot; by a heartless studio system.",

Condon deftly blends together scenes from this relationship with Whale's memories of World War I, recreations of behind-the-scenes action on the set of &quot;Bride of Frankenstein,&quot; and other images from Whale's increasingly tormented mind.McKellen is superb in his challenging role: at times delightfully sly and witty, at times torn with lust or despair, Whale is an unforgettable figure. Fraser is also excellent. And Lynn Redgrave is similarly memorable in her role as Whale's devoted housekeeper (who nonetheless disapproves of his &quot;bugger&quot; lifestyle). The film's production values and additional performances are excellent; I was particularly impressed by the recreation of the set of &quot;Bride.&quot; And Carter Burwell's moody, elegant musical score really helps to unify and elevate the film as a whole.&quot;G&amp;M&quot; contains some delicious comic moments. But the film is, above all, a serious drama. Condon's intelligent script takes on such topics as the Hollywood &quot;closet,&quot; friendship that transcends differences, the trauma of war, and the place of the artist and his work in society. If you have been haunted by some of the images from the real-life Whale's films, you may find yourself similarly haunted, and enriched, by the superb &quot;Gods and Monsters.&quot;",

    "review/text": "I went into watching this film expecting to see nothing more than some Oscar caliber acting. It's not that I'm not a fan of the biopic, quite the opposite indeed, but I remember when this film was released and I remember having no desire to see it whatsoever. I broke down last week and said \"what the heck\" and watched it, beginning to end, and I have to say that I was utterly impressed by just about every aspect of this film. I wasn't privy to the life of famed Frankenstein director James Whale previous to watching this film, in fact the only part of his life I was aware of was his open homosexuality. What I wasn't aware of was his constant pains of loneliness and despair. The film so richly helps us to see that James only craved company, really nothing more than that.Ian McKellen probably gives his most superb performance here with his portrayal of the ailing Whale. His every movement is so intricate and well thought out that you forget your watching an actor. He was completely confidant and convincing in every way and well deserved that Oscar nod, and arguably the Oscar (I'm still on the Edward Norton bandwagon myself).The film explores the last days of Whale's life, as he becomes infatuated with his new gardener Clay Boone (Played by Brendan Fraser in a performance filled with talent I feel he lacks) while yet drifting further from his grip on reality. As Whale's condition worsens he is plagued by flashbacks that have horrible effects on his mental state causing him to hallucinate and making his relationships with others somewhat unstable. The tragic conclusion to the film involving the events leading up to Whale's suicide are completely engrossing and touching as they expose this man for who he really was, sad, alone and desperate.Lyn Redgrave does a wonderful job as Whale's long time housekeeper Hanna, giving the movie a sarcastic somewhat comedic edge, and Fraser, as I mentioned, played his part so wonderfully I was shocked I was watching that guy from the Mummy movies. He actually gave an Oscar caliber performance indeed. But, through and through, this is McKellen's movie and his finest hour indeed. Directed brilliantly by Bill Condon and masterfully adapted from Christopher Bram's novel `Father of Frankenstein', `Gods and Monsters' thrives with authenticity and affection in everything from the set pieces to the flash backs to the words left unspoken in the eyes of the actors. This is a truly moving picture that says so much about a man of whom I knew so little.",

    "review/text": "To be sure, there are a few clunky moments in \"Gods and Monsters,\" a pretty low budget piece of historical fiction about the final days of Hollywood's legendary director of horror, James Whale. The clunky moments usually have Brendan Fraser in them. He's the new \"yard man,\" Clayton Boone, at James Whale's estate, and he agrees to pose for Whale, played to a phosphorescent brilliance by Ian McKellen, because Whale tells Boone that his face has a remarkable architecture! Sure. It's McKellen at his horny old codger best.While Boone poses, Whale reminisces about everything from the trench Warfare of WWI where he was an officer to the days on the set of \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of Frakenstein.\" He includes tidbits about other Hollywood directors of the 1930's, particularly George Cukor and his wild Sunday pool parties to which only men where invited. Whale had been open about his homosexuality, and it's hinted that his openness may have been his undoing in hypocritical \"Tinsel Town.\" The yard boy only \"gets\" Whale's sexual orientation when the loyal housemaid of twenty years tells Boon, \"Mr. Whale is a bugger.\" Oh, says Boon, an ex-Marine: \"A homo!\" (Since the movie is set in 1957, the word \"Gay\" didn't exist.) I defy you to recognize Lynn Redgrave as the Hungarian housekeeper. She, like Ian, plays her part extraordinarily well. Two of Britian's greatest actors in the same film is reason enough to own this film.Since Whale has had a stroke, memories flood over him uncontrollably and he doesn't always take his medication that would tone these flashes down because it reduces the wit and brilliance that were his life-long trademark. Nonetheless, the superb screenplay and the savvy direction of Bill Condon, allow McKellen, a trained Shakesperian, to show why he is, without exception, the world's finest actor.In the greatest scene I may have ever watched in film, Whale and Boone go to a Cukor party where Princess Margaret is being feted. Cukor is standing by the princess in the receiving line, and Whale, impeccably dressed, introduces the obviously out-of-his-element yard boy to the princess. There is some tension between the two old directors, and Whale snaps that tension by declaring: \"Yes. Clayton hasn't met many princess, but he knows a great many Queens.\"In the film's climactic moment, Boone agrees to pose fully nude for Whale and what ensues is a brilliant moment that is erotic yet as sad-as-sad-could-ever-be.Whale, in my interpretation of the film, is the outcast just as his creation, Frankenstein, was an outcast looking for love and companionship. He doesn't find love, but Clayton Boone provided companionship.This is a truly great film.",

    "review/text": "This had to be one of the best movies of 1998 and one that holds up well after many viewings. Based on the novel by Christopher Braum, FATHER OF FRANKENSTEIN, and directed by Bill Condon (winner of an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay), GODS AND MONSTERS is the fictionalized account of the last days of James Whale-- \"Mr. Jimmy\" to his doting houskeeper played brilliantly by Lynn Redgrave-- who made the original FRANKENSTEIN and other Hollywood movies. Although the plot is rather thin at times, the acting is superb. Ian McKellen as the ailing but still dapper Whale has not lost his eye for attractive men and is still handsome in his silks, wools and tweeds. Brendan Fraser as the yard man gets so into his role that you can almost smell his sweat; but Lynn Redgrave as the housekeeper is simply wonderful. She is totally in character-- just watch her at any given moment-- and should have won an Oscar for this performance instead of another fine British actress Judi Dench who won that year for Best Supporting Actress. With another director and other, lesser actors, this film could have degenerated into another tasteless story of a sad, aging homosexual. But it did not. It is rife with both humor and pathos. Mr. Whale's meeting with Princess Margaret-- with his yardman in tow-- is hilarious, for example, while the flashbacks into his love for a World War I comrade are the stuff that tragedy is made of.This is a really very fine movie.",

There are many levels which will appeal to different people. People looking for a good story will find one superbly crafted. Those looking for industry jokes will find them as well, cleverly hidden behind the storyline. It's also a love story of sorts: of a director with his craft; of an aging man with a younger man; of a caretaker with her charge. Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser and Lynn Redgrave are expertly cast in this film. It doesn't hurt that it was co-produced by Clive Barker (a gay horror film director himself) The connection between the horror movie characters (the monster, the bride of the monster) and the characters in the film is expertly woven. This is a film within a series of films. Brendan Fraser is superb as the lonely young man who can't understand his attraction and revulsion for the aging director; Lynn Redgrave is flawless as the loving caretaker. Sir Ian MacKellen was indeed robbed of his Oscar for his performance in this film.Let this film open your heart.",

    "review/summary": "Beautiful, touching movie",
    "review/text": "This movie had such a small arthouse distribution when it was in the theater you'd never guess it is the gem that it is. And it is a gem.The movie combines many great cinematic elements: depth of characters; an engaging, credible storyline; set, setting, and scenery that match the film's overall beauty; and a poignant soundtrack that gracefully fills in the background and the transitions between scenes.Ian McKellan plays the character of James Whale exceptionally well. I'm not sure if this movie was meant for a wide audience, but if it was, it is nice to see the role of a gay man being played by a gay man. Not that James Whale is intensely gay, if you will, but as a gay man myself, I see strengths in his character that exhibit some of the best traits gay men have. Ian McKellan does his character justice by exhibiting the wit and wisdom of Whale that I don't think another actor could easily have pulled off. And that's the trick. It seems indeed easy for McKellan to exhibit the full range of his character's persona. He wins your confidence immediately.Good acting knows no sexual orientation. Playing the decidedly straight, brooding lawn man, and new object of Whale's admiration and friendship, Clay Boone, is Brendan Fraser. Fraser plays the role with an intimacy that matches McKellan's role as Whale. From the first interaction between the two (McKellan and Fraser) Fraser earnestly portrays with earnest the not so worldly Clay Boone, blue collar laborer, and the Clay Boone who's smarter than he appears and not your average buffoon. Fraser adeptly shows the full range of intellect and emotion of Clay Boone and in turn exhibits his talent as an actor. You're given a very precise image of Clay Boone as a near-drifter in life who's smarter than the average guy but lacks the cunning to put it all together into a life as equally as rich. It's a unique contrast for a character's personality and Fraser handles it well.The storyline surrounds the dynamics of the relationship between Whale and Boone, two people who couldn't seem to be any further apart but who are remarkably similar, as we learn. The two develop an understanding of each other and slowly learn to appreciate the other for who they are.Whale, being in declining mental health and advanced in years, is equally as intersted in Boone's companionship as he is in the sexual awe of Boone the innocently seductive straight man. Boone is not necessarily innocent, but certainly earns the compassion of the audience with his sincerity, and likewise pursues his friendship with Whale largely out of interst, though there is some financial connection with Boone as Whale's groundskeeper. Nevertheless, a memorable bond develops between the two and you see their emotions build as friends as different in person as these two are.The setting is the 50's (?) in Hollywood or at least LA, and primarily during the springtime, which in S. California has its own magical enchantment (coming from a NYer). Whale is an unabashedly gay former director who appears washed up to the cinema world by his irreverance (His Directorial ne plus ultra being \"Bride of Frankenstein\"), but who we see is still quite alive, if not angry and resentful with a streak of mild hatred. We learn that he's ultimately in great pain, physically, as the movie progresses, and mentally and emotionally, from the movie's begining to its end. The bulk of the film largely occurs at Whale's luxury home.I find the setting at Whale's beautiful, lushly vegetative Hollywood home a perfect match for this film. Every scene is filled with this sheer beauty from the decor of the house to the house grounds and even at the few places where Whale and Boone venture away. It's the type of beauty, that like both main characters, is hidden in plain sight, yet never quite attains its due recognition. It's almost overkill in its presence, but that also helps it to blend in the background. It's always there being understatement. But play this DVD on a nice flat-panel TV and see if your eyes don't light up at the lush enchanting color of Whale's residence, inside and out. As a backdrop for the drama of this film, the settings and scenery very accurately portray Whale's environment.The film is also accompanied by a mildly haunting score that, while not upbeat, is very hopeful, stately and not at all depressing in its portrayal of melancholy. It matches well the tone of Whale's advanced years and to a degree Boone's identity. Both characters are somewhat lost in life, Whale an aging director bereft of respect from his peers, and Boone a young former marine trying to find himself and make sense of the world around him. The music conveys this imagery well.I think this movie is excellent and I highly recommend it. It is not really a gay movie, though it does give an honest portrayal of one gay man's life. There is very brief frontal male nudity along with nudity from behind but it's not sexual and incidental to the film's success. More accurately, the film acknowledges the value and contribution of Whale as an aging former director and brilliant, contributing, functioning member of society, who is very much gay.",

    "review/text": "If you've enjoyed the old classic Universal Studio films of Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein, you will especially enjoy this feature, since it is basically a story about the last days of the creative genius and the director of those films, James Whale.The story of Gods and Monsters generally revolves around an emotionally traumatized and physically ailing movie director (majestically played by Ian McKellan), his attraction to his new gardener (played by Brendan Fraser), and the resulting emotionally intense and tumultous relationship that follows. In this movie, Brendan Fraser gives one of his better acting perfomances. Ironically, Fraser's overall physique and head shape are some very striking physical features which happen to resemble Whale's Frankenstein monster. Lynn Redgrave (who you can barely recognize in her part) is cast as James Whale's annoyingly moralizing yet concerned caretaker (and she's just as annoying as the caretaker in the original Bride of Frankenstein)Initially, this movie is slow moving but it is no doubt, a thought and affect provoking film that provides some interesting and intriguing insights into man's fears, and the nature of intimacy, loneliness, love and human nature in general. By portraying Whale's experiences, Gods and Monsters also provides some excellent insights into Whale's movie themes and brings you behind the curtain into the Hollywood movie culture.The bright and vivid colors of the cinematography of this film are an ironic contrast to Whale's old B&W; horror movies and to his themes which generally involved the 'darker' or more 'taboo' sides of human nature and emotion.This is a cerebral drama. Gods and Monsters is a movie about genuine relationships rich in emotion and affect. It's likely to trigger your own strong emotional response. Beware!",

    "review/text": "This film achieves to the fullest extent what it set out to do; To present a portrait of a man during the final stages of his life, and all which that implies. The man in question is no other than legendary Hollywood director, James Whale, who his most famous for doing FRANKENSTEIN. But the film is never really just about James Whale. We don't meet Whale the director, we meet Whale the person, and as I was watching the film I continously thought to myself that this could be any person; We're watching a man who knows that his time here on earth is nearly up, and not a film that just tries to give a biographical account of James Whale's life. The man in question just happens to be James Whale.A problem with biographical films is that they're often too much in awe of the person they depict. GODS AND MONSTERS never attempts to glorify James Whale. We see him through his pros and cons; Clearly he was a genious at what he did and that can't be denied, but he was also at times very selfish and brute, and Bill Condon (the director of the film) doesn't censor these aspects of Whale's character. Again this brings out the person in James Whale and not the director.Sir Ian McKellen is brilliant! He stars as the now retired James Whale, who is living out his final years at his estate, far from the buzzing life of Hollywood. In his house he resides with a small crew of servants, most notably an old housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave gives a great performance) and a newly hired young and handsome gardener, Clayton Boon (Brendan Frasier). James Whale was one of the few celebrities at that time that was openly homosexual, and the film focuses on the relationship between Whale and Boone.Bill Condon has also taken extensive use of the flashback-technique, to show how the past has a way of catching up with an old man.GODS AND MONSTERS is such a tremendous achievement that any attempt at describing it with words seems to fall short. I *loved* this film. It's one of those few films where you stop thinking of photography and directing and music and lighting and editing, and all that, and instead just immerse yourself in the film. It's a fantastic feeling when that happens! When film becomes escapism. I'll end my review by saying this; GODS AND MONSTERS is a must see!",

Ian McKellen is superb as the eldering gay director who gets a real friend in his last day (&quot;I'm not interested in your body, I can assure you.&quot;). I watched Benigni and it's really a failure that McKellen's performance wasn't honored by the Academy. And so is Lynn Redgrave's (&quot;Mr. Jimmy! [...] he's a bugger!&quot;). Look at the underrated Bredan Fraser who proves he can act. But eventually the film has a brillant script, transferred to film and adapted by Bill Condon. Technically, you will get one of the best DVDs made yet (look at the color, at the contrast). Only thing missing is Dolby Digital 5.1. Go and buy it! Now!",

    "review/text": "This is definitely a movie about a subject quite taboo in its respective 1950's timeframe, homosexuality. It explores this subject with long secluded and retired &quot;Frankenstein&quot; director, James Whale. In the process, he also tries to come to terms with his life.I thoroughly enjoyed the acting in this film, especially that of Lynn Redgrave who portrayed James Whale's doting and cynical housekeeper, Hannah. Everytime she appeared on the screen, I had to laugh, even before she uttered a word. This portrayal is one of the finest low keyed comic performances I've ever seen.I was equally impressed with Ian McKellan's performance as well. As he decays and his perception of reality withers away, you feel an awesome pity for this man. This makes the ending almost a relief.Brendan Fraser is your basic Californian young &quot;dude&quot;. His performance is very typical of that, but I suppose he fit the part well. You can see the immaturity of his acting in relation to that of his veteran costars. His prime role I think was to be a beautiful inspiration to the man obsessed with him, James Whale. Its far from a romance, but this makes you pity the old director even more.",

    "review/text": "The 1998 film \"Gods and Monsters\" is a thought-provoking film that speculates on the final days of an early Hollywood film director named James Whale (1889-1957), who had directed two classic Hollywood monster films: \"Frankenstein\" (1931) and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" (1935). Portrayed by the brilliant actor Ian McKellan (best known for his portrayal of the character Gandalf in the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy between 2001 and 2003, as well as the character Magneto in the \"X-Men\" films of 2000 and 2003), James Whale lived a relatively solitary life in his later years, except for the companionship of his housekeeper Hanna (Lynn Redgrave). James Whale was also gay and found his new gardener, Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser), quite attractive. After talking with Clayton, James was able to convince Clayton to model for him, as James was also an artist. However, James was always reluctant to show Clayton what he had drawn. Not being gay himself, Clayton didn't always feel comfortable around James; but the relationship that developed between them was one of mutual. Clayton was interested in James' stories about his early Hollywood years, as well as his military career during World War I, and James even invited Clayton to go with him to a posh Hollywood party. Unfortunately, James was not as healthy as he wanted to be (having survived a stroke). This became an increasingly pressing issue for him as time passed, but he had not shared this issue with Clayton until an intensely emotional night.To its credit, \"Gods and Monsters\" won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. Ian McKellan received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Lynn Redgrave received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. With a fascinating cast of characters, wonderful acting and an engaging plot, I rate \"Gods and Monsters\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars. Other memorable characters include Edmund Kay (Jack Plotnick), Boris Karloff (Jack Betts), Princess Margaret (Cornelia Hayes O'Herlihy), and the young James Whale (Brandon Kleyla).",

    "review/text": "Without a doubt, those who appreciate fine, character-driven films will find much to like in Bill Condon's 1988 critically acclaimed biopic on legendary horror director James Whale. Ian McKellen delivers his finest performance to date as the charming, charismatic director whose best days are behind him along with Lynn Redgrave as the doting maid and Brendan Fraser as a young gardener who strikes up a quick and quirky friendship with Whale. The beauty of this film lies in its narrow scope with its very small palette of locations and supporting characters, giving the film a very intimate feel in the close confines of the three major players along with the subtlety of their interaction.On the disc itself all you'll get is a poorly transferred trailer and a ho-hum 30 minute featurette that offers little in the way of further value. Also disappointing is the lack of a proper Dolby 5.1 audio track - all you'll get on this shiny disc is a paltry 2.0 mono job.",

    "review/text": "Gods and Monsters is a work of fiction based on fact. James Whale was a great director at Universal that created the horror genre and most remembered for his films Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and Show Boat with Irene Dunne. And he was openly gay.Ian McKellan plays Whale and Lynn Redgrave his devoted servant Hannah. In the film, they have added a character of Boone (Brenden Frasier). Boone is a gardener and cuts the lawn at Whale's estate. Boone also represents an alter ego of the Frankenstein monster (including a hair cut that resembles a flat top.)The film takes place during the final years of Whale's life. He has had a couple of minor strokes that disrupts his thought filters. Therefore, little things make is mind wander to other times. The film floats from the present to Whale's childhood to the filming of Bride of Frankenstein.Whale becomes infatuated with Boone, not sexually but as the personification of the his creature. He starts by drawing them, then he befriends him. Boone cannot understand this platonic relationship but accepts it. The film ends with Whale's drowning death.Ian McKellan and Lynn Redgrave give master classes in acting and both received Oscar nomination - both should have won. Brendan Frasier continues his dichotomy of performances, wonderful nuanced performance like this followed by mind numbing drivel (which, I guess, pays the bills.)DVD EXTRAS:Director CommentaryThe World of Gods and Monsters - A very well made 30 minute making of documentary featuring cast, director and guest commentary by director Clive Barker.",

    "review/text": "This is an excellent film that vividly portrays the plight of many elder men in the gay community. The director-of-yesteryear character was played with Oscar-caliber acting (Ian was nominated). He plays the tormented director who remembers the lavish parties and the numerous young pretty boys who sought his attention, primarily due to his prestige in the film-making industry. As he lost this prestige, so did he misplace the affections of these pretty boys, until Fraser (the landscaper) is viewed at a distance and is seduced. Out of pity or respect, Fraser gives the ultimate gift of himself, but the sadness and hunger of the director takes advantage of the offer. An excellent portrait of a bridge between hetero- and homo-sexual urges. Fraser should have been nominated as well in this film. It is a drama to be viewed hopefully by those outside of the gay community as well as the younger members of the community caught up in the club-scene. It provides a reminder, to be kind to your elders and looks and prestige last only so long. What goes around, truly comes back.",

    "review/text": "Ian McKellen, together maybe with Patrick Stewart and Christopher Plummer are today's equivalents to yesteryear's Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud and Richard Burton.Especially here, in \"Gods and Monsters\", a tale based on the last few years in James Whale's life (legendary director of both \"Frankenstein\", 1931 and \"The Bride of Frankenstein\", 1935), in the mid fifties.This is a very stylish told story. It has everything. Elegance, tragedy and comedy, all tied closely together to form an admirable tapestry of a man's story at the end of his career and life.Brendan Fraser delivers a low-key performance, worth watching, especially when compared to his work in the Mummy series.Lynn Redgrave, is as always, mistress of her skills and gives a superb performance with an appropriate Danish accent, as the Governess of this odd household.Even the theme regarding Whale's latent/rampant homosexuality is kept at a discreet and elegant distance. Never too blatant, nor vulgar, but rather stylishly knit into a very coherent story.It's a kind of a Mephisto's waltz performed by an aging Faustus-like figure, in search for a self-redeeming auto-destruction, which eventually will see itself fulfilled, but not the way the hero of our story expects.In the key words to this movie there are definitions to gay DVD, gay movie or gay romance. It is far from that.This movie has absolutely nothing of a gay movie, nor has it anything to do with being directed at gay people.This work has far more style than this alone. It deals with an old man's conflict, who may be a bit of a dandy, when it comes to \"boys\", but who also genuinely expresses feelings of true tenderness and love, sentiments that today may be unknown to some, even in the so-called heterosexual community, but who are very real and alive in every true human being, be he a woman, a man, or as in this case, a homosexual.What is explored in this picture, is far more the \"soul\" of the matter, and not just the plain physical aspects of it, although elements of this also briefly appear, but always with a sense of style and never just to shock the audience.It is a movie for mature, and thinking audiences, not for those seeking a self-gratifying moment or a sexually oriented one.The DVD has a very good film transfer, sharp and clean, as well as a very well balanced sound included.It is well worth the money, if one is interested in good actor's performances and in a well told story.I can only recommend it.

    "review/text": "Gods and Monsters' is filmmaking at its best, depicting the final days of James Whale, a complex and complicated man, famous for directing the first two `Frankenstein' films, 'The Invisible Man', and the original movie version of `Showboat.' Exquisite performances are given by the great Sir Ian McKellen as Whale, who executes every nuance, every witticism, every emotion, with a perfection that is little short of incredible; Lynn Redgrave as Hanna, Whale's formidable but devoted housekeeper; and Brendan Fraser, in a wonderfully humane acting turn as Clayton Boone, Whale's hunky groundskeeper, who is unwittingly and inexorably drawn into Whale's ever-increasingly confused and confusing world. Whale's initial interest in Clay is sexually motivated, but the relationship becomes much more labyrinthine for both men than is originally bargained for. But the real `stars' of this movie are the direction (Bill Condon, who also wrote the screenplay) and the cinematography, producing visuals that are often haunting and infinitely memorable, especially during the flashback sequences and in the metaphorical &quot;monster&quot; scenes. One of my favorites is a scene in which Fraser gazes at his own reflection in a sink filled with water--it's a breathtakingly fragile image, shivery and shimmering and achingly delicate, and it seems to suggest at something much deeper and far-reaching within Clay himself. This is a film filled with such images and subtext--dreamlike, poetic touches, superimposed within the structure of an otherwise `conventional' story. Superb.",

    "review/text": "As a society enamored of Hollywood we tend to focus most of our interest on the people who star in the movies. What these actors and actresses are up to keeps us constantly scanning the news shows, legitimate periodicals, and tabloids. Frequently, this fascination causes us to forget that someone was directing these movies. Only a small handful of Directors ever get the attention that we focus on the stars. This movie focuses on one.James Whale directed many movies but the two that put him on the map were Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. This movie focuses on the last weeks of his life. Prior to the beginning of the movie he has had a stroke. While Whale has made a complete recovery physically the stroke has affected his brain. He is beginning to have flashbacks of his younger years and loves. Memories that he may be happier not remembering. We discover that Whale may have been hounded out of the elite of Hollywood over a sex scandal. You see, while it is acknowledged that there are homosexuals in Hollywood, it has always been something that people don't want to have flaunted in front of them. Whale didn't care what people thought and seemed to have many wild parties at his house.Whale begins a strange relationship with a young gardener that has recently begun to work for him. The gardener, Clayton Boone, is a strapping young man who is searching for something in his life. The two's relationship grows as each begins to find more of what they are missing from the other until the final explosive night.Ian McKellen is James Whale. Mainstream American audiences haven't seen much of McKellen over his long career. That will soon pass as McKellen has been signed as Magneto in the upcoming X-Men film. All who have seen him find McKellen to be a phenomenal actor and richly deserving of all the awards that have come his way. The surprise to some in this movie will be the man who plays Clayton Boone, Brendan Fraser. Mainstream audiences are used to Fraser in movies such as Encino Man and George of the Jungle. While exceedingly funny movies, they don't show his acting ability to the fullest. This role does. Fraser is with McKellen step for step all the way through expressing surprise that this famous man wants to spend time with him and then coming to a greater understanding of himself.This is a very powerful movie. Some will not like it because of the blatant homosexual references throughout but to allay this fear it is for the most part not graphic in this depiction. The movie is well directed and the acting by all is wonderful!",

He's a human being.I love when the two characters are talking about Frankenstein and the Director asks, \"Did anybody laugh?\".... People can be so dense. It's just like those people writing negative reviews. They are so close-minded, they could never accept concepts like that... that a horror film was meant to make you laugh..And I don't think every one gets the inside joke. The way you make yourself a GOD is to make someone else a MONSTER.All the monster wants is a friend.And the religious connotations that go along with this concept!I LOVE this movie.",

    "review/text": "I watched this movie yesterday, on a lovely Saturday afternoon. Maybe i should have went to the beach, because all this movie did was make me restless. Yes indeed it was a quality movie, with great acting by Ian Mckellen and Lynn Redgrave. The thing that ruined it for me was Brenden Fraser. I believe he was miscast. It seems as though they gave him the part because he looks so much like Frankenstein. He should have played Frankenstein and someone like Pauly Shore could have played &quot;Boon&quot;. (just kidding of course!)The overall look of the film was beautiful. It had alot of style. Another problem I had with Gods and Monsters though, were the doldrum periods of the plot where Whale and Boon would sit around and psycho-babble with each other and try and pick each others brains apart. They did this too many times in the film and the reluctancy of Boon was a real turn off. Brenden Fraser does play a GREAT homophobe! I also found it repulsive that Whale allowed Boon back into his life even after Boon degrated him and did nothing short of spitting in his face. Whale should have just kicked him to the curb!The part I don't understand is why Whale had such a fascination with Boon. Why did he do so much for this guy? Boon came off as such a jerk, a no brains kind of guy, an opportunist. Was Boon just a piece of you know what to Whale? If so, that is really sad that he chose to cherish and embrace someone like Boon. That's what I didn't like about this film! The weak characters!",

    "review/text": "A promising movie, that never finally delivers. The acting is very good, most of the time. The use of a few moviestar look-alikes was fun. Brendan Fraser was ok. He could have had more depth and more presence. Ian McKellen was terrific. His devilish, weak-lipped, wry smile carried the film, as it does in his other films. The Frankenstein myth was interpolated into a grander metaphor to some extent, but not to complete satisfaction. I pretty much \"got it\" by the middle of the movie and was expecting the movie to traverse some higher plateau on the back of the conflict and metaphor, but it never really got there and the second half didn't add a whole lot of sparkle. I was disappointed. It didn't live up to being what I had been expecting from all the glowing reviews. Like the monster, it had all the parts, but there wasn't any transforming thunderclaps, no touch of the gods. The ending was rather simple, not at all profound, and the last scene was a bit contrived, even silly, in an amateur film-school kind of way. I suspect others are taken with this film more by the nostalgia it conjures than by the dramatic resolution of its storyline. It's just not the great film of its reputation. It's worth watching, but there are many films worth watching, and many others I'd much more recommend for your time. This one, you could easily go without, unless maybe, you're a real Frankenstein or gay buff, but even then, it's not sufficiently strong on either of those themes. It had great potential. It was \"close, but no cigar\"--or maybe, that should have been Mr. Whale's line.My review update: Ok, I watched it a second time--this time without the high expectation--and I'll give it more credit after the second viewing. It ranks among the very good films. I'll take back the \"you could easily go without\" part. It is a very tight film and worth your time for the quality of production and it does have a strong message. But still, \"friend?\" is not a huge message, and I still found its ending weak. Basically, it's a small very good film, still not the five star great of its reputation. I suspect some people overreact to this film out of some form of political correctness. I'd kick it up to a four star--good tight script, mostly good acting, good direction--but it doesn't aspire to the high summit of a five star film.",

    "review/text": "OK, there's a lot I didn't like about this movie. Number 1, the subject, James Whale of Frankenstein fame, is not portrayed very sympathetically. In fact, I found the character (played by McKlellan) quite displeasing, with his raunchy and egotistical appetites. There is a term, \"growing old gracefully.\" Mr. Whale in this portrayal does not seem to have become wiser with age and experience, but to have become a sad, pathetic old coot.Secondly, the film goes nowhere in the first 45 minutes. The narrative merely circles around the central facts of Whale's celebrity, his main films, a possible scandal, all of which are planted in the dialog just so the audience can be informed, for instance, that James Whale made Frankenstein, that he helped create the horror genre, that he is gay, etc. It just seemed jarring to hear these facts trotted out for narrative purposes, when they could have been revealed in a more timely and less obvious manner in the course of the film. But as the director wanted to set up the drama early, we are given a crash course on James Whale via the conversations of bar patrons, the gardener and the maid. Puleeeze!Thirdly, I thought the screenplay forced it's points too much. To take one instance, Fraser's gardener character is first shown coming out of a broken down trailer and stepping into a broken down pickup truck. OK, he's white trash; got it. In another scene, following one in which he is offended by James Whales' fliratious manner, he has sex with a girl he picks up in a bar. Okayyy...feeling a bit unmasculine, are we? I mean, almost every point of the movie is telegraphed, so the audience is smashed over the head with each point the director wishes to bring home.I guess, I just wish the movie's producers had been more subtle and cunning in how they portrayed people and their emotions. I wish they had taken the audience's intelligence for granted. Who did they think would go see Gods and Monsters anyway? Joe Sixpack? If you're going to make a small independent film, one thing you can take for granted is that those going to see it are going because they have an interest in the film and in the subject matter of the film. You can dispense with the *setup* and just get into the meat of what you want to say with the film.",

    "review/text": "A sexually upfront, retired film director who happened to be gay (Ian McKellen). His tut-tutting Germanic housekeeper (Lynn Redgrave). Their hostile, hunky ex-Marine lawnboy (Brendan Fraser). The characters are the stuff of stereotype but in this fine movie, based loosely on the last days of 1930s movie director James Whale (*Frankenstein*, *Bride of Frankenstein*, *Showboat*), excellent writing and performances combine to make GODS AND MONSTERS a worthwhile if occasionally provocative film about the classic themes of love and death.It's 1957 and the aging Whale, comfortably retired in L.A., take a shine to the new lawnboy Clayton Boone (a fictional creation) and asks him to pose for a painting. The young man is reluctant at first but goes along for the easy work and ready money. Clay is -- let's say -- pretty touchy about his virtue until Whale makes it clear the boy is in no danger from him. A curious platonic friendship emerges and grows based on mutual trust and respect (one small example: Whale, escorted by Clay, attends a snotty lawn party and derives immense satisfaction from twitting the still-closeted George Cukor).This film is almost entirely a character study and the events that close the movie most likely happened in real life: Whale was found dead in his swimming pool, most likely a suicide brought on by diminished capacity. The real action in this picture are the multiple indignities young Whale suffered as a hobbled preacher's kid and a novice Army officer in the horrible trenches of World War One, like mini-autobiographical snippents that Whale \"imagines\" cinematically and relates to Clay. Some welcome comic relief follows in a dream Clay has, a campy recreation of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, with Clay himself cast as the blockheaded monster on a flawlessly re-created Universal Pictures studio set. Those sequences are in bluish black-and-white but most of the film has a deliberately burnished, Fifties widescreen Technicolor look that is just grand to watch. The powerful performances are key here, as well: rather than merely triangulate his three powerful stars, director and co-writer Bill Condon pairs off Fraser, McKellen and Redgrave and lets their characters grow in nuance, not react strictly to form.I do not know why GODS AND MONSTERS was a relative disappointment at the box office when it played in 1998; perhaps McKellen's forthright portrayal of a gay man was too strong for the mass audience back then. Perhaps Brendan Fraser had, during that period, been stereotyped as a George-of-the-Jungle goofus and turned off the potential art-house crowd. (In fact, his performance in this pic is marvelous and every bit the equal of the two veterans he played off.) Although they occupy little screen play, the supporting task is fine too and includes Lolita Davidovich as Clay Boone's soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend and some dead ringers at the lawn party for Boris Karloff, Elsa Lancaster and Elizabeth Taylor. Production standards do not disappoint, both interior and exterior shots are sumptuous and full of meaning; in fact, one of the high points of director Condon's very good Commentary on the disc is learning how much was put up there on screen at relatively low cost and in very little time.I feel GODS AND MONSTERS has been unjustly ignored and feel it deserves a wider audience. For what it's worth it's not a \"gay movie\" any more than it is an ex-Marine movie but tells its own story with an almost chamber-like precision and a pinpoint visual palette. Not a kiddie movie but a literate film that combines wit, brave characterizations and lots of good old entertainment value. Highly recommended..",

    "review/text": "GODS AND MONSTERS(1998)---Sir Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave, Lolita Davidovich, David Dukes, Kevin J. O'Conner.This film is based on Christopher Bram's fictionalized novel about James Whale, the English director who made FRANKENSTEIN; BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN; THE OLD DARK HOUSE; and THE INVISIBLE MAN, among other films. Although not a true biography of Whale, the film is historically accurate in many respects. We learn that Whale was born to poor, lower-class parents(a fact which deeply affected him as an adult), that he served in WWI(the horror of which was something else that left an indelible mark on him), that he began his career in the theater and had an enormous stage success with the play, \"Journey's End\", which resulted in his being summoned to Hollywood to direct films, and that he was openly homosexual at a time in Hollywood when doing so could be disastrous for one's career---his long-time \"companion\" was David Lewis, who had a successful career as a producer---first at MGM, then at Warner Bros.---among the films he produced/co-produced were: RIFFRAFF; CAMILLE; ALL THIS AND HEAVEN TOO; KING'S ROW; IN THIS OUR LIFE; and RAINTREE COUNTY.Sir Ian McKellen was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Whale and he is wonderful to watch in this film. Fraser plays a young ex-Marine who works as Whale's gardener and Redgrave plays Whale's devoted, but devoutly Catholic, housekeeper who fears for his salvation due to his homosexuality. Among Whale's avocations is painting and he asks Fraser if he would agree to let him paint his portrait in return for being paid to do so. Aware of his sexual orientation, Fraser agrees but makes it clear that he won't do any of that \"nude stuff\". Whale suffers a stroke(historically true) which leaves him physically unaffected but affects his mind so that he begins to have flashbacks to events from his past, primarily from WWI. Over time, McKellen and Fraser develop a friendship and we learn much that is historically true about the making of some of Whale's classic horror films and the sexual proclivities of some other famous Hollywood figures(most prominently, director George Cukor, who was a \"closet homosexual\").As Whale's flashbacks become more frequent, his doctors confirm that he will eventually sink into a \"mental twilight\", unable to live in the \"present\". In the climactic scene of the film, Whale pours out his terror of losing his mind and not being able to do anything creative---even paint. In an attempt to comfort his friend, Fraser agrees to let Whale paint him in the nude, but stresses that there is to be no \"hanky-panky\". Whale begins to suffer one of his flashbacks and begins to think that Fraser is the young lover he met while serving in the trenches. He begins to try and make love to Fraser, who becomes angry and throws Whale to the floor, bringing him back to reality. Whale is horribly embarrassed, begs his forgiveness, and assures him that nothing like that will ever happen again. The next morning, Fraser discovers Whale's lifeless body floating in the swimming pool---a suicide who can't live with the thought of losing his mind. Whale's body was found in his pool in 1957 and was ruled a suicide.I think this is a wonderful film---by turns funny, informative, and deeply moving. In addition to McKellen's superb performance, both Fraser and Redgrave are completely convincing in their roles and the cinematography is beautiful. Highly recommended",

    "review/text": "I have read the majority of customers reviews of this movie good and bad, and I would like to start by saying, take out the homosexual component of the movie. Every review centers on that aspect. If this had been between a man and a woman and the theme was identical, would it make it any better or worse. This is a human story, about lonliness and last days of life, not a happy topic I admit. If you remove the local and drop Ian and Brendan in any other setting and have them perform, it would still be an amazing movie. James Whale is handled with empathy by Sir Ian. Mr. Frazier shows he can act...in fact this is the only movie in which he shows this and it is truly a shame. Who knew he ever had talent other than acting like an idiot. Hollywood has missed the boat with Mr. Frazier's ability. The chemistry between the two men comes out of the screen. Yes, this movie is a bit slow, but this is not an action film, it is not meant to be. Not to be overlooked is Lynn Redgrave. She does play the character a bit over the top, but it creates a great balance to the bleakness in both male charcters lives. The final scene between Whale and Clay is nothing short of \"heart stopping\", not because Frazier is naked, but because of the way it unfolds. The emotionals are raw and real...and you feel it.This is one of my favorite films, superbly written, directed and acted. It is what film making should be, it should move you not always entertain you. So forget the gay aspect and view this as two people with lonely lives, shattered dreams and a need to end it all.",

    "review/text": "It hardly seems like 11 years since Gods and Monsters was released. I had the opportunity to view it again just recently and I am happy to say that this film remains as rich and full as I had recalled it being. The performance by Sir Ian McKellan reminds us just how masterful he is as an actor, and Brendan Frasier gives a nuanced performance that is subtle and reflective and reminds one that much of the art of acting is listening and reacting. Lynne Redgrave spectacularly burst back onto the scene, giving a performance as Whale's maid/friend/caretaker that is richly complex: She is a friend and employee, both loving and judgmental of Whale for his homosexual \"lifestyle.\"The story is a simple one of friendship and understanding. It is about the ghosts which haunt us all. The Gods that have created us and the Monsters which have torn us down, and how sometimes the Monsters are what we need the most. Director Condon expertly intersperses clips from Whale's The Bride of Frankenstein with flashbacks to WWI, Whale's bygone days of fame, and young Jimmy Whale's childhood in order to give us an overview of the remarkable life this man has led. The result is that while Whale may seem like a broken down old man at the point the movie takes place, these flash backs paint a full picture of the man. Likewise, this lets us understand how Whale feels that all that he was is slipping away, just like his art is falling by the wayside. In the end, we see an immensely dignified, human being, who did wonderful things. He loved. He lost. He fought in the war. He was a hedonist. He was a pacifist. And he was loved.With Clayton Boone, the director and Brendan Frasier, give us a modern day physicality of the Frankenstein monster which first draws Whale to the young man. In the beginning, we're not quite sure what Whale wants from the lad -- does he desire a true friendship or is he just a lecherous old man-but as things progress we realize that while the friendship is important, his desire for the young Boone are a bit darker that even we could have thought. Likewise we're not sure what Clayton wants from Whale. But as we watch them become friends, we see a unique bond form...gay man to straight man...and each has found in the other someone to listen to them and understand.Perhaps unsung in this movie is the brilliant performance by Redgrave. Her housekeeper Hanna is not only an homage to Una O'Conner's \"Minnie\" in The Bride of Frankenstein, but an expert characterization that is humorous and judgmental and, ultimately, loving. The characterization is as broad as Whale might have directed O'Conner, but the humanity underneath it all is very, very real.Gods and Monsters is clearly fiction. No one really knows about the last days of Whale. But in that speculation, the film manages to paint a portrait of a man who was ahead of his time and who lived a life worth living. In the end, Director Condon and novelist Christopher Bram -- whose book The Father of Frankenstein serves as the underlying source of the movie -- gave Whale a friend in his last days, a young man named Clayton who was as different from Whale as he could be. They gave him a friendship, and as a result they have created a sad, touching, joyful movie about living and dying with dignity.As the Monster himself would say: Alone, bad...Friend, good.Originally reviewed for Uniquely Pleasurable.",

    "review/text": "At one point in &quot;Gods and Monsters,&quot; Ian McKellan's character, James Whale, gestures to his head and remarks, &quot;The real monsters are up here.&quot; The film spends its entire creating a way of life around this observation, portraying the last days of the well-known film director in ways that evoke humor, touching emotion, and above all else, emotionally haunting reflection on one's life.It's a most unusual film, not completely a biopic, yet not entirely fictional; it's more of a speculation on his latter days, based on the novel &quot;Father of Frankenstein,&quot; written by Christopher Bram. The reality of Whale's life, from his superior and delectable wit to the memories of war and Hollywood that delight and haunt him, is the basis of the novel and the film, as Whale relates them to a young gardener in whom he takes an emotional and physical interest.The story begins by introducing us to Whale's way of life, from his slowly deteriorating health and mental state, to his luxurious home, where he lives with his maid, Hanna (Lynn Redgrave), who is caring yet keeps up a stern demeanor when it comes to his dealings in homosexuality. The presence of the new gardener, Clay Boone (Brendan Fraser), strikes a chord within Whale, who resumes his sketching by asking the young ex-Marine to pose for his drawing, offering a face-only clause as a way of quelling Clay's obvious insecurities.The film's own openness with the issues of sexuality effectively portrays the flamboyance of its main character, who apparently saw no shame in his ways despite the resentment of homosexuality in the 1950's. The movie embodies this ignorance in Clay, who, at first, is unaware of his newfound friend's orientation. Once he discovers the truth from Hanna, his discomfort becomes even more unstable, to the point where he storms out in a rage of fury over the old man's excessive way with discomforting words. And yet, he returns to act as Whale's model, intrigued by the heartwarming and heartbreaking stories he offers as he sketches.This is a most fragile and unsteady friendship, yet in spite of the discomfort that surrounds their bond, their is a certain degree of comfort to be found within it. This stems from director Bill Condon's avoidance of character glorification: in &quot;Gods and Monsters,&quot; everyone has flaws. We see Whale's mood swings, his obsession with young boys in his old age, and his reluctance to recall his past; Clay also spends his time running, from his family, commitment, and stability. Ultimately, this makes their friendship mutually beneficial, allowing Clay a broader, richer view of life while allotting Whale the chance to face memories he would otherwise hide away forever.All of this is painted in broad strokes by Condon, who employs humor, wit, and sadness into his stunning adaptation. The discomfort that arises as a result of Clay's discovery of his friend's sexuality is handled lightly in earlier scenes, slowly gaining resonance and meaning as the plot moves along its dreamlike path. Whale's memories of filming the &quot;Frankenstein&quot; movies are realistic in their approach, while his recollections of war and his lost love are emotionally charged. All of this is given a slow yet mesmerizing pace that allows us into the deepest subconscious of the characters, so that we not only see what is going on in their minds, but can feel it as well.In the film's favor is its credible casting choices, most notably McKellan, who employs wit and real emotional range as Whale. Making sudden and drastic jumps from jubilant to unstable, McKellan's Whale is portrayed as someone whom we feel for, a man whose life is put into perspective in a manner that calls us to look at it with unblinking eyes. Fraser evokes a subtle sexual tension and eroticism as Clay, whose resemblance of Frankenstein's monster is the focal point of Whale's fascination. Redgrave makes a wonderful turn as Hanna, putting her wit and sarcasm to good use as the woman who embodies a maid, a wife, and a mother all at the same time.Above all else, the most perplexing aspect of &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is its connection to Whale's film, &quot;Frankenstein.&quot; Clay's resemblance and sense of naivety when in the presence of Whale is very much like the scene from that earlier film that this film's final scene. Seeing that final scene is to finally realize and acknowledge the film's purpose; it's one of those forceful moments in cinema that only come once in a blue moon. The film itself is a most touching achievement, deriving its success from its examination of Whale's life in a manner that makes it compelling rather than interesting.",

    "review/text": "I'm a Chinese viewer living in Shanghai and I saw this film at the library of a nearby university. When I saw the film, I think it must be a classic or award-winning work because it has every element : superlime acting, intricate plot as well as unquestionablly excellent directoring &amp; shooting. Though I thought I'm not yet prepared to give some so-called review for this movie, I decided to at least tell about my feelings about it to Amazon thus to give some applause to this good movie. It moved me so much. I did not cry. I did not feel like to cry, actually. But I was silent all the night for the feeling it casted on me and for the things it made me thinking. Only after reading Amazon, I found it's a new work in 98' and God, I think it deserves more than a mere some adapting of script award in the Academy. I think Ian McKellen (I knew the name for the first time today)deserves a Best Actor. But maybe, the content of it is too controvertial even in U.S. Yet I think it is a great work for telling a story in a beautifully and craftly way which attempts those ancient and intriguing questions of love, the meaning of life, humanity and art, in a most unimaginable and moving plot. There're two scenes impressed me very much: One is when Whale and the young man taking shelter from a sudden rain in the garden party, he saw, from the veils of rain, a young man in uniform standing under another umbrella, he thought he was his old friend in the army in WWI and he could see the young man smiling to him, backing 60 years, in the battle-field, under the same grey and raining sky, he is smiling so affectionately and so beautifully. The other is at the end of the film, the old man is found dead in his swimming pool and pulled on the bank by the young worker. But threw into the pool again for fear of involving the young worker in the case. When the body of the dead old man was threw into the water, the way he is floating in the water is just like a bird flying in the air. And the music sounds, he seems so free, finally free of everything, worsening health, ghost of the past, all the losses in the life. He's so free, so beautifully flying in the blue water.",

Yes, there are quite a few scenes that may make the weak at heart flinch ! The real story or hidden message is not so much the gay attraction Whale has for Boone or the disgust Boone feels towards homosexuality. They both have a longing or yearning to have some type of normal male sibling companionship that they did not have with their own fathers ! Both characters had fathers who were tough and mentally abusive towards Boone and Whale. Boone's father thought he was a weak coward for being discharged from the marines while Whale's father ( and mother) ridiculed his talent for drawing and placed him in a factory to work at a young age. This is the common ground that both men share. Also, Boone gives Whale a mental jolt or flashback everytime Whale sees him of his days past as a young man (rejuvenation) while Whale (whether intentional or not) shows Boone how to be almost a gentleman and not a knuckledragger without class. However, the true (non-sexual) hidden agenda Whale has in mind for Boone and himself is a real exciting twister !The only downfall of the movie is that it is slow paced ( for some reason most Oscar material is; a thinking filmgoer's movie). Fraser deserves 5 stars for taking such a challenging role and losing the comical, big goofy guy role for a change. His young and fresh acting skills contrast with the other veteran actors for good intent and purpose to really add depth to the characters and story (his youthful persona contrasting with the seasoned and experienced). With all this said and including the top notch performances by all the actors this dvd version receives 4 stars ( bit of a slow movie, though).",

    "review/text": "This film is a very faithful adaptation of Christopher Bram's excellent novel Father of Frankenstein (which is probably why it got the Oscar for Best Screenplay Adaptation). Performances by Sir Ian McKellan, Lynne Redgrave and Brenden Fraser keep the action moving along at a fast but believable pace. When the film is done, the viewer feels quite rightly worn out from having run an emotional gamut. Sir Ian makes a splendid James Whale--a man of dignity, talent and superb artistry in the process of losing his mental capabilities, and all too aware of the gradual deterioration of his mind. Does Whale or does he not have the right to direct his final grand exit? That's a question society still struggles with. I especially liked the way Fraser portrayed a &quot;straight&quot;, very virile male unabashedly publicly befriending a gay man--something that gives plenty of &quot;straight&quot; males pause today. Vanessa Redgrave truly should have gotten the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, for which she was nominated for her work in this film. Her portrayal of the loyal but often disapproving housekeeper was flawless, superb and consistent. There is real power in McKellan's portrayal of a man very at peace with himself as a successful person in an environment that was for the most part hostile to homosexuals--claiming what was rightfully his against any existing odds. But you will take issue with the character's assessment about where his personal rights begin and end, as he manipulates Clayton in a drama that the trusting gardener has no idea is being played out. At the end of the film you are at odds with yourself about Whale's brillance and aplomb and good humor, which co-exists with his often callous and inconsiderate treatment of those closest to him. McKellan shines as a &quot;god&quot; and a &quot;monster&quot; rolled into one. Also, this movie is a terrific slice of life in Hollywood at its peak in the 1930's and 40's. This film lacks nothing that makes a movie great.",

While it is a fictional account of Whale's last days it seems to based on fact.Whale is most famous for his direction of the films, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and the 1936 version of Showboat.Ian McKellen is superb as the ex-patriot homosexual forgotten director. He portrays Whale as a man haunted by his past and desires. Fraser as the lawn boy who befriends Whale is great. Fraser's portrayal of a young man without purpose questioning his own sexuality is acting at its finest. Finally, Lynn Redgrave is great as the religious Hungarian housekeeper, sure Whale is destined for hell, but despite her employer's failings continues to show him love and compassion.Director Condon does a great job visually of portraying how Whale's humor came across in his films. But, more importantly shows how the backdrop for Whale's horror films were a reflection of his past.If you like me were led to believe that Karloff was the force behind our great horror film masterpieces see this DVD.",

    "review/text": "Only at the very end does it become abundantly clear exactly what this film is all about. Initially &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; just seems like a mild mannered tale between an old movie director and his gardener. Even if the film were that simple it would still be great. Fortunately there is something bigger at work here, a sly genius that only really seems clear when Brendan Fraser is walking around in the rain at the end and the credits roll up. When &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; finally reveals exactly what it's trying to say then it can really be seen as a classic Hollywood picture.Ian McKellen is unquestionably the star of the show here. He is so vastly superior to everyone on the screen that he alone carries the picture. He plays film director James Whale who has just had a stroke and is reaching the end of his life. After a while he begins to take an interest in his gardener, Clay Boone, played excellently by Brendan Fraser. Initially you wonder if Mckellen, a homosexual, is only interested in Fraser for gay purposes. In one scene prior to his arrival Mckellen takes great delight in forcing a film student to undress for him. That isn't the case though as Mckellen seems to be genuinly interested in Fraser's friendship. The two talk, Mckellen is very nostalgiac and tells Fraser stories about his time in lower class England as a child, his experiences in the war and his eventual exile from the Hollywood community.As the film progresses Ian Mckellen starts to gradually deteriorate. Overcome by memories of the past he eventually takes his own life by drowning in a swimming pool. His death, although saddening seems strangely appropriate given the circumstances of the film. In one great scene before his death, Brendan Fraser escorts Mckellen onto his former battlefield and lays him to rest next to other dead soldiers. While watching James Whale's most famous movies (The Frankenstein pictures) there is emphasis on one scene which intentionally runs paralels to the Fraser/Mckellen relationship. In one scene of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; the monster comes to the door of a blind man who claims that he is alone &quot;and no soul has spoken to me for years.&quot; It is obvious at this point that Fraser's sole purpose was to provide happiness and companionship to this agening man and evtually lead him into death.Well, enough ranting, &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is carried off in fine style. Some may find it long winded and slow, but Mckellen's charm and great scripting should be enough to get most film fans through. Vanessa Redgrave also turns in a great role despite it being significantly smaller than Mckellen's or Fraser's. There is one scene of reminiscing about boys in a swimming pool which maybe is a tad over the top but on the whole Gods and Monsters is a very effective and a very intelligent piece of work.",

First, you have one of the screen's great performances by Ian McKellen, and then there's the stunning revelation that Brendan Fraser has great depth and power as an actor and has been pretty much wasted in films up until now (except that he is terrific at comedy). This film on DVD is a marvel. The images are crisp and clean, the sound is clear and distinct, and the music score by Carter Burwell is one of the finest of recent years, subtly entwining itself into the psychological makeup of the characters and storyline. &quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is a movie of rare depth and directorial eloquence.

    "review/text": "Forget the dreadful \"Shadow of a Vampire\". This is the one to watch.Here Ian McKellen possibly does his best performance to date (Yes, it is better than Gandalf but not by much!) and so does Brendan Fraser. So two actors have their best roles ever in this movie and that says a lot about the quality of this film. This one has also got a few Oscars, even though that might not say much, it is still quite an achievement given that this film is pretty much a medium budget movie with limited locations and sets.The story is about the director James Whale who was primarily a horror director in the 1930s and 1940s. This is the story about the perils of old age, sexual discrimination, lust, anger, manipulation and love - all played out to the tune of a film that documents the reasons for this director's status as one of the all time greats.McKellen is frighteningly real at times. He has an old-age seizure on camera that looks stunningly realistic. The man is an impeccable performer and takes on his role here like a bull by the horns. You feel sadness and grossness for him at the same time. He is a manipulator, a conman, a sexual deviant- but also a great heart. Strangely enough this film has similar themes as Lord of the Rings. Tolken wrote many of the battle scenes, especially the Dead Marshes, because of his real experiences during the war. Whale is also attributing much of his own personal horrors that he paints on his canvas (both films and portrait artwork that he makes) to these artefacts of battle. There is a lot of depth to Gods and Monsters and plenty of emotion to boot. It spans across nearly every era between the early 1900s and the 1940s. Much of it is told in flashbacks especially the making of Whale's horror films.The plot is basically about Whale and his gardener (Fraser) and their relationship. It is a bit like asking questions and getting answers and showing a bit of skin in-between. Not only do both these actors stand out but Lynn Redgrave plays Whale's housekeeper in her best role to date too! She is an absolute side-splitting hoot and her cynicism is second to none.It would be hard to tell you much more about the plot without giving lots of it away but let's just say that you will learn a lot about everyone in this delightful film and it does come with a shock attached towards the end as the characters move a little closer to one another. The ending is moving and filled with sadness and loss with the passing of time. You can bring a lot to this movie and take a lot of it away with you too.This is an inspiring movie about talent, friendship and filmmaking. It is hard to find dramas much better than Gods and Monsters...",

A very touching movie by director Bill Condon whose Sister, Sister I had seen several years ago. I don't know why Sir Ian McKellen didn't win the Academy Award (I think Roberto Begnini won that year). This is probably his best interpretation EVER, so subtly, portraying a very solitary old man, director James Whale, overwhelmed by his own demons. Incredibly, Brendan Fraser (a comedian) is very good portraying the young and handsome gardener the subject of Whales affection. In my humble opinion he deserved being nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The other surprise is Lynn Redgrave as Whales' maid. She's just fantastic. The soundtrack (especially the last track \"Friend?\") is also very moving and at times so relaxing.Forget about Dream girls this is Bill Condon at his best. A must see!",

    "review/text": "Interesting film that won the Academy Awards back in 1998. James Whale was a director known best for his horror pictures such as Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. We look at a fictional gardener and how he interacts with Whale and how Clay (played by Brendan Fraser) deals with his own inner demons.The film plays best when it deals with Whale's World War I experiences and a few scenes where he is creating Bride of Frankenstein. Especially touching is the party he goes to and drags his gardener along. The actors who portray Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester were nearly the spitting image (though I imagined Karloff as taller than that).The film is really about Whale's homosexuality and in the Fifties America this is a taboo subject. The naked young guys and the nude Fraser may be hard for some to bear (and easier for others I assume).I was hoping for more of a docu-drama and less of a concentration on Whale's sexual orientation (of which 75% of the film seems to be) and wanting more horror movie-making.McKellen plays the role straight and Fraser's emotional range as an actor are pushed to the limit. Loneliness, memories and compassion with wry sarcasm played well by the housekeeper Lyn Redgrave. Great to see.The DVD also has a \"making of\" with the cast interviews, commentary, language subtitles and trailer.And just as in the early Universal films, the end credits say \"a great cast is worth repeating\". Little chestnuts like that were fun.Here's the original book:Father of Frankenstein",

    "review/text": "The Oscar-winning \"Gods And Monsters\" is a highly compelling film released in 1998 starring Ian McKellen (\"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy), Brendan Fraser (\"Looney Toones\", 2003), and Lynn Redgrave. It explores the last days of real-life director James Whale, the director of several films, the most famous being \"Bride of Frankenstein\". Ironically, he was one of very few openly gay filmmakers in Hollywood at a time when the issue was never expressed. The moments before his death, many major events happen in his personal life. He befriends a handsome gardener who learns a lot about life through this. Meanwhile, he suffers flashbacks from his days in World War II and his days on the set of \"Bride of Frankenstein\". Through this journey the characters learn more about themselves than any other time.This story is told beautifully. The flashbacks and the 1957 (their present) time are separated wonderfully, allowing audiences to slowly learn more about the characters and why they live in such turmoil. This emotional story explores issues that give the communities a positive outlook: namely GLBT issues. Therefore, this is a story about more than a former film director. This is a story about passion, friendship, yearning, sickness, trauma, and life itself. Everything combined leads to a powerful conclusion that will keep audiences thinking. Such overall film substance, thanks to director and writer Bill Condon, gives great homage to the original Christopher Bram's novel version of \"Father of Frankenstein\".Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave received an Oscar nomination for their performances in this film (Best Actor/ Best Supporting Actress). McKellen's portrayal of James Whale was expressed emotionally painful throughout the film, never losing his stance. His dramatic expressions give this film a more powerful theme. Brendan Fraser gives a powerful performance in this drama as the gardener. Though he's better known to participate in comedies, he separates the two themes beautifully. His acting quality is surprisingly better here than his comedies. Though Redgrave's role as Whale's nanny is brief, she makes an unforgettable presence. Her character's witty remarks are sometimes humorous. Yet, they don't disrupt the overall dramatic theme. Though the remaining cast performed well, this trio of actors stand out.Such overall film quality makes \"Gods And Monsters\" an unforgettable film that will surely please its audiences for a long time. Those people probably will not watch \"Bride of Frankenstein\" the same as everybody else.",

And, to prove this outing wasn't an aberration, he followed up 'Gods' with his outstanding 2002 turn as covert CIA man Auden Pyle in 'The Quiet American.'Also, for those of you who saw and enjoyed the bracing honesty of Bill Condon's much lauded 2004 release \"Kinsey\" (the rare biopic with little fictionalization license taken to 'boost' the narrative story), I urge you to take a step back to see this smaller (21-day shoot) release. It was 'Gods' that marked Condon's transition from screenwriter and small-screen director of movie-of-the-week genre to movie helmsman of critical repute. 'Kinsey' proves that 'Gods' was no fluke.

It is about a brave woman that loved her master so much and was willing to do anything to protect him even after he died. Ultimately it is about compassion.

So far as I can tell, $10m was allotted to film it, and it raked in a whopping $6m at the box-office.Well, so what. As Ezra Pound wisely commented about books, many years ago, \"Pay no attention to literary prizes, not even the Nobel.\" And how wise his words were! So I regard the fact that this film won an Oscar for its screenplay as nice, but not thrilling.It is not hard to see why the film failed at the box-office. There are no car chases, no explosions, no good-looking babes removing their wet T-shirts: it is very far from being a film for \"Joe Six-Pack,\" as another trenchant reviewer pointed out.What it is, is a masterpiece. I doubt that I will ever see Ian McKellen give a better performance -- unless I win the lottery and can travel to England for a live performance! :-) But, much more interesting than that, is the simple fact that the entire film is superbly acted, from the first frame to the last. There is not a bad performance in the lot; more surprisingly, there is not even a weak performance!I found the story to be extremely moving and involving -- approximately a hundred times more interesting than the clumsy mechanics on display in \"Brokeback Mountain.\" It is a movie with a gay theme...well, no. Let's say more than that: it is the story of an old man, James Whale, who is utterly and completely gay. \"Jimmy\" has suffered a stroke, and his mind is beginning to go. This overwhelming, unbearable reality is dealt with while two other people observe, take part, and try to help: his long-time maid, and his handsome gardener. This may seem like a very unlikely story to interest anyone, but for me it is simply one of the finest films ever made. My highest congratulations to everyone involved with the project. And I'll predict that, before long, \"Gods and Monsters\" will be made part of the Criterion Collection, and will begin its journey into film immortality. It is THAT GOOD.",

It was really quite chilling and what made him seem so human and sad. We get such a rare unique view of what it may be like to be completely detached from reality and lost in time for several terrifying minutes. And we get to see what it may be like for a man getting ready to die, before he, we, or anyone else knows it. That is what I thought made this movie such one of a kind.",

While I don't think that the stoty itself is fantastic, the performances by Frasier and Redgrave are definitelly worth watching. I must confess that I love Brendan Frasier, but even I was impressed by what he's accomplished in this film.There is this one scene with McKellen and Frasier in the middle, the climax, which the film was building up to. It is absolutely amazing. If there is ever a collection of most amazing scenes in the history of cinema, this scene should be one of them!If you like Hollywood's history, Whales' films, or simply creative cinema, you will really like this one. If you are a bit on the homophobic side, then, truth to be told, this film will not be easy for you to digest.",

    "review/summary": "Charismatic Performances from McKellen, Fraser, &amp; Redgrave",
    "review/text": "This was a superb film. Not only does it deal with sexuality issues, it delves deeper into the beliefs of the viewer. McKellen &amp; Fraser give outstanding performances as Whale and Boone. Although it has a superficial hint about Whale being a &quot;ditry old queer&quot; &quot;chasing young boys,&quot; the relationship that develops between Whale (McKellen)and Boone (Fraser)is not sexual. In fact, it goes beyond the sexual. Many heterosexual men would feel uncomfortable with some of the content, however, this is an excellent example of facing one's beliefs. Fraser's character is faced with the similar situation. Consequently, the characters grow beyond the superficial and move on. While I do not think that Fraser's character ever becomes comfortable with homosexuality, he learns to tolerate it. As for the nudity in it, I felt that it lent to the movie. Whale had been talking about the days gone by and suddenly gets this flashback of a pool party with handsome young men running around and swimming naked. The scene is brief, strategically lit, and well-staged. Even with DVD, the scene went by so fast we had to play it again in slow motion just to see anything. Even then, it was nothing much. So the straight men need not worry about this being a skin flick. As for Redgrave's character, she gives a powerful performance portraying a devout Catholic who works for Whale as his housekeeper. While her words are often muddled, the accent (I believe it's Hungarian) is the cause, not to mention the American colloquialization of the English language and the Brittish slang used. In her case, her actions, not her words, are the most important. The poignant turn of events toward the end, exemplifies her love and respect for Whale even though, according to her, &quot;he will go to hell for his sins of the flesh.&quot; It is because of this that she &quot;will go to hell too to look after him.&quot; Over all, Gods &amp; Monsters is a fantastic movie worth buying. Although it is a film for mature audiences, I think it forces one to think about how they would respond if put in a similar situation. Bottom line? -- If you enjoy a superb drama that requires some thought to enjoy, RENT IT or better yet, BUY IT! You won't be disappointed.",

    "review/text": "Amazing that such a great film could be made for only 3 million.Bill Condon directs with elegant simplicity, thoroughly allowing the viewer to revel in the dynamics of the story and in the development and playing out of the characterizations. This is a film which allows us to become immersed in the depth and richness of the very real human beings which inhabit this poignant, affecting story. No cheap melodramatic or pat resolutions here; everything looms unerringly real and on a believable human level. It helps of course that Condon has the actors to do it justice. Sir Ian McKellen faultlessly establishes Whale's persona; the nuances and facial expressions are revealing of a whole myriad of emotions, thoughts and feelings. He brings such a charge, such a presence, he almost doesn't need words, and yet, there is no discernible &quot;technique&quot; at play, no self-concious &quot;actory&quot; mannerisms. We are aware of something extraordinary here, a near-transference of another's persona into McKellen's own. He takes us to places in a way that Olivier once did. Lynn Redgrave is fixating as Hannah, the completely off-the-wall yet endearing servant. Redgrave is always careful never to let schtick mar what could be a caricature of this severely limited character; one can see a real person behind the granite wall of unimaginative denial. Brendan Fraser is the film's most pleasant surprise. Redgrave in the Special Features section of the DVD says of Fraser, &quot;He's a real actor,&quot; and this is certainly borne out in the finished result. With a powerhouse of artistic sagacity like McKellan, many a young actor could threaten to flounder helplessly, but Fraser not only holds his own astonishingly, he matches Sir Ian scene for scene. Most impressively, Fraser as his character appears to be paying rapt attention when McKellan's Whale speaks. His reactions are spontaneous and natural, the timing impeccably established. Moreover, Fraser declines to merely play the brooding hunk. When McKellan attacks Fraser's character in lascivious desperation, Fraser's depiction of his horror, trauma, outrage and pain is flinchingly palpable. It does not hurt either than Fraser is physically believable as the object of Whale's attraction.Don't miss this absorbing masterpiece.",

    "review/text": "In the history of Hollywood, director James Whale will always be remembered most often as the man who crafted the 1931 version of \"Frankenstein\", with Boris Karloff, and its superior, legendary sequel, \"The Bride of Frankenstein\". Though he helmed many other projects, including the original version of \"Showboat\", \"The Old Dark House\", and the terrific \"Invisible Man\" (both \"House\" and \"The Invisible Man\" featured a young Gloria Stewart, who returned to the screen in 1997's \"Titanic\") inevitably Whale is linked for all time with the definative depiction of Mary Shelly's monster. In later years Whale would brush these films aside, preferring not to talk of them and generally disdaining them, but the link is permanent. Ultimately, Whale committed suicide after a series of strokes, drowning in his own swimming pool, leaving no note. It is a speculation on these last days of Whale's, in the sunset of his career in Hollywood, that director Bill Condon deftly explores in this screen adaption of Christopher Bram's \"The Father of Frankenstein\". Whale, as well as being an expert director in his day, was also openly gay, at a time when both in society and Hollywood, discretion was the order of the day. Powerfully portrayed here by the peerless Sir Ian McKellan (also an openly gay Englishman), McKellan brings subtle nuances and complex shadings to a performance that is nothing less than breathtaking, bittersweet, and ultimately deeply moving. The story concerns his growing platonic friendship with a hunky young yardman, ably played by Brendon Fraser, who with his massive body and square, sculpted head (aided in no small part by a flat-top haircut) resembles nothing insomuch as a living embodiment of the Monster itself. Hired to tend the grounds of Whale's home by his nervous housekeeper Hannah (a brilliant Lyne Redgrave - both she and McKellan were nominated for Academy Awards - and in my opinion both were robbed), the two befriend each other and develop a relationship that will affect both their lives in a most distinct way. Solid acting is delivered by all, and the appearance of two of Whale's key stars - Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester (through expert makeup techniques) midway through the film is a highlight (it is eerie how close these re-creations are). It is also in this sequence, set at the home of movie producer George Cukor - a closeted queen himself - that McKellan effortlessly and masterfully delivers one of the films bitchiest - and funniest - lines. Amazingly, though, it is Fraser - paired with some serious top notch costars that he admirably just keeps pace with - who delivers the film's most heart-touching and profoundly moving scene. It is the very last scene in the film, and the effect that it has cuts right to the soul, speaking volumes about the depths of compassion and humanity inherent in only the most genuine of friendships. For this scene, this film shares the distinction of being one of those very rare movies - one that brought me to tears. Not out of sadness, but out of admiration for its reaffirmation of the deep level of compassion that is inherent within the human heart, no matter who we are, gay or straight. Highly, highly recommended.",

    "review/text": "Director James Whale brought to life some of the most enduring cinematic images ever known. Every time that we see Frankenstein's Monster (flat head, neck conductors, etc.) we are touched with the creative vision of his art. In this labor of love, Whales's life is depicted in a semi-biographical light and his final days are displayed with the help of a fictional friend. Flashes of his films and history are sprinkled about, aiding character development here and filling out the story there.&quot;Gods and Monsters&quot; is a work that entertains us with humor (I laughed out loud several times) while peppering us with serious ideas -- perceptions of homosexuality, encroaching age, impending death, unrealized dreams, etc. It all moves at a leisurely pace, but it never seems to be quite slow. The movie will occasionaly cause discomfort for heterosexual males, but there is often a humorous edge to these moments. Unfortunately, the picture will likely provoke disgust and disdain among those with inordinately homophobic leanings.This is a high quality film delivered by several key persons that have a great interest in its subject matter. It is excellently directed and beautifully photographed. Ian McKellen and Lynn Redgrave are superb in their roles, rendering humor, drama, and poignancy throughout. As lead actor and supporting actress, they were justifiably nominated for &quot;Oscars&quot; at the 1998 Academy Awards. Brendan Frasier, while not up to the level of his older colleagues, performs admirably. Not to be overlooked is the haunting (no pun intended) score that is enjoyable for its own sake and matches the mood of the film perfectly. Although devotees of the horror classics, and Whale fans in particular, are the most obvious candidates for purchase of this movie, it has enough merits to warrant viewing by any serious film-lover.The DVD version of this movie boasts strong picture quality that does justice the the considerable efforts of the cinematographer. The sound is good, and doesn't particularly suffer from the fact that the disc is only recorded in &quot;Dolby Surround&quot;. Among other things, the special features include an enjoyable and informative James Whale documentary, and an adequate director commentary. If you've enjoyed this film and are considering purchase of the DVD, you won't be disappointed with its qualities. Never seen it? In that case, rent it. And don't be surprised if you wind up buying it.",

The 30 minute documentary does not shed much light on Director James Whale's tormented life or work. The new FRANKENSTIEN DVD is much better in this regard.

The scene stealer in this blas&eacute; film has to be Redgrave, playing McKellan's Hungarian housekeeper. The film covers the recollections of the director of the original Frankenstein film. McKellen finds a confidante in Fraser, the yard/pool boy. While the recollections could have been riveting, somehow the delivery is flat, and you find yourself saying &quot;who cares?&quot; most of the time, without forming any affinity for either character's plight. Yes, McKellen is an openly gay actor, and yes, Fraser does a bit of a nude scene, but that's no reason to run out and buy this film. Rent it on a slow Saturday afternoon. It's watchable, but you won't want to re-watch it.",

Thank you, Clive Barker for signing on as producer to get this made, and thank you Lion's Gate (or whatever), for picking up this film as its distributor -- to think that this brilliant film, which is about so much more than Whale's homosexuality, would not have been made or found its audience. McKellen is magnificent, Redgrave is funny and heartbreaking and the glorious Brendan Fraser (who's smart enough to jump with both feet into films like this) proves without a doubt that he is the next very big thing -- the camera absolutely eats him up with every perfectly lighted shot.

But after that I was impressed with this multi-facited story.I thought Fraiser was excellent and believable as the big manly lug. McKellen's James Whale in GODS compares with Landau's Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD. Both actors take their young counterparts back to acting school to a certain extent. This is a movie that keeps you wondering where it is going next. And when those scenes are done their meaning could fuel a 2 hour debate.Being a fan of both good horror movies (Bride of Frankenstein) and cheesy ones (Plan 9 From Outer Space) didn't really come into play for GODS AND MONSTERS. This move is definately about MUCH MORE than a retired movie maker. Very enjoyable.Fraiser should stop doing kiddie flicks and do more serious stuff like this. He could be another Harrison Ford.",

It is helpful though not strictly necessary to have at least a passing familiarity with Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein - Whale's best known works are heavily used for metaphorical effect throughout. And an appreciation for good acting is a must.McKellen is excellent as a brilliant, proud man facing the deterioration of age and ill-health in a world where he is very much alone: even his loyal housekeeper of many years believes that he is going to Hell. His acting does much to prevent the movie from toppling over into melodrama (though a few scenes teeter on the edge.)My only real complaint with the film was that some of the minor characters included for comic effect seemed slightly heavy-handed, especially the young interviewer at the beginning. However, this is overall a very good movie about a man who is not remembered nearly as well as he should be.",

I never knew James Whale was Gay for many years till I read it mentioned in an article. It didnt matter. When this movie came out, my favorite actor Brendan Frasier, was in it so it was a must see.How sad to know that this great artist, was living alone in Los Angeles, not much better off then Lugosi was at the end of his life. His recollections to his Gardner played by Brendan, who was there more as a catalyst to tell James story then anything else, were heart wrenching as he described the young man he was in love with who died in WW1. \"We lost a whole generation in that war\" cannot help but bring tears to your eyes when you realize that WW1 was as much a horror as WW2. Whales sense of loss truly extended to all those who lived thru it with him as so many of Englands male population didnt make it back from the trenches, and he makes you feel the grief.I came away from this movie asking if anybody could have done anything to alleviate his alienation. Could fans in the area or travelling in California from out of state, stopping by to say hello, changed his mind about suicide if thats what it was.I know he was suffering physical pain as well, but maybe if fans had come by to let him know they cared, his ending might have been more peacefull and serene.The Gay aspect of his life was not played up to garner pity, it was not a major influence on the direction of the film at all. It was all about him and a studio that tossed him to the wolves when his known friends could not protect him from the morality patrol.The hypocrites in Hollywood who cheated on their wives, probably poked young stagehands and took drugs kicked the chair out from under James Talented body and left him to hang.By the time this movie was over I was crying like a little kid, and still makes me wonder. Could any of us fans, living in those time have made a difference by coming by and letting him know he was not alone and not forgotten.Rest In Peace James.",

There is so much more here than just a film for people looking for gay issues explored. Here we have the story of the fictionalized last days of Frankenstein director James Whale, but more specifically what we have is the story of a friendship between two characters who need something from each other. One who doesn't know how to live, and the other who doesn't know how to die. They both have something to bring to the relationship that ultimately helps the other to grow, although in a sad bittersweet context in the case of Ian McKellen's character.The movie is a wonderful showplace for Ian McKellen's talents as an actor, and he is mesmerizing as Whale. And Brendan Fraser unexpectantly demonstrates that he is much much more than just another sometimes goofy Hollywood pretty boy, in his portrayal of Clayton Boone. But it is the growth and development of the friendship between Whale and Boone culminating in the dramatic final scene between the two characters is what ultimately makes this movie unforgettable. The beauty of watching Clay rise above his fears of homosexuality and leave himself vulnerable in an act of love and compassion towards helping his ailing friend is breathtaking to behold, and the final resulting climax when Whale reveals what he really wants from Boone, will leave you in tears.In short, no matter what subject matter you're looking for in a movie, if you just love movies that are brilliantly acted, can easily pull you into a story line, and that stay with you long after the DVD has ended, buy this movie.

    "review/text": "Based on the intriguing novel FATHER OF FRANKENSTEIN by Christopher Bram, GODS AND MONSTERS is an excellent character study that explores the final weeks in the life of famed 1930s-era film director James Whale. Whale is, of course, best known today for his films like FRANKENSTEIN, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, and THE INVISIBLE MAN. When Whale quit directing at the peak of his career in the late 1930s, he retired to a somewhat reclusive but comfortable life at his California estate. Nearly two decades later, he was found dead in his swimming pool, and though ruled a suicide, the circumstances of his death have never been satisfactorily resolved. GODS AND MONSTERS seeks to recount those last days of Whale's life by filling in the factual gaps with informed speculation, and the result is a gripping and well-acted drama that won the 1998 Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.As the openly gay and artistically effete director James Whale, Ian McKellen delivers an Oscar-calibre performance (he was nominated but did not win). McKellen, himself candidly homosexual, plays the role with strong insight and conviction. Unafraid to show Whale's weaknesses as well as strengths, he adequately evokes the pathos necessary to make Whale a character that even the homophobes in the audience can learn to care about. Brendan Fraser also gives an affecting performances as Whale's heterosexual and rough-around-the-edges gardener Clay Boone. Though the character Clay is himself homophobic, he eventually develops a more-or-less platonic friendship with Whale and learns to value certain aspects of Whale's world view. Also of note is the appearance of Lynn Redgrave, who delivers an over-the-top--and Oscar nominated--performance as Whale's ultraconservative and disapproving housekeeper.Aficionados of the horror genre are likely to delight in the numerous clips from Whale's THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, as well as the excellent reenactments of certain events involved in the creation of that film. (It is THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, as any horror fan can tell you, from which the title GODS AND MONSTERS is drawn.) Buffs should also enjoy the fictional account of a chance dinner-party reunion of Whale and his &quot;monsters&quot; Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester.Carter Burwell's musical score for GODS AND MONSTERS is truly one of the most beautiful and haunting works from the contemporary cinema. It is at times soothing or melancholy, while at other times it is eerie, mysterious, and even downright spooky. In another era, Burwell's music would have just as easily worked for THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN or THE INVISIBLE MAN.But a word of caution is in order. In spite of all its good qualities, GODS AND MONSTERS is not the type of film that will appeal to all audiences. If you are a person who is easily offended by blatant allusions to the gay lifestyle or homosexual practices, certain bits of dialogue and a few scenes here and there are likely to disturb or upset you. On the other hand, if you are not homophobic and are tolerant of the depiction of alternate lifestyles in the cinema, you may find this film to be an affecting theatrical experience.",

There's so much food for thought in it : the character played by Fraser is all the more interesting as it shows how we all have to face our own monsters some day, particularly the fear of the unknown. In this particular case Boon is faced with the fear that some straight men might have, i.e., that a gay man may make them come face to face with their own emotions, their &quot;feminine side&quot;, not trying to turn them gay but just to help them explore an aspect of their personality that they are afraid to look at.A very sensitive movie with great lines (&quot;He's never met a princess before, mostly queens&quot;), and scenes that bring tears to the eyes (especially when Whale shows Boon his drawings, which turn out to be like &quot;the scribblings of a child&quot;.) A movie that stays with you for a long time after you have watched it.",

    "review/text": "The first time I watched this film on video I was completely drawn in. I found Ian McClellan as James Whale both sinister and appealing in a strange way. His &quot;stalking&quot; of Clay Boone, the gardener, made me extremely uneasy and the revelation of his actual plans for Boone appalled me - he was so unconcerned with what might happen to anyone other than himself. After a second viewing, I realised that this was primarily a movie about loneliness and the unlikely attachments between these three main characters. It's possible to watch this film on several levels and get a lot out of it - very thought provoking, and beautifully shot. McClellan and Redford are consistently wonderful - Fraser finally gets to turn in a non-comic performance with some heft to it. Anyone who has seen &quot;School Ties&quot; knows that Brendan Fraser can act - unfortunately, up until Gods &amp; Monsters he's mostly been tapped for his comic timing. His role in G&amp;M should have given his dramatic career some impetus, although it doesn't seem to have done so just yet.This movie is ultimately about the struggle to connect with others and make sense of our lives. If you feel up to thinking after a movie, get this one!",

Whale was the director of both \"Frankenstein\" and \"The Bride of Frankenstein\" whose career lost traction after his homosexuality became common knowledge in Hollywood. Sir Ian McKellan plays Whale as a sly, manipulative, middle-aged man dealing with the end of his creative life. Brendan Fraser is the straight gardener that is a fan of Whale's \"Frankenstein\" films and sees a world that he would not have experienced if he had not met the director. Fraser gives a strong performance as a young man trying to find himself, and is not always comfortable with Whales' attempts to manipulate him. Wish Fraser would take on my roles like this because he shows a different side of himself than he does when he takes on his usual lighter roles. Lynn Redgrave is also wonderful as Whale's housekeeper. She disapproves of her employer's lifestyle yet loves him unconditionally.McKellan and Redgrave both received Academy Awards for their roles. I would have liked to see Fraser nominated as well.This is a film that would be of interest to film buffs, fans that like good acting and for those who like their films with physcological overtones.",

    "review/summary": "Elegiac Father of Frankenstein",
    "review/text": "Bill Condon's Gods and Monsters is one of the most beautiful, elegiac films of the last fifteen years. It is a fictionalized, speculative film about the last days of the great golden-age Hollywood director, James Whale, who is best remembered for directing several Universal horror classics, such as The Old Dark House (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), and The Bride of Frankenstein (1935). When Gods and Monsters was released it received very good reviews, but several critics, obviously uncomfortable with the film's depiction of Whale's open homosexuality, managed to slip in comments regarding the director's \"hedonism.\" One wonders whether, if the film's subject had been the hetero charm of a Gary Cooper or Errol Flynn, would those same critics have written a praising pat on the back for the celluloid studs? Regardless, Gods and Monsters, while simplistic, is brave in its depiction of Whale's sexual preference; yet the film also strangely holds back from damning Hollywood's blatant hypocrisy regarding Whale's fall from grace.Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, and especially Lynn Redgrave give superlative performances. Fraser's Clay Boone is Whale's Frankenstein/Adonis of a gardener. Boone is slow on the uptake when it comes to realizing that his retired celebrity employer (McKellen) is more than just an odd artist. When Hannah, Whale's maid (Redgrave), lets the cat out of the bag, Boone's initial reaction is one of subdued violence. However, Boone soon finds himself missing Whale's anecdotes and returns to his employer's studio, securing a promise from Whale to \"go easy on the fag stuff.\"Whale gives a \"scout's honor\" but, of course, slips when reminiscing about a male lover in the great war. Boone utters the lines that every gay man or woman has heard from a homophobe, \"You must think the whole world is gay. I've got news for you, it's not.\" Boone is a failed Marine, and directionless in life. Whale's career accomplishments, along with his service as an officer in the war, attract the young man. The Whale that Boone now sees is aged, gay, and suffering the effects of a stroke, true, but he is still the type of figure Boone was hoping to meet in HollywoodLand.Due to the stroke, Whale frequently lapses into the not-so nostalgic past, which he has spent his life covering up. He poignantly describes his family to the transfixed gardener, \"I had imagination, creativity and wit. Where did I get that? Certainly not from them. It was like a family of farmers had been given a giraffe and did not know what to do with the creature, except harness it.\"Yet, it was hardly the pedestrian mindsets of poor, family Brits that ruined Whale. Whale was harnessed and then undone by the equally pedestrian corporate mindsets of the Hollywood studio system. Flinching from fully portraying Hollywood's betrayal of Whale's talent is where the film fails. The Road Back (1937) was a film that had been on Whale's mind and heart for some time. It was to be his personal statement against the war. Gods and Monsters tells us that much, but then short shifts the emotional, more complex truth. According to Condon's script the studio simply didn't like the film, added some slapstick, and the result was a bomb for which Whale was blamed, thus destroying his career.Actually, the truth is political. The Jewish heads of Universal studios were, in fact, threatened with a ban from the Nazis, due to The Road Back`s unflattering portrayal of Germany. The studio heads backed down and Whale was ruined. Hollywood has never been known for its moral courage. Charles Chaplin faced the same backlash with The Great Dictator (1940). Carl Foreman (High Noon, 1952) was among those blacklisted with the aid of Hollywood rethuglicans John Wayne and Howard Hawks. When Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ (2004) was released churches were taking kids by the busload to see this \"Lethal Jesus\" porn and Wal-Mart stocked its shelves when the DVD was released. The trillion or so dollars it racked in effectively silenced criticisms of its blatant anti-Semitism, and only now after Mel's repeated foot-in-mouth incidents can anyone point out the \"I told you so.\"Up against institutional politics, Whale was deemed the idiosyncratic freak. It was not Whale's sexual orientation, but his refusal to back down to the Nazis that sealed his fate. The atheistic director was put out to pasture by Executives, who just happened to be Jewish, who were fearful of offending Adolf Hitler. Ironically, by doing so, those same execs helped put their horror franchise permanently out of business. The post-Whale Frankenstein films were, in Whale's words, directed by second-rate hacks. The franchise's later films were copies of Whale's visionary originals, and it did not take audiences long to tire of the unimaginative repetition.This is a vital element in Whale's story and, alas, it is an often told story, especially in Hollywood. When executives interfere with the artistic vision, in a dollars and sense mindset, they wind up sabotaging their golden-egged goose. Whale, Orson Welles, Tim Burton (with the Batman franchise) and most recently Sam Raimi (with the Spider-Man franchise) are prominent examples. By toning down that elemental part of the story, Condon emotionally diminishes Whale's renegade spirit. Whale's sexuality was a vital part of him and Condon is to be applauded for depicting that, but homosexuality was only a fragment of that spirit. His stubborn artistry was what drove him and, eventually, got him banished.That (big point) aside, the rest of the film holds true. Whale's eventual decision is a noble one. By placing quality of life over quantity, Whale displays a brave, true morality. He wrong-headedly attempts to solicit Boone's assistance in helping carry out his plan. However, he sees Boone for what he is; a big pussycat. Whale repents for misjudging his gardener. Whale too could stereotype, and he realizes this most poignantly. Frasier excels here and he rounds out his character so well that one laments more roles like this did not follow for him. As excellent as Frasier is in the role of Boone, Lynn Redgrave is perfect in the role of Hannah. She is a pre-Vatican II, unattractive middle-aged Catholic widow. She chastises her employer's ways, but she truly loves him, and in a moment of crisis that she becomes fully Catholic, praying for Jimmy to have a better life ahead, and feeling he deserves it. We can relate. McKellen as Whale is mesmerizing and we can easily identify with Hannah's devotion to him. Redgrave completely disappears in her role, almost to the point of being unrecognizable. She intentionally bears a similarity to Whale character actress Una O'Connor, but takes that character to a unpredictable level. She is simply amazing, and when crisis comes her way, she tackles it with guts and empathy.By focusing more prominently on Whale's sexuality, as opposed to his artistry, Gods and Monsters, unlike Redgrave, falls a bit shy of hitting the mark. Still, it is an exceptionally intimate, sublime film that will make you fall in love with these people and, with that said, criticisms are rendered superfluous.* MY REVIEW ORIGINALLY APPEARED AT 366 WEIRD MOVIES",

For that matter, her entire \"Bad Girls\" 2 disc album was the absolute zenith of the Disco Era, and won unprecedented accolades from even those music critics who had always dripped nothing but disdain for everything disco.That said, however, her live on-stage performance presence always did leave something to be desired (can you say rather wooden) UNTIL her \"Live and More Encore\" (1999) era.In addition to finally leaving other personal issues behind, her work performing on the theatrical stage just before that 1999 \"comeback\" combined to truly make an amazingly astonishing difference and improved her concert stage work to true brilliance.Regardless, her voice has ALWAYS been beyond phenomenal.I was actually in the audience at the taping of this Hot Summer Night concert at the Pacific Amphitheatre back in 1983... if you watch it, look for the extremely tall guy (I'm 6'6\") in the audience wearing a very bright red jacket...you can't miss me... lol",

See my reviews of all of these recordings.Here is the breakdown of songs included on the set list from these albums;Donna Summer; Love Is In Control, State of Independance.She Works Hard..; She Works Hard..., Women, Unconditional Love.I'm A Rainbow; Romeo, Don't Cry For Me Argentina.Cats Without Claws (from 1984); Forgive Me.Romeo was also released that year on the soundtrack to Flashdance, and was added to the set list by requests from fans early in the tour. Don't Cry For Me Argentina, was also part of her 1981 greatest hits Tour, and became a show highlight, and to me the read here is the best. A short verson of her mega-hit opens the show (MacArthur Park), and On The Radio and a stellar Last Dance are also featured. A 4 song medly represents the landmark Bad Girls album, and contains Dim All The Lights, Sunset People, Bad Girls and Hot Stuff.Since the late 1980's, Donna has returned to doing her Greatest Hits as the basis for her live shows, and her concerts to this day have become a giant celebration, with the venues becoming huge dance halls. This concert gives us a rare view of what Donna had hoped to achieve in a decade domintaed by Madonna, and Prince.",

    "review/text": "The first exposure I had to this concert was on the 'Endless Summer: Greatest Hits' video which featured three of the tracks from this tape and I wasn't too impressed by them. Donna seemed quite bored at times singing 'MacArthur Park', although she did seem a bit more involved when performing 'Last Dance' and 'On the Radio' but still Donna didn't seem to be at her magical best so I wasn't expecting much from this (but I still bought it anyway 'cause i'm such a fan) but boy was I wrong! 'MacArthur' was the first track and it was probarbly a bit daunting for Donna at the start of a performance so that's maybe why she didn't seem as involved. It's when performing her new tracks (new as of 1983 that is) that she really shines. 'Unconditional Love' and 'She works hard for the money' Donna performs with all her usual brightness and verve. For 'Romeo' Donna runs up into the audience and she takes on an Evita like persona for her rendition of 'Don't cry for me Argentina' and the grammy winning 'Forgive Me' is a definate highlight. The band are good to and Donna introduces them all at one stage. The show is almost stolen by the backing singers Mary and Dara (who happen to be Donna's sisters) who are a delight as they sing and joke about with each other. Donna makes a few jokes about being black which nowadays may be considered un-PC and the dance at the beggining does seem very dated. Other than that this is a great show from the Queen of divas and I look forward to someday seeing the 'Live and more ENCORE!' VIDEO (which is unavailable in the UK format).",

Everything about this concert was perfect especially being introduced to Tina Arena.....what a set of lungs!!!! not to mention just how they harmonize pitch perfect. The whole concert is just a must have, recorded in California.Ive been waiting for the remaster onto Blu-ray, this is just the best, you cant help but feel good and be overwhelmed by the musicians and singers. I keep buying copies of this VHS looking for one that is in pristine shape until they get their collective (you know what together) and produce a perfect transfer into Hi-Def sound and video. Cant wait....its way over due fellas...get to it!! In regard to the tape sent me buy the seller, I havent had an opportunity to watch it yet, but the seller has earned respect with their ratings so I took a chance on the strength of the sellers reviews. Thanks for a clean product, in very good cosmetic shape so hopefully that will come through when playing it. Thanks...J.Casper",

    "review/text": "Donna Summer has never really been able to define herself in the video era. In the pre-video 70s, she was easily the top pop female artist with powerful vocals and a full repertoire of disco-pop styling. But in the video era, where fashion and dancing are more important than vocals (Madonna anyone?) Summer clumsily moved from rag-tag Wanderer (1980), to funk queen (1982), to weary waitress (1983). Her vocal versatility was difficult to carry over to the video world where image is everything. This disparity is apparent in her live concerts as well. In the 1983 concert tape, &quot;A Hot Summer Night&quot;, shot at an SRO concert in Costa Mesa, CA, Summer tries a bit of Vegas showgirl with sequine-covered gowns, rock diva, and Evita(!). Sometimes Summer tries a Bette Midler camp, telling naughty anecdotes in breathy Mae West tones, and sometimes she's Cher, eager with that audience participation. While the concert tape is never dull, it's a shame that Summer didn't stop playing the chameleon and recognized that she could have a very strong image of her own. END",

Great pacing, great comedy, entertaining characters that you can't wait to see what they do next.I watched with the Japanese language, so the English dubbing that came out more recently sounds strange to me. However it is a great show. They may sound a bit different, but the characters are still there.I've introduced it to family and friends, and all that have watched it loved it from beginning to end.There's many ways to watch this show, but this is worth adding to an anime collection. If for no other reason than to be able to watch it with the Japanese language commercial free.p.s. If you don't love Apachai, you have no soul. :P",

    "review/text": "An anime series about a boy learning martial-arts from a gang of masters sounds... kinda boring. Fortunately it's anything but -- \"Kenichi: Season One\" is a solid start to this deliciously oddballish series, with plenty of gutsplitting comedy, explosive action, a hint of romance, and extremely eccentric martial artists. And the \"weak knees\" main character makes it easy for you to root for him.Throughout his school life, Kenichi Shirahama has been weak, bullied, friendless and nicknamed \"weak knees.\" He enters the high school karate club to become stronger, but quickly finds himself at the bottom of the food chain -- and challenged to a match by a big muscled thug.But his life is unexpectedly saved by the new transfer student Miu, who can beat down an entire street gang. She guides him to the Ry'zanpaku dojo where she lives... and where five great martial arts masters currently reside, each at the peak of their skill and strength. Unsurprisingly Kenichi joins up with the hope of becoming stronger, but he soon discovers that their methods are kind of brutal (think racing around the city pulling jiujitsu master Akisame in a tire!).Unfortunately, his martial-arts win only leads to more trouble -- he attracts the attention of various thugs, and gains the attention of the strongest gang in the city, Ragnarok. And moving into the dojo doesn't end the danger, as he finds that some of his friends -- including an ex-member of Ragnarok -- are being targeted by their thugs. What's more, he has no idea how close one of the gang's elite fighters is...\"Kenichi: Season One\" is a strong first half to the anime series -- it quickly introduces us to the characters and scenario, then plunges right into the world of martial arts training. But on a deeper level, \"Kenichi\" is also about a young man who gains not only physical strength but mental endurance, and how his innocent quest to be strong rapidly escalates into something far more life-changing.And.... it's funny. REALLY funny. Every episode is packed with slapstick, insane training (the Great Leg Divide -- a sort of medieval torture device), eccentric characters (\"Riiiiiise, SEBASTIAN!\"), and tsunamis of hormones whenever Kenichi gets within two feet of Miu. All this humor keeps the series from getting too deadly serious. There's also a lot of action that twists through the various episodes, as Kenichi is confronted by all sorts of opponents -- karate, boxing, street fighters, knife-wielding thugs -- and has to use different techniques to defeat them. Lots of special punches, low kicks, pivots, body-weight throws and other fun techniques.But Kenichi himself is a strong point -- he's a likable and earnest kid who hasn't been soured by his constant mistreatment at school, and who just wants to be strong enough to defend himself and other people. And it doesn't go to his head, since he shows immense compassion towards the people he defeats. Miu is also an excellent female lead in the vein of Tite Kubo's Orihime -- busty, friendly, industrious, naive, and just a little bit weird.And the supporting characters have a brilliance of their own: there's Miu's imposing grandpa, the rough and blunt Sakaki, the silent sword-swinging Shigure, the lecherous Kensei, and the vast and deadly child-man Apachai (\"Only limit is limit of fear!\"). Takeda the Puncher makes a good buddy/rival for Kenichi... and for the record, all the voice actors are simply brilliant..\"Kenichi: Season One\" is a solid start to a thoroughly enjoyable series, crammed with martial-arts fighting and loads of comedy. A fun, wild little anime series that deserves immediate watching! Apapapapa!",

    "review/text": "An anime series about a boy learning martial-arts from a gang of masters sounds... kinda boring. Fortunately it's anything but -- \"Kenichi: Season One\" is a solid start to this deliciously oddballish series, with plenty of gutsplitting comedy, explosive action, a hint of romance, and extremely eccentric martial artists.Throughout his school life, Kenichi Shirahama has been weak, bullied, friendless and nicknamed \"weak knees.\" He enters the high school karate club to become stronger, but quickly finds himself at the bottom of the food chain -- and challenged to a match by a big muscled thug.But his life is unexpectedly saved by the new transfer student Miu, who can beat down an entire street gang. She guides him to the dojo where she lives... and where five martial arts masters currently reside, each at the peak of their skill and strength. Unsurprisingly Kenichi joins up with the hope of becoming stronger, but he soon discovers that their methods are kind of brutal (think racing around the city pulling jiujitsu master Akisame in a tire!).Unfortunately, his martial-arts win only leads to more trouble -- he attracts the attention of various thugs, and gains the attention of the strongest gang in the city, Ragnarok. And moving into the dojo doesn't end the danger, as he finds that some of his friends -- including an ex-member of Ragnarok -- are being targeted by their thugs. What's more, he has no idea how close one of the gang's elite fighters is...\"Kenichi: Season One\" quickly introduces us to the characters and scenario, then plunges right into the world of martial arts training. But on a deeper level, \"Kenichi\" is also about a young man who gains not only physical strength but mental endurance, and how his innocent quest to be strong rapidly escalates into something far more life-changing.And.... it's funny.

Underneath that physical powerhouse is a heart of gold and a fist of steel... not to mention legs that could break a stone wall into a million pieces just by smacking it with them once or twice. And as fate may have it, she's a sweetie too. She has taking a liking to our hero and therein lies the problem. Because of this attraction, this has made him the hatred of every guy in his class as if they didn't hate him enough already. So Miu could only think of one thing to do for him... take him to train with her at her grandfather's dojo.Laughter and pain is felt all around as the story is told through the first 25 episodes and it's some of the most fun I've had in years!

I love the work of Dominic Anciano and Ray Burdis (including the British tv series \"Operation Good Guys\") and think they're very underrated. This move is excellent on several levels. #1 It's creative and something that hasn't been done before- the concept of what people would REALLY be like if we were secretly taped (not the MTV Real World cra.p of someone losing their temper -oooh!-, getting drunk or being caught after a one night stand) but someone on the toilet, knicking a few bob from a friend, talking about disabled people, hitting his girlfriend or sticking a pool cue up his behind on a dare from friends. It's about exposing hypocrisy. In all their work Burdis and Anciano have a real flare for truly realistic characters, dialogue and situations while still bringing in some fresh air. #2. The plot is great and you don't see what's coming in the end. It unfolds beautifully I think. B&A also use the same group of actors in their work which gives their stuff an edge I think. You feel like you're sitting around with a group of friends. Make more films you guys!!!!",

The female leads all acted as if this were the first time they had read their lines - Sadie Frost, in my opinion, was terrible! Surely they could have found some actresses who would show a little emotion and seem sincere when they did show a little emotion. So, I give this film kudos for such an original idea and the unique way in which it was filmed and presented, but otherwise, I have to give it two thumbs down :-(",

Jude's wife Sadie anounces that as a request by Jude she will show a tape that he had worked on for the last 2 years of his life. Sadie has already seen the tape and declares that it has comforted her through this time, which is untrue and only sets up what comes next.when the tape begins its as you would expect this sort of thing to be. a naration by Jude and even a friendly little melody and montage to start things off. from here, though, the tape begins to reveal the true side of each person in the room, some funny, some embaracing, and some that will ruin bonds of friendship forever. it even includes a secret of Jude himself, which sets up a fanale` with a twist that will slap you square in the face.the acting in this film is superb. to be able to pull off such a real shock, anger, disbileif, and ebarisment is a reflection of the talent of the actors on board. as you begin to learn of and know the characters you find yourself wondering, \"could this be for real?\"this movie was briliantly done and one i am glad that i stumbled accross, though gets little publicity. if you do see this, and enjoy it recomend it to your friends, it might be the only time they hear of it. also if this movie intruiged you here are a couple of other movies that play as a biography: \"Insident at Loch Ness\" and \"The Last Horror Movie\"hope this has helped you helped you.if you would, give me some feedback of your own,(...) thanks",

(I mean, who can you really trust..?) One of the reasons I think the film works so well is because the actors (in both movies) are all friends in real life and part of what's called the \"Primrose Hill\" set. Note too that the characters all take the names of the actors. For those who are Ray Winstone and Jude Law fans, these early performances helped launched their careers and rightly so. A great movie (if you don't have to be entertained by non-stop action, special effects, etc. and you can understand the dialogue and accents!).",

Not you, yourself, persay, but in general. To enjoy this movie you have to go into it with an open mind and not dwell on analizing what made the main character (Jude Law) do what he did. The role of each character, I suppose, is all about the reality of human nature. For what this movie was trying to accomplish I guess it was done fairly well. Before purchasing the movie I read up about it on the internet-my conclusion-I was intrigued by the oddity of it and I believe Jude Law is a very good actor.

But his death is an accident. So why was he making a movie like this? Coincidence? HUH? No logic. And so his wife, Sadie (5 stars for Bad Acting Hall of Famer Sadie Frost...man, she is just uncomfortably laughably bad) finishes his film? It is implausible in the extreme.She calls the cops...when...? ...to catch Ray as he makes his exit? Is she clairvoyant? Lame. As if the cops would wait for her to set all this up. No. And they send what amounts to a SWAT team. HUH?But. A side note. Anything with Ray Winstone is worth watching. Even this. But just for his crackling, pent-up, electric energy. He is scary and beguiling and you don't really take your eyes off him for a moment. He swears creatively, admirably and with great enthusiasm.

    "review/text": "If you are a fan of Golden Earring this is a video to own if you can get hold of it! I own the original 1984 pressing long out of print and got it for a birthday present way back in the day! This I first saw on MTV back when and this is not a regular boaring old concert video. It starts off with a nice 5 min filmed scene that is based on the classic \"Twilight Zone\" video then goes into the concert and througout the concert there are many people from this band's great original video clips. Not to mention, im not a fan of live music..but Golden Earring was one group that performed just as great live if not better on some tracks (the live version of \"Long Blond Animal\" is absolut classic and beats the original studio recording). So if you remember Golden Earring or are still a fan like myself following them in their still music making overseas to this day..if you don't own this and can get hold of it somehow, it's highly recomended!! Also, don't miss Cezar's kick ... drum solo/show in the middle of \"Radar Love\"..i've loved that part since I was a kid!",

    "review/text": "One of the first albums I ever bought was Abraxas, way back around '71. I loved Carlos's fiery guitar playing and aggressive, percussive rythms, and bought all subsequent Santana releases until the early 80s. At that point I felt Santana became too \"pop\" oriented and I lost interest. I guess I can't blame Carlos for his more recent incorporation of world and hip hop in his music, if you want to sell records and survive as a musician, you have to give the people what they want, and virtuoso lead guitar doesn't sell like it did 30 plus years ago.When I saw that the new \"Live by Request\" DVD included older songs like Soul Sacrifice and Evil Ways and my all time Santana favorite \"Europa\" I decided I had to check it out.To my surprise Carlos plays extremely well, and the old songs have lost very little over the years. One of the newer pieces (DA LE) Yaleo includes some nice jazz/rock fusion, sounding a little bit like music from the Lotus release way back when. Carlos is wearing a John Coltrane \"Love Supreme\" T shirt, which seems to set the tone for some fine playing and indicates that, despite surrounding himself with a lot of new \"pop\" stars, he hasn't forgotten his roots and inspiration. When the hip hoppers jump on stage, I simply jump to the next track. All in all, a very enjoyable DVD for an old Santana fan like me. The camera work and sound are very good, but I rate the DVD 4 stars because the set is only about an hour long.",

I'm Jorge from Tucuman - Argentina. I've requested \"Oye Como Va\". Why I'm disappointed ?, because Sony BMG made a cheap edition, doesn't have good sound, no Dolby 5.1, just only a simple Stereo sound LPCM.Is not like the others early DVD edition from that show Live By Request, as, Bee Gees, Tony Bennet, Don Henley, Earth, Wind & Fire, etc, they Edited those DVD complete, whith all the phones call and the interview to the bands.I hope they can fix this error of edition, doing another DVD as Special Edition.I like the sound of Santana of the 70's, and the excelent arrengment that he made on Santana Brothers. I saw him in USA 33 years ago (1972), and I'm going to fly 1.200 km to see him in Buenos Aires the 11th of March of 2006But, for this Live By Request bad edition, I rate this DVD with a 3 stars and because the sound is only LPCMThank you very much",

Just listen to the organ improvising theme of OYE COMO VA, EVIL WAYS and SOUL SACRIFICE, and you'll understand what I mean. No underestimation of other band members.. All of them are great. I rated the band 5 stars, and Arista company which produced the DVD 3 stars making a mean of 4 stars for the item. I can't believe how to produce a music DVD on the end of 2005 without a 5.1 channel sound format.I think that great Santana deserves to be listened at his utmost,and the DVD shouldn't be produced with only stereo sound.

I hope this is the final installment and so Carlos can get back to being an artist.I purchased the promo CD that Target offered and I was very suprised at how bad this set is. The sound is terrible to start. The first track, \"Smooth\" is ok, however there should have been a bridge to \"Tu Amor\" to make it sound logical instead of a gap. Carlos sounds weak on guitar through out - could be the editing.....or lack of. Or...it could be this is Santana's way of expressing his frustration of being a pawn for the record company. And the brass section......need I say anymore?I did see a copy of the DVD at the store and the whole package looks cheap. Poor photo's, packing, and overall presentation. Based on it's appearance I would have guessed it was a bootleg than an offical release from the record company. Yieks!!A by track critique:\"Smooth/Tu Amor\" - sloppy, over kill on the horns, and no bridge to \"Tu Amor\" - which makes the whole song sloppy.\"Black Magic Woman\" - probably the best track. Sounds like Greg Rolie on vocals?\"Oye Como Va\" - the other good track on this set.\"Maria, Maria\" too ghetto to be cool. The Product G&B; are too busy 'keepin' it real' and cause a big distraction to the song - the crowd seemed to love it, however.\"The Game of Love\" - sounds like a rehersal more than anything else. Michelle Branch who is usually good sounds terrible and Carlos.......is he plugged in? I can't seem to hear him.\"Europa\" - terrible arrangement. Carlos isn't allowed to shine. I guess the 20 something crowd has never heard this song - on the \"Sacred Fire\" disc the crowd knows the opening riff. At the end of the song the band receives a \"golf clap\" and rightfully so. This song is usually a show stopper.\"Soul Sacrifice\" - terrible arrangement. Over kill on so many levels.If you want a great live CD, get \"Sacred Fire\" or \"Supernatural\".",

    "review/text": "If you enjoy Carlos Santana, there are three DVD's to get: Supernatural Live, Sacred Fire, and now, Santana, Live by request. This DVD gives you a very true look at what most Santana concerts are like(with the exception of the varios guest performers). Concert videos are great in that, they show how well performers perform in real-time settings. Any garage band can make a video but when you're in front of a live audience, that's a different story.Good camera work, nice angles, good sound mixing and a very professional overall production. I would have liked to have seen an additional half hour but it was put together by A&E; for TV so there's your time limits. Glossy but not over produced.I've heard people comment that he sounds the\"same\" over the years. What these people don't realize is Santana has crafted \"his sound\". No one else sounds like Carlos Santana, hearing just one sustained note, you can tell right away it's him. Carlos' sound basically is, a choice of three or four PRE Santana I guitars(sorry kids, the PRS guitars he uses are nothing like the Santana models available at the local Guitar Center). Paul Reed Smith probably set up & tweaked the guitars personally. For amps, he has two Dumble Overdrive Reverb heads plugged into two BrounSoun Cabs each with four ToneTubby Hemp Cone speakers and an original Mesa Boogie Mark I head plugged into a single 12\" Altec speaker in a square cabinet. For effects, (he uses very few), an Ibenez Tube-Screamer, an old Mutron Wah pedal, and rumor has it, a T-Rex Replicator delay pedal. The rest is pure musical talent.If you've followed his career, you see a definite evolution in his playing style. It is \"not the same old stuff\". He has amazing feel for the music, he knows when to turn-it-up on his solos and when to temper it. Listen closely, his solos are all different. He'll incorporate his unique styling licks but it's not like the same solos played over and over again that you hear from so many other current guitarists.This DVD is really an accurate look at what his concerts are like. He plays often here in his native Northern California and most of concerts are in smaller, more intimate, theatre venues as in this video. \"Santana, Live Request\" is definitely a niceaddition to your music collection.",

    "review/text": "On a good day, \"Blackbelt II\" would get two stars instead of one. The film has some B-movie charm to it and, realistically, isn't the worst you can go when it comes to low-budget action pictures. Today, however, is a bad day for me, and the technical laziness and storyline hodgery of supposed kickboxing champion Blake Bahner's guns & karate vehicle weigh in on my nerves enough that I don't feel very generous. Chances are you've never heard of this movie before, and so with good reason: there is nothing special about the film and nothing can be gained by watching it.The story: when the partner of renegade LA cop Brad Spyder (Bahner,Wizards of the Lost Kingdom 2) is murdered while investigating the reappearance of his thought-dead Vietnam veteran brother in Hawaii, he makes it his mission to find out what happened, and discovers a deadly crime syndicate trying to swindle money out of a desperate grieving father (Paul Holme, \"Stairway to Heaven\")...The meat of the plot is that this syndicate (led by no-namers Gary \"Skinner\" Rooney and Michael \"Friedkin\" Vlastas) has promised the aforementioned father the return of his son, who went missing in Vietnam, but plan to trick him with the false testament of a fake POW (the brother of Spyder's partner) before stealing his money. The idea's farfetched but has some potential, but it's presented in such a convoluted manner that few viewers will be troubled to continue to follow it's development after the first half-hour. There's a political half-statement regarding the expendability of soldiers and the putting forth of the conspiracy theory that, when too many soldiers deserted the military in `Nam, they were declared MIA to cover up the embarrassment; whether or not this can be considered offensive is up to you.However, what kills the movie dead is its poor production. Far too many scenes are shot under dark lighting and have a bleak, washed-out look that makes this 1993 film seem like it was made in 1980. Expect incorrectly-synched sound effects galore. Worse still is the movie's atrocious editing, which not only cuts each and every shot half a second too early but also denies the film any ebb or flow via chronic inconsistencies in the positioning of characters and a general lack of comprehensible pace. This carries over to the action scenes - the movie's last, failed chance at any cinematic worth. A combination of bloody-but-unremarkable shootouts and worthless fistfights disappoints something awful. Blake Bahner has some decent kicks and more or less looks the part of the next Van Damme-wannabe, but save for so-so brawl he has with Gary Rooney at the end of the picture, the four fights either make dreadful overuse of the \"many shots, one strike, quick edit\" technique or are simply presented so lifelessly and without intrigue that it's very difficult to care who wins.With the exception of \"the jolly evil fat man of Filipino exploitation cinema\" Vic Diaz (Live by the Fist), the cast is made up almost exclusively of bit-players and the acting is roundly questionable. The subliminal weirdness of how the story plays out and how the movie was stitched and slapped together might ultimately appeal to hardcore C-movie lovers, but I think it says something that even a simple action fan like me found nothing to like about \"Blackbelt II\". Rest assured, it has no connection beyond its title withthe original Don Wilson outing- therein eliminating its final glimmer of possible intrigue. Continue to ignore this movie; it might as well not even exist.",

    "review/text": "I really enjoyed this video. The \"talking\" portions were short but enlightening, and I learned a lot of good material from it. I'd highly recommend it to you as well if you:- are an intermediate, advanced, or professional belly dancer( Aradia does not break down most of the movements, so beginners and advanced beginners may need to ask their teachers for help breaking down the moves)- are interested in seeing Egyptian, Lebanese, and Turkish belly dance compared and contrasted- would like to learn some attractive, versatile combinationsWhat you get:- A quick introduction to the aesthetics of the Egyptian, Lebanese, and Turkish styles of belly dance- 3 combinations in each style- A full-song performance in each styleWhat I Liked:- The video made the difference between the three styles VERY clear. I've studied with several teachers, each of whom has a different interpretation of \"Arabic\" belly dance, and now I understand why, given what I know about their influences.- The combinations are cute, they fit the music Aradia has chosen, and they could easily be adapted to go with other music. They move quickly, and some are not easy to execute, but they are well-structured, so they won't fly over your audience's head.- For each style, Aradia begins the performance with the combos she just taught. That helped me understand what she was doing as she expanded on those ideas later in the piece.- The Turkish section used music in 4/4 time, which is often neglected. (Most Turkish videos focus on 9/8, but that's not all there is to Turkish dance!) Also, Aradia danced to \"Geceler\" which is one of my favorite Turkish songs, and it was a treat to see it interpreted by someone so talented and well-versed in Turkish style.- Aradia spent just the right amount of time breaking down and practicing each combo. I didn't feel rushed or bored.What I Didn't Like:- The Egyptian & Lebanese style sections used pop-y/remix-y music. I would have preferred more classical/traditional selections.- Each \"chapter\" was actually a title on the DVD (rather than a proper chapter), so the \"step forward\" button on my remote didn't work.- When facing you, Aradia says \"right\" when she's working on the viewer's left. This is pretty common on video, but it gets a little confusing when she turns around and her right actually IS your right.- Aradia's performance in the Egyptian section seemed a little prissy. The moves and musical interpretation were perfect for the genre, but her performance was missing the \"goo\" and the emotional intensity you find in good Egyptian dancers.(This is not to criticize Aradia's dancing. I've seen clips of her performing in Egyptian style and she absolutely had the \"goo\" and the \"love\"; those qualities just didn't come through in this performance.)I'd love to see Aradia do additional volumes on this theme. Maybe one comparing & contrasting how the styles use slow music, another for drum solos, zils etc.?",

    "review/summary": "Guile and Cunning...",
    "review/text": "\"The Man Who Never Was\" is a nicely-done movie dramatization derived from the book of the same name by former British Intelligence Officer Ewan Montagu. Montagu (played in the movie by Clifton Webb) was tasked in 1943 to divert German forces from the defense of Sicily, the next Allied objective. Montagu and his team came up with the disturbing but unique idea of planting false papers on a dead body disguised as an Allied officer, then allowing the body to wash ashore in Fascist Spain in the hopes that the information would be passed to the Germans.The first two thirds of the movie follows the efforts of Montagu's team to find a suitable body and prepare its legend as one Major William Martin, Royal Marines, carrying letters to high officers in the Mediterranean Theater. Amid the disruptions of blitz-torn London, the team deals with details such as procuring a special canister in which the body can be placed, packed in dry ice, for movement by submarine to the Spanish coast. The team invents a girlfriend for the young officer; a roommate (played by Gloria Grahame) of Montagu's secretary obligingly writes the love letters that the dead Martin will carry with him.This operation, codenamed MINCEMEAT, was a high-risk venture in that there was no assurance that the body would wash ashore, that the materials would be passed to the Germans, or that the Germans would consider the documents credible. In the actual event, the success of the deception was not truly apparent until after the war. The last third of the movie fills this dramatic gap by having a fictional Irishman spying for the Germans (played by Stephen Boyd) check on Martin's bonafides in London. The team finds out about the spy late in the game and must persuade British Internal Security not to arrest him. An emotionally-charged meeting with the roommate, grieving over the loss of her real boyfriend, turns out to be the key to the spy's mission.This movie is highly recommended as an entertaining and dramatic tale of wartime guile and cunning, based for the most part on a real life event.",

A shiny Gloria Grahame co-stars as the woman who seems to be engaged to the man who never was, since they must create an identity for him. Sound confusing? It's not really as it unfolds in the film. The plot is quite interesting, especially given the fact that we know it's mostly true, although things happen quite quickly and it seems that this operation was much easier than I suspect it was. It's certainly not the greatest war/spy film ever made, but it is fun to watch the plot unfold and come together. It was definitely a brilliant, risky plan.",

    "review/text": "Handsome movie, made in the 1950s, about Operation Mincemeat, the successful deception plan concocted by the British during World War II to send a corpse to the Mediterranean with false invasion plans. The Germans swallowed it whole, and left Sicilia (where the invasion finally took place) relatively unguarded.Made by Hollywood with relatively unknown actors, this film is very entertaining, even if some of the things here turned out not to be true, though this was probably not the fault of the filmmakers. For instance, the corpse that was used in the operation belonged to a Welshman instead of a Scot (an alcoholic tramp, in actuality), and his family was not notified. And the last half hour deals with the story of an Irish spy in London working for the Germans that, while entertaining, is pure invention.More a spy film than a war film, it can be compared, as some of the commenters have noted, to some of the best movies by Alfred Hitchcock, in the way the film builds suspense over the operation. The beautiful color photography is an enormous plus; since this was filmed just a decade after the conflict ended, this allows you to have a very good idea of what London must have looked like during the war in full colors. Some might find the patriotism in the film a bit old fashioned, but I found it refreshing in comparison with the constant cynicism and weariness of contemporary movies.",

This means using its naval forces tomove stealthily around its continental enemiesusing naval forces and to try to use deceptionto get the enemy off guard, rather than confrontingthem head on. The failed First World War operation at Gallipoli wasa good example of this, trying to strike at Germany\"through the back door\", rather than just head onin the blood-soaked trenches of Flanders on theWestern Front.In the Second World War, all the British leaders andsenior officershad been traumatized by the slaughter of theFirst World War and were desperate to come up withways of avoiding a replay. Thus, in 1943, after NorthAfrica had been cleared of Axis forces, the Britishmilitary leaders sought a way to distract the Germansfrom the obvious next target, which was Sicily.The result was deception of \"Operation Mincemeat\" which is portrayedin this excellent film. The film is based on EwenMontagu's book \"The Man Who Never Was\". This filmis of a long-lost genre of films which are rivetingin spite of the fact that they don't have any \"action\",(i.e. shoot-outs, fist fights, car chases, etc), like another of my favorites \"Twelve Angry Men\".A close observation of the film shows, beside the mainstory, a lot of other information showing what wartimeBritain was like, such as how London became run-downand grimy during the long years of bombing and austerity,how the British learned to take the air raids in stride,the resignation to the on-going deaths of relatives andfriendsand the shortages of quality consumer goods. In addition,we see the manifestations of the traditionally tense relationship betweenBritain and Ireland as well as Scotland. For militarybuffs, there is a brief look at the legendary Mosquitofighter/bomber and the unsung British submarine force (ascompared to those of the United States and the GermanU-Boat force).One thing to keep in mind is that while Montagu makesno mention of German efforts to authenticate the existenceof \"Major Martin\", the film devotes a considerable partof its plot to that, which I assume is \"overdramatized\"to keep the interest of the audience. The film claimsthat the German (actually Irish) agent actually gets incontact with someone who had a part in the whole operation,and I doubt whether this is factual. However,this is a minor point and does not detract from the excellence of the film.",

I have just watched the DVD. The movie remains taut, swift, detailed, unfussy, truly a remarkable yarn very well told and acted. No gore, no chases, no explosions, the tech is low, the methods rigorously parsed and distilled, but at the core remaining improvisatory, as one reads they were during the war. This film sees itself as having no need to impress in any way other than by having believable, life-sized characters, develop the tale efficiently and well. So refreshing, these days.The movie hasn't aged. Seeing it as a kid led me to read the book. I don't think I will re-read it, but I can certainly envision playing the DVD again and sharing it with friends. Clifton Webb is superb in a role which illustrates what a multifaceted, wonderful actor he was. He has a way of showing brains and wisdom without calling attention to himself. The sort of behaviour one would expect from a consummate intelligence operative. Good script and top-notch acting.Notwithstanding Cinemascope and the war-pic trappings, this is an economical, concise film which tells a gripping tale and goes by fast.

In an effort to trick the Nazi military, British intelligence agents Flight Lt. Charles Cholmondeley and Lt. Commander Ewen Montagu came up with a clever plan: a body, bearing papers indicating that the major Allied attack would come elsewhere, was floated in to Spanish waters. Although technically neutral, Spain was sympathetic to the Nazis, and with any luck the papers would be thought genuine and reach German hands.Although top secret even after the war, a good story is hard to keep down, and after numerous leaks Montagu himself was allowed to write an account of the deception. Titled THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS, the book was an overnight bestseller and the 1956 film version proved very popular as well. In retelling the story on the screen, writer Nigel Balchin took a number of liberties with the story, most particularly in the creation of \"Lucy Sherwood\" (Gloria Graham), a character who exists largely in order to provide a touch of love and pathos; even so, the film is very accurate in terms of the operation itself and how it was carried out.Clifton Webb is perhaps best recalled for his waspish roles in such celebrated films as LAURA, but he sets aside his mannerisms for the role of Montagu and drives the action of the film in a remarkably capable manner, well supported by Robert Flemyng as assistant Lt. George Acres (based on Charles Cholmondeley) and Josephine Griffin as Pam, his secretary. Stephen Boyd does well in the Irish-accented role of Nazi agent Patrick O'Reilly, a semi-fictional character, and Gloria Graham, always a memorable performer, scores heavily in the role of Lucy Sherwood.he film is essentially about process--finding the right body, planting the papers, arranging for the body to be transported, and so on--and as such it moves a fast clip, with director Ronald Neame (an Oscar-winning screenwriter perhaps best now known as director of such films as I COULD GO ON SINGING, THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE, and THE POSEIDON AVENTURE) keeping everything moving at a good clip. The DVD offers excellent picture and sound, as well as the choice between wide screen and full screen. If you know nothing about Operation Mincemeat, you'll find it fascinating stuff--and if you do know about Operation Mincemeat you'll still find the film entertaining on its own.

It was audacious and elaborate but well-coordinated in its scope to stage the death of an important curiour and make sure his body and papers were found by the Germans in a circuitous manner not to draw suspicion. It is difficult to measure how well the plan worked but it did indeed have some impact when the Germans believed the ruse. It seems a difficult kind of story to tell in movie form but this film does it well. A top notch espionage film.",

    "review/text": "The true story of the British attempt to lay some heavy disinformation on the Axis in World War II. Clifton Webb plays Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montagu, the British naval commander who is both mastermind and chief promoter of The Plan, an elaborate concoction of forged papers, misleading faux orders, a convincing back story, and a suitable corpse meant to mislead the enemy about the Allied intentions prior to the invasion of Italy. I don't suppose it's giving too much away to report that things more or less go as planned (although the suspicious Germans do send spy Stephen Boyd in to liven up the last third of the film.) Even though this is indeed a war movie, bang-bang stuff, THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS practically wallows in minute details while eschewing the firefight and the foxhole. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of situational suspense - are those depth charges going to sink the sub and scuttle the movie? - but detail is much preferred over violent action.Along with the likes of Monty Woolley, Webb more or less cornered the market on playing stuffy, condescending Englishmen. Here Webb's strength, a stiff and rather formal persona who needs a baby-sat seven-year-old to evoke his humanity, is put to good use. There are no kids around and Webb doesn't unbend, but this movie doesn't care that much about the personal life of its characters, anyway, save for poor Gloria Grahame, who's given the rather thankless task of shedding some plot-directed tears and seems rather out of place for her troubles.Even though it's clinical and relatively bloodless - in every sense of the word - THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS is a great deal of fun. Director Ronald Neame lovingly dwells on every step of the preparation, through to the execution of the caper, and has us deeply involved when the whole thing is threatened with the appearance of the Boyd character. THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS is a fine, thoughtful film that should appeal to those who aren't necessarily great fans of action war movies.",

    "review/summary": "Good plot, but not enough suspense",
    "review/text": "The Man Who Never Was creates a solid war movie that is better known for the plot, but not for the suspense. The plot is billiant...plant fake invasion plans on corpse, and hope the Germans fall for the bait.Unfortunately, good plot movies end up &quot;connect the dot&quot; themes unless there is real suspense. Everthing goes pretty much according to plan and we don't have the &quot;Dial M For Murder&quot; or the &quot;39 Steps&quot; type of intrigue. For example, the British pretty much rubber stamp this project, despite the severity of the plan. Yes, there is discussion of the plan, but one could be arguing for more orders of ballpoint pens versus inkwell pens. Then, the villain, the one who is supposed to check out the story, pretty much covers a routine checklist that any failed detective would follow. It is not clear why he would go to extremes of sacrificing his life to determine the validity of the plot. There is little character development. Surely, there would have been better ways to obtain the truth, especially once he gets most of the clues. For example, the non-membership of the deceased at the club...following Lucy to see if she goes to any memorial services, etc. The villain would thus be hidden and not expose his identity.Still, one should not be too harsh. The plot is based on a true story and this itself gives admiration to the wartime effort of the British to beat the Germans. One can only imagine the courage of the Bristish soldier( played by Clifton Webb) in a formalized structure of the British hierarchy to not only propose this plot but to execute it. But that is why we are really ready to dodge some bullets and swing at the curve balls.I think then we would have gotten a better flavor of the team work needed to make this plot work. Then this would have been a great movie rather just a good one.",

    "review/text": "As the North African campaign of WWII drew to a close it became obvious that the Allies next move would be to invade Sicily. A deception was therefore needed to try to lure away some of the German defences. Inter-services \"XX Committee\" (XX for double-cross) members Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu, and Squadron Leader Sir Archibald Cholmondley hatched the then unheard of plan of planting a body in the sea off Spain where prevailing currents would surely carry it inshore to the Huelva region, known to be the territory of one of the Nazis' best Spanish agents. The body, dressed as a major in the Royal Marines and apparently killed in a plane crash at sea, would be carrying supposedly top secret documents aimed at convincing any reader that the invasion target was not Sicily at all, but Greece. Montagu himself plays a cameo role in the film as an Air Marshall.The film takes us through the planning and execution of what its creators hoped would become one of the most successful and unusual deceptions in the history of warfare. The leading role of Montagu is played by Clifton Webb, utterly credible as a British naval officer, while Robert Flemyng, who had himself served conspicuously in WWII and who was awarded the Military Cross and Order of The British Empire, takes on the role of Montagu's junior assistant, a composite role based partly on Cholmondley's real-life character. Together they must procure a body that will pass a medical examination to determine the cause of death and they must also create a personality and a past life and history for this man.This is a true-story that avoids battle scenes and big bangs. There are no special effects. It describes a war of stealth and cunning and the cat and mouse game of espionage. It is an atmospheric suspense thriller with Stephen Boyd effective as the determined Axis agent, Patrick O'Reilly, sent in from Ireland to verify the existence and past life of this man who never was. While the soundtrack is one of Alan Rawsthorne's (The Cruel Sea) better scores, it is nevertheless immediately recognizable as one of his compositions, unfortunately sounding so much like all his others. It is ably directed by the great and sometimes under-rated Ronald Neame. It is beautifully filmed, as are all of former-cameraman Neame's pictures. The voice of Churchill is provided by the young Peter Sellers who, at that time in 1956, was establishing his versatility and making a name for himself in the BBC radio comedy, \"The Goon Show\".20th Century Fox's DVD video and sound quality are excellent, as would be expected in the studio release of one of their own productions. A worthy and entertaining addition to any WWII film collection and if it gives you an appetite for a more in-depth recounting of the true story, Ewen Montagu's 1953 book is still available in both the hardback and paperback editions.",

    "review/text": "In the Fifties Britain produced a number of well made WWII movies that recaptured the valor and victories of British arms. The war was past and the civilian deprivations that had lasted well after the war were going away. It was time to celebrate what Britain had accomplished. The Man Who Never Was is among these movies. It tells the true story of Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montague (Clifton Webb), a barrister who now is in Naval Intelligence, who has been charged to come up with a scheme that will convince the Germans that the Allies will not mount a major effort to invade Sicily. His solution is named Operation Mincemeat, and involves using a body as a decoy. I won't go into the details because the fun is in seeing just how Montague and his small staff, an aide and a secretary, go about it. But having accomplished their assignment, they are faced with the likelihood that the Germans will try hard to verify what they are being led to believe. The second half of the movie is a tight little drama where Montague has to outwit an Irishman who has become a German agent.Webb is quite effective playing Montague. There's almost none of the prissiness he brought to most of his roles. He's quiet, determined and smarter than many around him. He has a sharp tongue but seldom shows impatience. It's a nice job. Gloria Grahame plays a young woman who provides an important piece of evidence establishing the body's history, and then unknowingly faces the Irish agent.In my view, this is a very watchable film that keeps moving at a good pace. Ronald Neame was an experienced, effective director who knew what he was doing. Two of his best films and well worth watching are The Horse's Mouth and Tunes of Glory.And for those who appreciate a stiff upper lip and immaculate British manners, here are some of those Fifties WWII movies to track down: The Colditz Story, Ice Cold in Alex, The Battle of the River Platte, Ill Met by Moonlight, I Was Monty's Double, Above Us the Waves, The Cruel Sea. I like them all.There are no extras to speak of. The DVD picture looks very good",

    "review/text": "This is one of the most meticulously well told espionage stories ever!Clifton Webb gives a stunning performance as the cold Lt. Commander Mantagu, whose mission is to create a diversion tactic to lure the Germans away from the real Italian location the British plan to invade. So he thinks of the most daring, sophisticated and simple plan of them all: to have a dead British officer carrying top secret information falling on the hands of the Germans. But the plan is not easy and every detail must be calculated with care as the Germans will know the information is too good, therefore, they will investigate the dead man's life in order to spot any fabrication.Most of the film revolves around the making of the \"the man\" - getting the right body, producing the documents, finding him a personal life, preserving him from decomposing... and launching him from a submarine into a beach in Spain where the sharpest German operator is certain to find him.Then it all becomes a psychological game as the British try to understand what response will come from the Germans. Did they buy it? Did they disregard him as an obvious lie? So the Germans send a top spy into Britain to investigate the life of such a valuable man - too valuable to be true.So this is NOT a spy film like most. It has no fight or combat scenes and most of the action is pretty much likeThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold- both films even share the same cinematographer. Put on top of it all the fact that this is a British film and you'll get all the elegance, pace and charm of the best WWII films.Also impressive is that this is a CinemaScope film made in 1955 with a gorgeous cinematography by Oswald Morris (Lolita,The Guns of Navarone,The Odessa FileandThe Man Who Would Be King).The DVD comes with two versions of the film (one on each side of the disc): the CinemaScope version and the unacceptable Pan&Scan; version that completely destroys the CinemaScope's beautiful frame composition.I admit that after having seen Clifton Webb on other films likeLauraandCheaper By the Dozen, I was afraid he would not look convincing as an Intelligence officer... but Clifton Webb was really an amazing actor and his portrayal of Lt. Montagu is stunningly precise.Recommended.",

The Germans were not fools, and they sent an Irish agent to check out the corpse story. That was where it got really exciting. For its age and subject matter, the movie was quite impressive.

    "review/text": "Although the film was a ostensibly a 20th Century Fox production, THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS was filmed in England using primarily English crew and cast (though American leads). It belongs to a tradition of English war films in which aspects of the war are treated slowly, deliberately, and with great precision. While in the US war films tended to feature John Wayne leading Marines into combat, the British tended to focus much more on the preparation and plans of operations. For instance, the very fine film THE DAM BUSTERS features very little in the way of actual combat. And THE MAN WHO NEVER WAY has no combat whatsoever.The movie is based on a book by the same name about Operation Mincemeat, in which the British attempted to mislead the Germans about the intended invasion spot for D-Day by planting a corpse with fake papers on a beach in Spain, knowing that the Spanish would pass the papers onto the Germans. The entire movie is involved with the formation of the plan, and then creating the man who never was, creating his papers and personal effects. On one level, not much happens in the film, but on another it is one of the most fascinating films ever made about the war, because of the practical problems they deal with in the executing of the operation. Knowing that it was all based upon real events greatly adds to the appeal of the film.Clifton Webb, who was in fact far too old for the part, turns in a convincing performance as Lieutenant Commander Montagu. In most of his films he comes across as arrogant, but in this one he instead communicates competence and intelligence. Gloria Grahame is excellent as the primary female presence in the film. If you look carefully, you can spot Stephen Boyd in a small role, a few years before he would portray Messala in BEH-HUR.",

    "review/summary": "Fine account of elaborate wartime hoax... Good DVD from Fox",
    "review/text": "This is a fine movie of wartime espionage, disinformation and deception. Based on the book by Lt. Cmdr. Ewen Montagu, it tells of British Naval Intelligence's attempt to deceive the Germans about the planned 1943 invasion of Sicily. Trying to draw as many German troops away from Sicily as possible, they concocted a plan to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain, with papers purportedly from Allied High Command indicating that the invasion would go by way of Greece or Sardinia instead of Sicily. The subterfuge succeeded. The Germans embarked on a massive build up of defences around Sardinia and the Greek Peloponnesus, thinning out their defences on Sicily. The hoax affected not only the Sicilian offensive but had effects across the entire European theater. Hitler swallowed it whole. Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was sent to personally supervise the defence of Greece. The 1st Panzer Division was withdrawn from France. Two other Panzer divisions were withdrawn from the Russian front just when they were needed at the crucial Battle of Kursk. Operation Mincemeat, as it was called, was one of the most ingenious and successful hoaxes perpertrated by the Allies during the Second World War.This is a war movie with little battlefront action. It concentrates on the quiet background work of the Intelligence Service. The first half of the movie deals with the hatching of the plan, the procurement of the dead body, the faking of the dead man's history and the drawing up of his elaborate cover story. The fictional officer is christened \"Major William Martin\" of The Royal Marines. The second half starts when the Germans fall for the ruse and send a spy over to England to check out its veracity. There follows a cat and mouse game as the British try to tie up loose ends and fill in the fake history they have put together for the dead man, including his purported girlfriend. The movie is always absorbing, often rivetingly so. It is one of the few WW2 espionage films that have stood the test of time. The fact that it was a true story makes it doubly interesting.Fox have released a barebones edition of the film on DVD. It contains both the widescreen version in its original 2.55:1 Cinemascope (enhanced for widescreen TV) and a fullscreen pan-&-scan version. The widescreen version strangely is placed on the unmarked flipside of the double-sided DVD. Picture quality is fine, very good in fact if you consider this film dates from 1955. There is very little dirt, speckling or any print damage. Colors are strong and bright. Skintones look natural. Black levels are well rendered. The pan-&-scan version version looks terrible in comparison, with a claustrophobic, darker image, heavier grain and a softer picture overall. Sound is available in the original English 2.0 mono, a 4.0 Surround remix as well as alternate Spanish and French 2.0 mono tracks. A single theatrical trailer is all that's included. A fine memento of wartime subterfuge and deception with solid acting and direction from a time when there was still a viable British Film Industry.Note: The grave at Huelva, on the southern coast of Spain still bears the name \"Major William Martin\". The real identity of the dead man was kept secret for over 50 years. It was only in 1996 that he was finally identified as a homeless alcoholic Welshman. Today, across the bottom of the white marble tombstone is an added epitaph, finally revealing his identity, \"Glyndwr Michael served as Major William Martin\".",

Anyhow, \"The Man Who Never Was\" describes the true events of the British trying to confuse the Germans as to where the Allies will invade - Sicily or Greece. By arranging to have a dead body wash ashore in Spain with top-secret documents, the British cause the Germans to alter their defenses, thus saving the Allies from suffering even more casualties. How the British found a body, the details that they had to come up with to make the Germans believe the body was for real, and the subsequent German effort to determine whether or not the information found on the body was accurate, all make for an exciting story which moves at a swift pace. This is really a great World War II movie.",

    "review/text": "My son asked me to purchase some WWII DVD's for him this past Christmas. Sadly, I wasn't able to include the best NAVAL WWII movies which were made by the British. Two of the best of them were The Man Who Never Was and Sink The Bismark. Sadly neither of these titles are available on DVD. Both are better than just about any of the American WWII movies (yes, I'm an American). Both of these movies are based on TRUE stories (Unlike Disney's latest Pearl Harbor movie!!), only the minor characters are fictional. If you ever see the Man who Never Was you will never forget it. The story is about a true scheme which the Brits used to make the Germans believe the southern European landings were going to be in a different location than the real one. They discuss how to do this and come up with the idea of obtaining a body of a young man, which they are going to dress up as an officer with invasion plans for another location than the one intended. The movie spends a lot of time explaining how they got the body, what they had to do to fake all this, including figuring out on which European beach they should have the body wash ashore. Unlike most American movies, you really get an excellent view of what it's really like to plan CIA type operations. Wonderful movie. You will love all the characters, even the villains!! Lots of naval action from the highest to the lowest commands. Buy it.---UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD YET!!!----Neither is &quot;Sink the Bismark&quot;, which I remember seeing in college back in the early '60's. I remember it vividly because the auditorium in which it was shown allowed the audience to &quot;attack and sink&quot; the Bismark using paper airplanes!! This movie is also terrific. It too is VERY British. It too explains why the British Navy was so awesome in WWII. It also has great actors in great roles. Super movie. Both of these movies are the best in WWII movies. Now if I could just remember the name of the British naval movie which tells the story of the naval war off the coast of South America!! Yet another wonderful British Naval movie!!The Man Who Never Was has scenes which should bring tears to your eyes, if you are the least bit sensitive!! Good movie to get your gal into crying on your shoulder!! (And that actually happened as well ;-)",

Webb's performance is both intelligent and touching, while Stephen Boyd as the German agent sent to investigate the situation,exudes just the right amount of charm and malevolence. Gloria Graham is probably the only downside to this highly effective film,but the others well and truly make up for her somewhat overcooked effort.

    "review/text": "The body of a dead British officer washes ashore on a Spanish beach; he has on him documents alluding to British forces landing in Greece. Before the Nazis rush from Sicily (where the Brits actually will land) to Greece, they send an agent to London to determine if the intelligence is genuine. That's the intrigue in this intriguing docudrama financed by Hollywood (thus the miscasting of Clifton Webb and Gloria Grahame) but made by English director Ronald Neame on real locations using English actors.Cast against type, Webb is suitably correct. Grahame, an Oscar winner for \"The Bad and the Beautiful,\" however, is embarrassing in a key but contrived role as a librarian whose flyer lover is killed. As the Nazi agent snooping around London, the handsome Stephen Boyd dominates the last quarter of the film with steely charm, reminding us again what a loss his early death was to films in the 1950s. And it's nice to see Sir Cyrl Cusack and Joan Hickson (later Miss Marple on television) in bit parts.What's not so nice (in the version I saw) is the shameful DVD transfer, which begins and ends in the original Cinemascope but throughout reformats to full screen, diminishing the reach of the actual locations and the re-creation of wartime London. This true story, especially the invention of a non-person's whole life, ranks with John LeCarre's tales and \"Five Fingers\" (still unreleased on DVD) as one of Hollywood's better espionage films. \"The Man Who Never Was,\" considering what he achieved, deserved more respect.",

Patton being in charge of a fake army to the use of double agents. The allies were able to keep vital German panzer tanks and troops away from the Normandy beaches as Hitler kept his attention on the Calais region.Yet even before this British intelligence scored another coup by diverting German attention away from the imminent invasion of Sicily by making the Germans believe that Greece and perhaps Sardinia were the actual targets.They did this by creating the man who never was. Taking the body of a man whose condition could be interpreted as having died from drowning, dressing him in clothes with accompanying documentation and casting him off from a submarine just off the coast of Spain. All with the goal that the body and the vital top secrets it carried being intercepted by the Nazi's.It was an inspired scheme and this movie, in much the same vein as the similar true-life deception movie I WAS MONTY'S DOUBLE really shines.

    "review/text": "This film would have been much more famous if Hitchcock had directed it. Ronald Neame does and excellent job. A true story of the Second World War with great locations (another good chance to get a look at the Spain of those times). But the fact that it is a true historical story makes it interesting enough.Besides, there's Gloria Graham doing an amazingly wonderful performance. It just amazed me how well she was in this role.This is the second film by Neame that I watch (after Tunes of Glory, which is even better) and both are wonderful movies.Typical, I would say, of the good-natured, common-man, and respectul films the British used to do before the Beatles generation. A bygone era of which this film reminds me with melancholy.The only thing that lessens a bit the value of \"The Man Who never Was\", in my opinion, is the other female character, who does not do such an excellent job as the rest of the cast.",

    "review/text": "I liked this movie very much. It went into great but not overwhelming detail about the British Naval Intelligence Service during WWII. The detail the British went through to confuse the Germans was phenominal and was very adequately portrayed in the movie. David Niven playing the lead did a good job of portraying the methodical British Naval officer in charge of the detail. Another great British Naval movie had two names. The first one was &quot;The Persuit Of The Graf Spee&quot; and then released as &quot;The Battle Of The River Plate&quot;. It was filmed in great color and was about the battle off South America between the German pocket battleship Graf Spee and 3 cruisers, two British and one New Zealand: The Ajax, Exeter and Achilles. The Graf Spee was portrayd by the US Navy's heavy cruiser USS Salem and because of the difference in US and British ship construction the look of the Graf Spee was very different from the British ships and therefore much more believable. This movie has been out of print for some time and as of two years ago there were no plans to make it available",

Clifton Webb and the glorious Gloria Graham (in a bit part) couldn't save this belatedly patriotic and badly produced, low-budget film. (It was made in 1955). No wonder its out of print.",

    "review/text": "This collection is something of a grab-bag, encompassing as it does both the old and the new and both concert film and biographical documentary. All in all, however, it's a phenomenal value: four fine films retailing for the price of a single DVD. The rock legends that they profile hail from four different countries: Rolling Stones from England, Neil Young from Canada, Bob Dylan from America, and U2 from Ireland. They're captured at very different times in their careers: the Stones and Young in their late periods, Dylan very early on, and U2 at a midpoint. The Amazon description is not accurate when it states there are only four discs in this box (\"No Direction Home\" is actually a two-DVD set) and when it indicates that there are no extras. In fact, there are quite a few.\"Shine a Light\" (122 minutes), directed by Martin Scorsese, presents a 2006 performance by the Stones at New York's Beacon Theatre, incorporating archival footage from the band's long tenure. Jack White, Buddy Guy, and Christina Aguilera join Mick, Keith, Ron, and Charlie for individual songs, and bonuses include backstage and rehearsal footage as well as four performances cut from the film: \"Undercover of the Night,\" \"Paint It Black,\" \"Little T&A;,\" and \"I'm Free.\"\"Neil Young: Heart of Gold\" (103 minutes) was directed by Jonathan Demme. It documents a 2005 concert by Young at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, during which he premieres the songs from his album \"Prairie Wind\" and, in an encore set, performs music from his back catalog. Emmylou Harris joins Neil on two duets. There are two bonus songs: \"He Was the King\" from \"Prairie Wind\" and \"The Needle and the Damage Done\" from a 1971 TV performance on \"The Johnny Cash Show.\"\"No Direction Home\" (208 minutes), originally an \"American Masters\" special on PBS, is another Scorsese film, but this one is mainly a bio-doc with brief clips of Dylan performances. It covers the period from his arrival in New York as a folk singer in 1961 to his temporary retirement as a rock singer after a motorcycle accident in 1966. Extras include performances of \"Blowing in the Wind,\" \"Girl of the North Country,\" \"Man of Constant Sorrow,\" \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" Love Minus Zero / No Limit,\" and \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" in addtion to an unused promo for \"Positively 4th Street.\"\"Rattle and Hum\" (98 minutes), directed by Phil Joanou, contains live concert footage from Denver's McNichols Sports Arena and other US venues as well as in the studio. It depicts U2 on their 1987 Joshua Tree tour, fusing American blues, folk, and gospel music with their signature sound. They're joined by Bob Dylan and B.B. King, among others, as well as a New York gospel choir that performs \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.\" This black-and-white and color film was the companion to U2's sixth album release.

    "review/text": "Let me just start by saying I picked this product up at walmart for 13 bucks and I couldnt be happier,Each one of this films is worth the price of purchase and this is a true bargin for a lover of music.Shine A Light- This is a wonderful snapshot provivded by the great martin scorcese of the rolling stones in there twillight years and showing that they are still capable as they were 40 years previous in delivering a wonderful performance to a crowded hall,The thing that makes this a more worthy purchase than others is the setlist which includes great rarely heard album cuts and being able to watch the stones work a good venue instead of lost in a see of hundres of thousands watching video monitors,It truly is a great performance and a wonderful collection for any stones fan.No Direction Home - Marty Scorcese is back up to bat is this awesome 3 hour saga of dylans early years from woody guthrie wannabe to folk god to outcast and recluse from 1961-1966, It has wonderful interviews and performances that will have any music fan glued to there seats with all the early hits from \"blowin in the wind\" to \"like a rolling stone\" and everything in between. This is the story of how Robert Zimmerman became Bob Dylan and what a great tale it is.Rattle and Hum- This is U2 in their prime before they got wrapped up in fame and politics,this is U2 still hungry and out to prove themselves,while at the same time paying tribute to their heroes The beatles,Bob dylan,Jimi hendrix,BB king and Elvis presley.Amazing performaces of tracks like \"Pride (in the name of love)\" and \"sunday bloody sunday\" are bound to move emotion out of even the most hardened human being or U2 hater.Heart of Gold- Neil Young's storytelling and musical prowess are on display with this 2005 performace that is meant to show off his newest album (at the time)\"Praire Wind\" which takes over te first half of the show,it drags on a little long,but manages to show Young still has some chops,Then comes The harvest heavy second portion of the show with great performaces of songs like \"heart of gold\" \"old man\" \"needle and the damage done\" which make up for any mild short comings that the first half had and overall make for a very enjoyable experince with Neil at the Ryman auditorium.In conclusion There really is something for any true music lover to enjoy here and like I said every one of these dvds is worth the price you're paying for all 4,So it really is a win win. I whole heartedly reccomend it.",

    "review/text": "Before Roxy's recent reformation, this was the most complete concert available for the band. The band was supporting their most successful album \"Avalon\". While many of the performances are memorable, the band's sound had become quite slick at this point incorporating more disco type beats. Without the powerhouse drumming of Paul Thompson (Andy Newmark is a great drummer and more diverse but he lacks Paul's thumping sound)the songs are more lanquid, loose and relaxed. If you're a fan of the band's last trio of albums (\"Manifesto\", \"Flesh + Blood\" and \"Avalon\")this is the perfect chill out album full of sweet melodies and love songs.I'm a long time Roxy Music fan and prefer their latest concert video \"Live at the Apollo\" because it captures much of their fire evident in their concerts prior to 1976. With original drummer Paul Thompson back firmly in the rhythm chair, it's a superior performance all around. The only people missing are Eno (who was invited but didn't want to participate)and Eddie Jobson (keyboards and electric violin). Covering their entire history, \"Apollo\" gives the listener a better sense of what this groundbreaking band was all about. Also, the video direction is better for \"Apollo\".\"The High Road\" is still a great document of the end of the line for Roxy Music. I had this on video and laserdisc and purchased it on DVD simply because I'm a die hard fan. The song selection for both is extremely good and Roxy fans will be pleased to have documents from both parts of the band's career. Your preference will probably be dictated by what stage you got into Roxy Music (i.e., \"Avalon\" vs. \"Country Life\" or even \"For Your Pleasure\").",

Logan see's his whole family get killed in front of his eyes when he was a little boy, he then goes to live with his uncle Jake who brings him up and teaches him martial arts, as Logan matures into manhood, he prepares himself to go back and avenge his family's death. Long Memory... Short Fuse!",

    "review/text": "With his days of theatrical releases behind him, Chuck Norris' career revolved almost exclusively aroundWalker, Texas Ranger. His extracurricular output (i.e. DTV movies) seemed to consist mainly of favors to his sons and brother, but at least those were still technically Chuck Norris vehicles, unlike this one. \"Logan's War\" is a film with an identity crisis, wanting to be an action/revenge/mafia thriller on one hand and a quasi-inspirational drama on the other...but without Chuck Norris in the lead. I'm not a diehard fan of the man, but even I can tell that this would've been a better movie if the man featured most prominent only the DVD cover was also the man most featured in the movie.The story: after his family is murdered in a mob hit, Logan Fallon (Eddie Cibrian,Third Watch,Invasion) is brought up by his uncle Jake (Norris) to be a soldier and a man of honor. However, upon returning home as a military hero, he pursues his lifelong ambition to seek vengeance on the man who made him an orphan (R.D. CallYoung Guns II)...Not unlike his role inSidekicks, Norris plays the role of mentor to his fiery young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, whom this film really is about. Norris is consistently present for the first half of the movie, and then practically disappears until the very end. The false advertising of this one's cover - highlighting Norris' visage and billing him over Eddie Cibrian - is pretty disappointing: Cibrian is a decent leading man, but even at this point in his career, Norris would have been more exciting to watch. The mixed morality of the tale (i.e. Logan is raised to be a good man but can't be separated from his anger) is surprisingly mature and less black & white than most movie fare tends to be, but it contrasts inharmoniously to the motivational themes of unconventional families and military glory: scenes in which Logan rescues an officer under fire and befriends an abused boy, his mother, and their dog almost feel like they're from a different film than the ones in which he schemes his way into the mob and beats up various enforcers. There's also a part thrown in about Logan being psychic, but it's an unnecessary addition and could've easily been left out of the movie.There's not a lot of action in \"Logan's War\", I'm disappointed to say. A couple shootouts and three mostly short hand-to-hand fights comprise the adrenaline centerpieces. Cibrian is surprisingly adept with his spinning kicks and sweeps, but just when you're starting to appreciate this guy's athletic ability during an encounter, the fight ends. Norris gets the coolest move of the movie by copying the flying kick through a car windshield of his ownGood Guys Wear Black, but a couple acrobatic takedowns by his character are clearly performed via stunt doubles. Slow motion is excruciatingly overused. The film's production is clean but clearly of made-for-TV quality, what with the aforementioned red filters, slow motion, and the opening credits stretching throughout the first fifteen minutes of the movie. The acting is passable, but no single character is all that interesting.There's nothing very wrong with \"Logan's War\", but it's just not intriguing enough to get a higher rating. Norris fans can do better, and they would probably be the only ones who'd be interested in this movie in the first place. Keep looking.",

For the real unrated version, you have to track down a European disk (which likely gives a duration several minutes longer than the US 121 minutes). A few minutes might not seem like a significant difference, but this film really is a pulp masterpiece and excising its more provocative moments attacks the very heart of what makes it a pulp masterpiece. Is there a responsible company out there that can rescue this film?",

    "review/text": "Being a huge Barry Gifford fan, having enjoyed De La Iglesia's Day of the Beast, and of the opinion that Wild at Heart was one of the best novel to film adaptations in the history of cinema, needless to say, my expectations for this movie were very high. I couldnt have imagined it being so satisfying.De La Iglesia's adaptation of Perdita Durango takes its liberties but (like Wild At Heart) finds its inspiration in the original source material without destroying the spirit.Romeo and Perdita carve thier way through the world with violence, magic, and sex. They are sadistic, perverse, and perfect for each other. From thier first fateful meeting, it is a dark destiny, a collision of two black souls. If the movie has any message, it is that even the most wicked person has a diabolic soulmate. Love does not discriminate.The preformances are great. Javier Bardem as Romeo was totally unrecognizable as the same guy who played the stud in Jamon, Jamon. He plays Romeo as charming, self preserving, and almost noble killer because his beliefs are in darkness, sacrifice, revenge, and amoral spirituality. My fears of Rosie Perez, an actress I am not fond of in any way, were unfounded as she embodied Perdita perfectly with sadism and sizzle. James Gandolfini, as the Wile E Coyote like DEA agent Dumas, was also very good, perpetually abused and doggedly determined.De La Iglesia handles with the film great skill. The pacing is fast and furious. Every scene is alive with energy, and his compostion is masterful. He has vastly improved from the flawed, yet entertaining, Day of the Beast, and demonstrates that his is a talent that continues to grow. Given the proper material and time, I can see him providing a enjoyable body of manic, surreal, and outrageous work.",

His other two flims (Accion Mutante and The Day of the Beast) have been hits all over the world except in the U.S. He has won many awards at film festivals worldwide. The acting in the film is top notch. Pacing is relentless and some of the action sequences are breathtaking. So once again don't be fooled by bad american marketing. This film gives any Tarantino or Rodriguez flick a run for its money. The Europeans know how to make action and horror.

Casting against type is Rosie Perez as the title character, Perdita, who is as wild and crazy as Romeo. Along the way they kidnap a couple of white bread kids and stay ahead of the law, represented by a pre-Sopranos James Gandolfini in a hilarious turn as really unlucky lawman who keeps getting run over by speeding vehicles, and Repo Man director, Alex Cox as his dimwitted partner.This is funny, violent, warped cult film oddity that features an awesome cast (also including Screamin' Jay Hawkins) and an equally impressive soundtrack (with not one but two rockin' tunes by Southern Culture on the Skids). Think of this as Natural Born Killers without all the political stuff or Wild at Heart on bad acid.Certainly not a film for everyone but if you like your action movies fast 'n' furious with a good dose of weirdness on top, then check this bad boy out.",

Together they take it to the road to finally pick up a young couple. Their purpose is it, to sacrifice them to this weird gods or whatever Romeo believes in. But the ceremony is interrupted. Bad luck for Romeo and Perdita. With the couple in the back they start their way to Las Vegas, where Romeo has got some deals. But as those kind of roadmovies are, everything goes wrong. That's quite it with the story!!! however there are these few sequences in this movie that are just of sheer brilliance like these weird flashbacks, shortly-cut scenes that are being seen as Romeo or Perdita are telling stories of their past or so. Pretty sick though is the rough violence, shown in the movie!! But in this film it's simply a neccessity!! well, that's it so far!!! If you like Tarantino or Lynch, or you are even into splatter, go and watch it; if you've got the nerves, it's great fun!!bye, bye martin",

That is a lot of information crammed onto each disk and frankly, I wasn't expecting much in the way of quality. However, I was delightfully surprise. The quality was quite nice, and far exceeded my expectations.",

At five films per disk, you can imagine that the quality is pretty poor. The films are pixilated and are only worth watching on a smaller screen. Still, I picked it up for $5 and watched while I was on a sick day and it was fine for that. Not a bad selection: \"The Station Agent\" with Peter Dinklage, \"Comedian\" with Jerry Seinfeld and the late Greg Giraldo. \"Get Bruce\" is a fun documentary about comedy writer Bruce Vilanch. All in all, okay viewing copies. Just don't spend much more than $5. Bare bones DVD's with NO extras.",

    "review/text": "FLYING DAGGER (1993) came out at a time when \"wire fu\" costume fantasies (in which the actors, hoisted on wires, fly back and forth during their swordplay/kung fu battles) were flooding the Hong Kong market (SWORDSMAN II, BUTTERFLY AND SWORD, KUNG FU CULT MASTER, DRAGON INN, etc.). It wasn't the first comedy in the genre, but it remains, arguably, the funniest of them, easily surpassing HANDSOME SIBLINGS and ROYAL TRAMP I &amp; II. Boasting enough fighting &amp; flying thrills to engage the action crowd, it's a typical HK melange of comedy, romance, fantasy, acrobatics, and swordplay, yet is very well put together and utterly delightful from start to finish.It tells the story of a race by opposing teams of bounty hunters, Big Dagger and Little Dagger, and their female rivals, Big and Little Bewitchment, to track down wanted criminal Nine-Tails Fox and his wife, Flying Cat. Eventually the two teams join forces to bring the criminals to justice, only to find out that the wanted parties were framed by Master Lui who had initially hired Big and Little Dagger to pursue Fox. This all leads to a big battle at the end with seven good guys fighting Master Lui and his two super-powerful henchmen. In the course of it all, the male and female bounty hunters pair off romantically.Hong Kong comedies are often hit-and-miss when it comes to actual laugh content, but this one is full of clever and inventive gags throughout. Some of the best gags involve the disembodied hand of \"Never Die,\" one of the villains the heroes encounter. After being chopped off, the hand lives on and chases the heroes, often grabbing them in spots they don't want grabbed, but eventually it becomes their ally and helps them out of rough spots. Think of ADDAMS FAMILY'S Thing as an action hero and you'll get the idea. And the trick effects are easily as seamless as those of the ADDAMS FAMILY.The good-looking cast is full of top Hong Kong names, most notably Jacky Cheung (A BULLET IN THE HEAD) as Nine-Tails Fox and Maggie Cheung (IRMA VEP, IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE) as Flying Cat. This is easily one of Maggie's best action roles and ranks alongside her work in DRAGON INN. Tony Leung (also in DRAGON INN) and Sharla Cheung Man (ROYAL TRAMP) play the older bounty hunters who pair off, while the exceedingly cute \"little\" partners are played by Gloria Yip and Jimmy Lin, who bring to the film an attractive dose of youthful charm.",

    "review/summary": "Undoubtedly the funniest kung-fu film I've ever seen!",
    "review/text": "I would not hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who can overlook ridiculous plotting and laughable situations to concentrate on the main strength of this film, the incredible amount of FUN involved.I've watched this film so many times and every time it just makes me crack up. I mean, where else would you get a film that has shades of \"Evil Dead II\" with its dismembered hand running about attacking people and a decapitated invincible kung-fu master walking around bumping into things after losing his head, next to scenes of laughable comedy such as the character \"Nine Tails Fox\" who, armed with a long fluffy tail connected to his backside, can defeat enemies with his special move known as the \"Fox Farts\". You can guess the rest and believe me silly does not even begin to cover it.The plot follows the exploits of two brothers who are bounty hunters on the trail of a master criminal for a substantial reward. The only problem is that they are not the only ones after the reward. Two female witches make the inept bounty hunters lives a misery before they realise that the only way to catch the villain is to work together. Various bizarre and surreal sub plots twist their way around the main storyline, making the film a little hard to follow in places, with people turning up out of the blue only serving to complicate matters even further. But overall you cannot criticise the scriptwriters for coming up with something totally original and unpredictable.The name \"Flying Dagger\" is appropriate as the over the top wirework has the characters spend more time in the air than they do on the ground. These fight scenes are very well done if you like your fighting hyper kinetic with super speed editing and characters literally flying all over the place with amazing speed. It all makes for a wonderful spectacle. Blood flows freely in a totally over the top comic book fashion so it is hard to take it seriously. The film couldn't be classed as gory as it always seems to be well balanced with the comedy scenes so the film never gets too dark. Serious martial arts film purists may be put off by the light hearted tone of the picture, but if you're after a film that is fast, fun, hugely entertaining and completely surreal, you can't really go wrong with \"Flying Dagger\".",

The four hour program, based on Deborah Cadbury's well researched \"Space Race: The Epic Battle Between America and the Soviet Union for Dominion of Space\", is very well done. It depicts the simultaneous efforts of the Russian/USSR Chief Designer, Sergei Pavlovich Korolev and the German/USA Rocket Scientist, Werner Von Braun, to send a man to the moon and bring him back safely.Information about Korolev is so hard to find in the USA that I'd think this video would be welcomed here and readily available. Not so.This DVD has been available since 2006 in the UK/PAL but not in the US/NTSC. Why is that? Do we need to depend on YouTube for everything? From what I've seen of it there, this is a top notch production. You can visit the National Geographic website for more information about the program. I emailed National Geographic as to product availability. They say it's not available. Why not?BTW, I recommend James Harford's thoroughly researched \"Korolev: How One Man Masterminded the Soviet Drive to Beat America to the Moon\" highly.",

    "review/text": "This book is on the making of the three great 20th. Century Fox World War II Epics: \"The Longest Day,\" \"Patton\" and \"Tora Tora Tora.\" This book is authored by the creators and publishers of the great \"Cinema Retro\" magazine, a magazine devoted to the films of the 1960s and '70s. I am not reviewing the DVDs which I already owned prior to purchasing the book.\"The Longest Day\" is my all-time favorite film other than the James Bond films. For years I have thirsted for a book on the making of this classic film. And while only of a third of this book is devoted to that film, that is enough. This book is devoted to the making of the films with numerous color and black and white photos, other photos of lobby cards and posters from around the world, and pictures of various memorabilia from each film. My favorite part is the section on scenes that were cut out. For instance, there is a scene of a bloody Rod Steiger in \"The Longest Day.\" Yet he only appears in one brief scene in the film. I have always wondered why only one scene? This answers the question. There is also a scene of Roddy McDowall fighting with another G.I. on the ship taking him to Utah Beach. This is not in the film either. There are sections devoted to deleted scenes in \"Patton\" and \"Tora Tora Tora\" as well. The writers also include their own brief review of each film and the events that occured upon the film's release. I particularly loved a picture of an ad for the reserved-seat showing of \"The Longest Day\" on Broadway in New York. A reserved orchestra seat for an evening performance was $3.00!! (I remember when my parents took me on a trip to Manhattan and playing in a row on reserved seat were \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" the Brando \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" and \"The Longest Day.\" Can you imagine three epics of this caliber playing today? By the way, the unfortunate release of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" the same year is probably the reason \"The Longest Day\" didn't receive the Best Picture Oscar of 1962.)The book also has biographical segments on actors like George C. Scott and Karl Malden in \"Patton.\" You will also learn in detail what Darryl F. Zanuck had to do to get the great John Wayne to appear in \"The Longest Day.\"I absolutely loved this book. I'm only surprised I didn't read it sooner. Highly recommended.",

    "review/text": "Ask your standard movie fan which Alistair MacLean adaptation they prefer and the vote would most likely be split between THE GUNS OF NAVARONE and WHERE EAGLES DARE, but, whilst I absolutely love the latter of those two, my personal favorite has been for many years WHEN EIGHT BELLS TOLL - a spy thriller penned by MacLean in the late 1960s and filmed with Anthony Hopkins in the lead role in 1971.I saw the movie many years ago on British television and always longed to see it once more. My prayers were answered when it was finally announced for DVD release in Region 2. Armed with a new region-free DVD player, I ordered it and anxiously checked my Maryland mailbox every day until its arrival.Watching it once again after all these years my passion for this action adventure is unfailing, I consider this to be the best spy thriller that [Bond producers] EON Productions NEVER made.With a simply superb cast that sees Hopkins joined by Robert Morley (as a rather snobbish boss) and Jack Hawkins (as a suspicious millionaire) this movie is simply brimming over with \"Bondian\" elements that include beautiful girls (bad and good), thrilling action, underwater battles, building suspense and a roaring soundtrack. It's the most entertaining couple of hours of spy thriller action that I have had the opportunity to enjoy in almost two decades.Hopkins plays secret agent Calvert who travels to the coast of Scotland disguised as a marine biologist to investigate the disappearance of bullion ships in the Irish Sea. There he encounters a colorful array of characters, both friend and foe before a climactic battle in an underground boathouse.The Region 2 DVD sports a fine transfer with only the theatrical trailer as a special feature. Still it is very entertaining and well worth putting your hard earned cash for. I simply cannot recommend it strongly enough.",

    "review/text": "This was one of the later film versions of an Alister Maclean novel, and is a tidy little thriller with little time wasted.Anthony Hopkins plays a secret service agent tasked with solving the pirating of millions of pounds of gold bullion in the North Sea. This search takes him to remote locations in the Hebrides, unravelling the secrets of a small town where people and yachts have been disappearing. Being an Alister Maclean novel, nothing and nobody is what they at first appear - the usual ingredients are present and correct - the femme fatale, the damsel in distress, the double crossing, the dour and unstoppable agent... even Maclean's dry sense of humour, which often gets lost in the translation to the big screen, comes through - probably as a result of Maclean writing the screenplay from his novel.The pace of the film is perfect, with a running time of 90 minutes not leaving you feel the film has outstayed its welcome. The actions scenes are fine, if a little outdated.. the scenes skulking around the castle even reminded me of possibly my favourite Maclean movie - Where Eagles Dare (the actor who played the castle Kommandant, General Rosemeyer, is also in this movie, making another link). Music is pretty good for a 70's score, with a brash theme that crops up anytime our hero is running or flying around - which is a significant part of the time.. it's the sort of music which would not have been out of place in an episode of `The Professionals'. Another piece of inter-movie trivia - the stunts for the movie were done by Vic Armstrong and Bob Simmons, both Bond movie veterans. Watching this movie, one can almost imagine Hopkins playing Bond.Hopkins plays the cynical Maclean hero well, with the right does of dry humour - and is ably backed up by a great character actor cast - Robert Morley basically plays a more comic version of `M' from the earlier Bond movies, Jack Hawkins has little screen time as Sir Anthony Skouros, and is even voiced over (by Charles Gray, who also appeared in two Bond movies - `Diamonds are forever' and `You only live twice') as he had a voice box owing to his throat cancer. Nathalie Delon plays the femme fatale role adequately - as far as I can tell, this was one of the few times she appeared in an English speaking role.All in all, a refreshingly taut little thriller which hits the right notes, and has not dated too badly. A cut above other thrillers of its time, recommended for any fans of Maclean or 70's thrillers in general, but not one of his most best movie adaptations.",

    "review/summary": "Anthony Hopkins deals out death in the Scottish Highlands and foils a ruthless plot in this scenic, slightly confusing thriller",
    "review/text": "Even at 34 Anthony Hopkins made an unlikely hero for a rousing adventure thriller such as When Eight Bells Toll, based on the book by Alistair Maclean. Hopkins face looks so young, with even a hint of cherubic baby fat. His height and build are only average. And 36 years later it's hard to erase the knowledge of the future Hannibal Lecter, James Stevens, Henry Wilcox and Titus Andronicus, or for that matter much of the dreck he's been appearing in these last few years.Still, Hopkins carries off the role of Commander Philip Calvert, an agent for British Naval Intelligence, with aplomb. First, Hopkins can act. He's completely assured in a role which sometimes calls for the suspension of belief. His voice is quick and confident. He knows how to underplay. Second, he's physically quick. The role calls for a lot of clambering up and down cliffs, running up staircases and along paths, swimming in a scuba outfit and engaging bad guys in fistfights. There are enough medium shots to see that Hopkins is doing a great deal of the action himself. Third, he's intelligent and gives an intelligent performance.Why is Calvert doing all this stuff? Because gold bullion is being pirated from ships off the coast of Scotland's western highlands. Calvert, tough, disrespectful of authority, as unintimidated by Naval bureaucracy as he is by killers, is sent in undercover to investigate. What he finds, aided by a young Naval helper (and we know the fate that always awaits young helpers), involves Sir Anthony Skouras (Jack Hawkins), a very rich tycoon on a plush yacht anchored in a stormy loch, Charlotte (Nathalie Delon), introduced as Sir Anthony's young wife, and Lord Charnley (Derek Bond), who appears to be Sir Anthony's great and good friend. Occasionally checking in with Calvert is his boss in London, a fat and seemingly complaisant spymaster called Uncle Albert (Robert Morley). When Calvert, suspicions aroused, requests that Sir Anthony be vetted, Uncle Albert is deeply offended. \"He's a member of my club! He's on the wine committee!\" In an amusing plot development, Uncle Albert winds up coming to the loch to find out what's really going on. Since by now Calvert's young sidekick (played by a young Corin Redgrave) is no longer with us, Uncle Albert winds up doing a bit of careful violence. Considering Morley's corpulence and often officious roles he usually played, it was a pleasure witnessing his cautious but ready steadfastness.The search for the gold and for the mastermind takes Philip Calvert through some of Scotland's mistiest, coldest-looking and rockiest sea-swept scenery, from a desolate cemetery and a desperate fight with two goons to deep under water in a scuba outfit and into the bowels of a deliberately sunken ship and another desperate fight, this time with a goon in a diving suit. There's even a flaming helicopter crash into the cold, murky loch waters. Calvert eventually puzzles out the murderous scheme, but not before there are plot twists, turns and roundabouts. Along the way, Calvert deals out death by shooting and knifing, by throwing overboard, by neck cracking, by underwater acetylene torch and even by crossbow. Calvert is not a man to find yourself between him and his objective.When Eight Bells Toll isn't a great adventure thriller, but within its own limits it's entertaining. Those limits are the same as in most of the many other adventure thrillers by Maclean...headlong plots that don't stop for anything, regular intervals of vivid violence and escapes, unexpected betrayals, loose ends that stay loose, a certain level of confusion about what exactly is happening, minimal significant female involvement and no sex. He wrote the screenplay for this one and often worked on the screenplays for the movies made from his books. Think Ice Station Zebra, The Guns of Navarone, Where Eagles Dare and quite a few others. Personally, I still like his first, HMS Ulysses, published in 1955. He cranked out nearly a book a year until he died in 1987. The last 20 or so, in my opinion, were little more than recycled quickies, predictable and uninteresting.The one disquieting and poignant note is watching Jack Hawkins, a first-rate actor, as Sir Anthony Skouras. Hawkins was a beefy man with a distinctive, raspy voice. He smoked 60 cigarettes a day at one time. In 1965 surgeons removed his larynx because of cancer. He no longer could speak. Hawkins continued to act until his death in 1973. Charles Gray, a character actor and friend of Hawkins, usually dubbed his voice. Gray provides Hawkins' voice in When Eight Bells Toll.The Region 2 DVD's picture transfer is easy to watch but nothing special. It seemed to me that the audio could have used some work. There are no significant extras.",

    "review/text": "Alistair Maclean's 1966 thriller \"When Eight Bells Toll\" gets the cinematic treatment in this 1971 British effort, now available on DVD in the UK and US (this particular DVD is the UK version). Maclean did the screenplay, adapting loosely but effectively from his novel. A young Anthony Hopkins is worth watching as a ruthless British agent battling a nasty and ruthless gang of gold bullion thieves in the Scottish Highlands.As the story opens, Naval officer and secret agent Philip Calvert (Hopkins) boards a hijacked ship, only to find his fellow agents murdered on board. Calvert himself barely escapes with his life, after a struggle with one of the bullion thieves. Calvert will find himself on notice with his boss, hunted by the gold thieves, and struggling to make sense of the case. A helicopter flight around the Western Highlands will solidify his suspicions but place him in mortal danger. Calvert's relentless pursuit of the thieves will lead to a dramatic final showdown.The action sequences in this movie are pretty good, the more so for not looking like staged martial arts exhibitions. The underwater scenes, especially one in which a leading character is trapped underwater, are quite effective. The location shooting in Scotland is terrific. Fans of the novel are duly warned that Maclean altered the way some of the leading characters are played between the book and the movie, and the ending plays out a little differently. \"When Eight Bells Toll\" is a decent movie, and practically a 70's period piece; recommended.",

    "review/summary": "a very good adaptation of alistair maclean's maritime thriller...",
    "review/text": "Scottish author Alistair MacLean (1922-87) specialized in tales of adventure and suspense, and with MacLean himself responsible for the screenplay, When Eight Bells Toll (1971) is one of the better screen adaptations of his books. The movie does a nice job of capturing the atmosphere of the novel, and the spirit of the characters, while spicing up the ending for a more exciting and cinematic finish.Typical for MacLean, what is happening is shrouded in some mystery, which unfolds as Treasury agent Philip Calvert (Anthony Hopkins) conducts an investigation into the happenings along the Scottish coast, where a number of ships carrying shipments of gold bullion have mysteriously vanished. Eventually his attention is centered on shipping tycoon Sir Anthony Skouras (Jack Hawkins), and his yacht the Shangri-La.Also operating from a boat, Calvert gets his orders via radio from Sir Arthur Arnford-Jones (aka \"Uncle Arthur\") who is played with great gusto by Robert Morley. Calvert gains valuable information while checking the coastline in a helicopter, but is nearly killed when the chopper is shot down, and slides into the sea. Managing to get back to his ship, Calvert is joined by Uncle Arthur, and later by Skouras' wife Charlotte (Nathalie Delon), who says that her husband has been associating with undesirable types, and has plans to stop Calvert.Featuring settings with mostly overcast skies, When Eight Bells Toll has a moist and dreary atmosphere. Calvert operates similar to James Bond, and the film includes a number of nicely executed action scenes, including some which are undersea. A community wide deception, which is at the heart of the matter, is a bit of a stretch, but it seems to play rather smoothly, as does the recruitment of local fisherman to help in the cause.Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs,The Edge) does an excellent job of carrying the film. Calvert is extremely resourceful, and capable of great ruthlessness, repeatedly killing in cold blood without hesitation. Hopkins pulls it off well, without seeming fake or overly smug. Hardly known as a man of action, Robert Morley (Theater of Blood) is nonetheless very convincing, as a desk jockey who battles seasickness, and rises to the occasion, when pressed into frontline service.Staying fairly true to the source material, this effort should appeal to most MacLean fans, and is also a solid recommendation to those looking for some 70's style intrigue and adventure. Unfortunately the film is not yet available on Region 1 DVD. Image quality of the 2011 Region 2 PAL release by JL Entertainment is good, although color saturation seems a bit light. There are no extras except a trailer, but the film is subtitled in English.",

    "review/text": "This DVD set is much like the other DVD sets released so far in terms of how many episodes this set includes. That being said...Season 2, 7th Voyage holds 13 episodes...or episodes 131-143.Which includes the Post-Arabasta Arc, Goat Island Arc, and the Rainbow Mist Arc...which is just enough to leave viewers salivating for the start of Season 3, 1st Voyage (the start of the Skypeia arc) as for the Amazon price it's a bit much to ask for as these are all filler episodes included in this entire DVD set, but it's still a good buy if you can find it cheaper.The Post-Arabasta arc (ep. 131-135) is a pretty comedic arc for the most part but it's mostly just a range of episodes centered around each one of the Strawhat pirates either having a flashback of their own personal life, goofing off, or making short side trips on other islands where they help others.The Goat Island arc (ep. 136-138) is a really short filler arc, which thank goodness One Piece keeps a large majority of their fillers short. This arc just centers around the Strawhats running from the Marines and landing on an island with an old geezer named Zenny (the old man on the cover of this DVD set). Zenny is an old man that has a dream of becoming a pirate even though he's clearly too old to pursue that dream, the Strawhats still push to help him achieve that dream in the end.The Rainbow Mist arc (ep. 139-143) is an excellent filler arc in my personal opinion. The Strawhats land on Ruluka Island where a strange folktale of a mysterious cloak of mist is said to appear during certain times. An old man by the name of Professor Henzo, whom is researching the mist, lost a group of his friends to the mist a long long time ago. Needless to say the mist appears while the Strawhats are on Ruluka Island and Henzo is reunited with his friends inside the mist....but they don't recognize him? Why? because in the realm of the mist time is completely stopped and Henzo is an old geezer and his friends are still as young as the day they disappeared.I wanted to give a brief description of each arc this set contains without giving away too much about the arcs themselves. It's a product worth buying but at a lower price, personally I'd pay in the $25-$35 range for it.Note: Since the release of this item, Amazon has lowered the price to a much better range than it was originally listed. It was in the $40-$50 range, now it is much cheaper and right in the range that I personally would've bought it for as said in the review.",

Apparently Eichiro Oda, the creator of the One Piece manga, needed a rest after drawing the Alabasta arc as what we have here is 13 episodes of anime-only filler. Not that these are terrible episodes, but those who were looking for the earth shattering action of the previous volume won't find it here. These episodes were the last gasp of the much maligned 4Kids dub of One Piece and 7 of these episodes were skipped in that version, so those who are curious about what happened in the skipped episodes can see it here in this string of mini-adventures:*As the rest of the crew gathers food supplies on an uninhabited island, Chopper gets acquainted with newest crew member Nico Robin and reminisces about the first time his medical skills were put to the test.*Nami gets a great deal on some high quality paper from a travelling salesman and begins work on the world map that is her ultimate dream.*Usopp puts his inventing skills to work and helps a orphaned girl and her grandfather put on a fireworks display.*Luffy and Sanji briefly stow away on a Marine ship. As Luffy leads the Marines on a merry chase, Sanji subtlely helps the ship's apprentice cook to prepare a gourmet meal for visiting Marine captains.*Zoro reminisces about the time he first met his boon companions Johnny and Yosaku and battled the bandit chief Mountain Whale Dick.*The entire crew meets Zenny (who is pictured on the package), a retired money lender and hermit who has nearly given up hope of fulfilling his dream of becoming a pirate captain. Luffy and Co. help Zenny's dream to come true and drive off a corrupt Marine captain who wants to steal the treasure on Zenny's island.*The action picks up a bit in the last 5 episodes as the crew arrives in Ruluka, an island much like Miami Beach (or perhaps Bermuda) that lies near the Rainbow Mist, a mysterious cloud where many ships have been lost without a trace. A scientist on the island is trying to find his childhood friends who ventured into the mist 50 years before and Luffy volunteers to help him in his search. I won't give away much more except that the brutal mayor of Ruluka and the Marine captain and his crew who are patrolling nearby have a troubling connection with each other and with the Rainbow Mist.Next volume: A pirate's haven, treasure salvaging monkeys, a man who wants to live down the reputation of his \"liar\" ancestor, significant events in the larger world, and a thrilling journey to an island in the sky!",

We see his unusual sensitivity and introspective personality -- a real intellectual -- within the context of a deep pride that, like Uriah Heap, tends to feign humility. He is portrayed as at once smug, pitiful, too smart for his own good, and yet marvelously sincere. He manages to appear good even though he is a hideous murderer. It is the reverse of Dorian Grey. In Raskolnikov's case, the more we travel with him trying to cope with his murders and avoid prosecution, the more we sense his goodness. Though he is a murderer, I could not find it in myself to dislike him or to judge him harshly. Rather, I sympathized with him and with his moral and personal psychological struggles. Mr. Glover thus pulled off his role to a T, and the rest of the supporting cast really gave me a sense that I was in Russia where everyone is trying hard, and often succeeding in keeping up appearances; yet human degradation keeps breaking through. Sonja the prostitute turns out to be the most loving and noble of all those in the story; and, in a way, her love for Raskolnikov brings out the best in her. His crime/failure has a redemptive effect upon her life. If you are patient, and ripe for a deeper type of film experience, this version of Crime and Punishment is for you.",

A great cast and very entertaining as the westerns from this era are far superior to those of today. The movie shows just because you are superior in rank doesn't mean you know everything. The battle of wills between two of the greats John Wayne and Henry Fonda was handled beautifully by these two veteran actors. Throw in a great supporting cast of Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen, Shirley Temple, John Agar and you can't miss. I highly recommend this movie to add to your collection. Glad to see it finally came out on DVD.",

    "review/text": "My great-great grandfather was John Byrnes, an Irishman working as an indian scout at Ft. Apache in Arizona. What REALLY happened was this... a new officer arrived to take over the fort and wanted to arm the Indian scouts working at the fort. John Byrnes was a white man but was serving as a scout too. He objected and insisted the indians would simply take the guns and run. The officer thought he knew best and went ahead and armed the indian scouts. Before night fell, the indians had scaled the walls with the guns and vanished. John and the troopers went out in search of the (now armed) renegades, but during the outing, John contracted pneumonia and later died. His young bride took their infant daughter (my great grandmother) and left the fort to join her family on the Salt River (Phoenix). It has been 4 generations, but the family still carries some lingering anger over the officer who took command (played in the movie by Henry Fonda). Well, that's the real story of Fort Apache.",

    "review/text": "FORT APACHE, directed by John Ford, features John Wayne in a unusual detour, as the understated Captain Kirby York, Henry Fonda as an arrogant and hardheaded Lt. Col. Owen Thursday, and a grown up Shirley Temple as Philadelphia Thursday, Fonda's on-screen daughter. I viewed this film in a Native American Cinema course. We observed the tensions between soldiers, at the end of the American Civil War, with a local Indian tribe. While York (Wayne) believes that the Indians should be treated with respect, Lt. Col. Thursday thinks otherwise. Meanwhile, his daughter Philadelphia (Temple) is falling in love with Lt. Michael \"Mickey\" O'Rourke (John Agar). This is much to the great disapproval of her father.This is a film that depicted Native Americans in a rare, sympathetic light. We also see the ample tension that exists in the experience of Irish-American soldiers following the war. The acting, here, is at times interchangeably compelling (John Wayne is great, as is Henry Fonda) as well as annoying (Shirley Temple's character becomes little more than a curiousity--yes, this is the same Shirley Temple best known as a tap dancing three year old with ringlets). John Ford did a great job crafting this film. It is very engaging and well done. I definitely reccomend this as your introduction to his cinematic storytelling.",

    "review/text": "This John Ford classic has all the requirements for a great film. While a bit sappy at times with the old army Irish types, Victor Mclaughlin got a second life with these films, there is still enough here to engage the intellect. Shirely Temple is interesting to see grown up. Her acting style certainly did not evolve much over the years.What makes this film great are Fonda and Wayne, both playing roles opposite to their norm. Fonda is wonderfully arrogant and yet vulnerable at the same time. Wayne is humble and second fiddle for a change, he comes off well being the wiser, disgruntled subordinate. What really makes this film is the scenry an production quality. John Ford was painstakingly accurate with unifroms, equippment and gear. He provides a believeable image of army life, with all its pettiness and sense of honor. Everything is accurate down to the various bugle calls and the troop commands issued to the men. While there are obvious comparisons to Custer, what makes this film interesting is the sheer study of military incompetence. Fonda's character is desperate to make a name for himself, and he sacrefices his command in order to do so. The battle scenes are exciting to watch, even the old fashion carriage chase with the Indians running about is well done. In the end what is the message of this film? There probably isn't any exactly. Fonda's character creates a military disaster, pure and simple, yet we see that Wayne is willing to carry on this legacy of heroism to inspire the regiment in its continued campaigns against the hostiles. Here we see how myths are made from the most unlikely sources. A fine film all around, and probably the best of Ford's cavalry epics.",

    "review/text": "The first, and in my opinion, the best of John Ford's so-called Cavarly Trilogy. &quot;Fort Apache&quot; is Ford's thinly veiled re-telling of the Custer-Little Bighorn legend. A subject that fascinated Ford, but he didn't want to be hemmed in by the history so he completely changed the names and locations so he could tell the story the way he wanted to tell it.Henry Fonda plays a Custer-like Colonel who has seen his career's meteoric rise during the Civil War end with peacetime and an assignment to a frontier outpost. He resents this, and looks for an opportunity to earn fame and glory. He finds this opportunity at the expense of the Apaches who have left their reservation for good reasons. If he can defeat the Apaches then his career will certainly be boosted. Fonda's Colonel Thursday is a brave and competent officer, who does recognize some of the injustice and indignity that the reservation system has imposed upon the Apaches, but his lust for glory blinds him to everything in the end.John Wayne plays the competent, experienced second in command who clashes repeatedly with his superior. The film also features a love interest between a grown-up Shirley Temple and her then real-life husband John Agar. Being a Ford movie there is plenty of comic relief from various Irish NCO's, and romanticized vignettes of frontier cavalry life.",

    "review/summary": "Intelligent Landmark Western Of True Classic Status",
    "review/text": "The western genre has been probably one of the most frequently used in Hollywood filmmaking , at least until fairly recent times. In every decade there have been countless mediocre efforts and a few that have come down to us as true classics of the genre, whether it be for their great action sequences, good character studies or spectacular scenery. John Ford's 1948 \"Fort Apache\" is I believe one that belongs in the later category boasting excellence in all the three areas mentioned. The first installment in Ford's deservedly classic cavalry trilogy \"Fort Apache\", is strong on interesting character studies while never sacrificing the exciting action element which makes for a thrilling western. The teaming of veterans John Wayne and Henry Fonda in characters that have personalites that are bound to collide makes for much of the fine dramatic meat of this story. The film is also a standout in this genre for presenting a sympathetic and dignified image of the Indian races depicted in the story which helps give the film a certain uniqueness for western efforts from this period in Hollywood history.The conflict element central to this entire story is introduced very quickly when we see Col. Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda), reluctantly arriving at Fort Apache to take up command of this outpost against his will. He has with him his young daughter Philadelphia (Shirley Temple), and almost before he is settled into his new home he comes into opposition with the local Captain York (John Wayne). York has extensive knowledge of the region and by his fairness and respectful dealings has earned the trust of the Indian population on the reservation however he immediately clashes with the unbending and unrealistic views that Col. Thursday has about outpost discipline and more importantly in the handling of the native population. Good men like Capt. Collingwood (George O'Brien), find themselves relieved of their formerly held posts and Col. Thursday is soon even in conflict with his daughter when she begins a romance with the dashing young 2nd Lt. Michael O'Rourke (John Agar), a man who in Col. Thursday's belief is way below her social station in life. The simmering conflicts at the fort reach a head when it is learnt that the local Indian population have moved out of their agreed reservation and after Capt. York meets with the Indian leader Cochise (Miguel Inclan), and agrees to further peaceful talks, he finds his own reputation on the line when Col. Thursday refuses to be dictated to by the Indians and is prepared to use force if necessary to get them back on the reservation. When an agreement can't be reached even after the real reason why the Indians left the reservation is discovered revealing vast exploitation of the native population by greedy men at the outpost store Col. Thursday, used to military glory sees his opportunity for further praise in his uncompromising handling of the Indians who he regards simply as rebels despite their wish for peace. Insulting the Indian leaders despite their efforts to stay within the agreed treaty it then seems that war is inevitable. Disaster strikes when however when refusing Capt. York's sound advice on battle strategies in this region Col. Thursday leads a whole battalion into a terrible ambush which sees all of the men killed with he also becoming a victim of his own inability to understand both the Indians and his own men.Westerns as a rule are not renowned for their strong character studies or examinations of Indian and white men's belief about living together however John Ford has achieved that with this excellent examination of all the conflicting attitudes that made up life in the early west frontier. The performances delivered by both Henry Fonda and John Wayne are among their best with Fonda excelling as the type of leader we love to hate, a man driven by his past achievements who is determined to follow those despite what others say. John Wayne working with his favourite director here again delivers a very appealing performance as the decent Captain who finds all his years of experience in warfare and importantly in developing the trust of the Indians coming to naught in the face of Capt. York's rigid set of beliefs. Both men square off against each other in a highly effective manner and add the main dramatic element to the story giving \"Fort Apache\", alot of its memorable quality. The supporting players are also first rate. \"Fort Apache\", provides us with a glimpse of the teenage Shirley Temple long after her reign as Hollywood's greatest child star and she provides the typical romantic element here teaming with real life future husband John Agar in his film debut. Pedro Armendariz, Victor McLaglen and especially Ward Bond in his touching performance as Sgt. Maj. O'Rourke all add their expertise to their individual scenes and help make \"Fort Apache\", a story rich with solid large and small characterisations. Of course being a John Ford western the visuals are of the greatest importance and Ford's favourite location of Monument Valley is well utilised in the story as a magnificent backdrop to the proceedings. The films many great action sequences that display some excellent stunt work also go a long way towards earning this film its classic status with the famous shoot out at the climax where Col. Thursday and his men perish being rarely equalled for excitment and tragedy.Even if you are not a great western fan there is much to enjoy in \"Fort Apache\". The main characters are not cardboard cut outs and the main conflicts in the story between firstly the characters played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne and in the wider one between the white men and the Indians are not provided with easy solutions and always try to show both sides of the conflict. It is this lack of everything being depicted as black and white as is so often seen in westerns that makes \"Fort Apache\", such interesting viewing and which deservedly earns it the accolade of being a great classic of this genre, enjoy!",

The film, ironically, finds Henry Fonda playing the maddeningly hawkish cavalry commander against John Wayne's humanistic officer willing to risk all for peace and justice.The (single) DVD has no documentary on the exciting and heartfelt film, a shame. It does include a 15-minute piece on Monument Valley, covering Ford's significant and seemingly beneficial role in the Indian reservation's history. The Navajo, paid good wages for their appearances, called him \"Giant Soldier.\" \"I've kissed more babies than a politician,\" Ford said.\"Part of his vision of the world was that we're all very small in the scheme of things,\" film historian Joseph McBride says. \"I think (Monument Valley) gives a dimension of moral seriousness to his work that was intensified as he went along.\"[...]",

Henry Fonda delivers a bravura performance as the martinet Colonel Owen Thursday. It's difficult to hate Fonda in anything, but this is perhaps his most unsympathetic role. John Wayne more than holds in own in a lesser role and he added much luster to his growing status as a Western icon.Ford's familiar stock company is in full evidence, with steller performances by regulars Victor McLaglen and Ward Bond. Shirley Temple delivers an adequate adult performance and her scenes with Fonda are especially effective.This is one of the great westerns ever made and full appreciation of it has been slow in coming. I highly recommend it to anyone with an appreciation of this genre. Fonda's performance alone makes this a must-see classic.",

    "review/text": "To be totally honest, this is the only western I like. Now I know what my grandparents mean when they exclaim nostalgically when watching an old movie on their favorite movie channel, AMC, \"They don't make 'em like they used to!\" This film has made me a loyal AMC fan, and it's the only channel I tune into nowadays. Believe me, if you're looking for good old-fashioned entertainment, this one is the ideal choice. It has everything to offer: great comic relief, romance, tragedy, adventure and keeps you on the edge of your sofa throughout the whole show. By the way, if you're interested, it features an all-star cast that consists of the Duke of Western classics, John Wayne, Henry Fonda,Shirley Temple,John Agar and Ward Bond, and is directed by the movie mastermind, John Ford. All the ingredients for a true Western classic!First of all, Henry Fonda excels in his role as the domineering, 'martinet' type Colonel Owen Thursday. Sure, I learned to scorn him in the duration of the show,but I realized that it was clearly what the character demanded. At the beginning I was already thinking to myself, ' Sheesh, where the heck did that Thursday guy get his inflated ego! What a rat!'I'd give him a big thumbs up for pulling off a real stupid role and making it the best he possibly could. But, I have to admit, in the scene where he's leading a charge at the Apaches ( the 'bad guys') in an airhead procedure, I found myself rooting for the 'savage' Indians. Oh, well . . .John Wayne was good in his unimportant role of Kirby York, who constantly clashes with the stupidly unreasonable and egotistical Colonel Thursday. I could really sympathize with the Duke there. I mean, who wants to work with a ... mad-man like Thursday? He was always putting his men at risk in the battlefield in thrown together strategies that were given no time or thought. It made me sick. And such a big shot! It was so obvious that he considered himself hot stuff, which is totally bogus! I kinda pitied the Duke; not just because he was put under the order of Thursday, but because he was constantly in Fonda's shadow throughout the film. But, I give him a high five for playing the sensible, practical, gritty and honest 'tough-guy' hero, his trademark role.And last, but not least, a standing ovation to Shirley and John Agar! Those two were just so unbelievably sweet and compelling as the lovers. By today's cruddy standards, where ... flicks are the general 'romance thrillers', their romance would be considered real 'cute'. But, personally, I thought they were thrilling - truly thrilling, especially during their two kiss scenes. True, they weren't extremely passionate, considering they shared their first kiss after they became engaged. But still, their delicate, gentle love scenes stole the show! Not only were they adoreable, they made the perfect couple. Gosh, Agar's good looks and debonair, yet still boyish and innocent manner made my heart stand still, and Shirley's darling smiles and simpers were real scene stealers! She looked prettier in this film than in any other I've seen her. The rest of this film could be a little lackluster, but I never failed to be spellbound during the Shirley/John scenes. What an angelic pair! They brought an innocense and sweet magic to the screen, something that's not seen often today in our jaded world. Their youth and vigor and vitality certainly won my heart. You cannot imagine how disgusted I was with that Colonel Thursday, who was Shirley's father in the movie, when he forbade the two to wed after John Agar ( Lt. Michael Shannon O'Rourke) asked him for his daughter's hand in marriage. I thought I'd blow when Colonel Thursday explained, in his cold, stern tones, \" I'm afraid I must deny you my daughter's hand in marriage due to the apparent barriers between your class and mine.\" Shut up, Thursday! Have a little compassion here, please. Also, he was a real control ... regarding his daughter, too, beautiful and vivacious 16-year old Philadelphia Thursday, who was head over heels in love with her Lt. O'Rourke. He had a strict curfew and wouldn't let her talk or look at her rejected suitor. He even considered sending her away from the fort to an academy ' where she'd have two years to forget about Michael.' When Thursday was killed during the battle scene at the end, I felt a wave of relief flow over me. Yes, now Michael and Phil could get married. They did, and had a little boy in the last scene of the approx. two hour film. He was a real cutie, too! What a fabulous ending to a true classic! Though I'm only twelve years old and this movie would be snubbed as 'corny old junk' by my peers, I must say I sincerely enjoyed watching 'Fort Apache' and wish my age group would grow up and realize just how special and priceless this classic is, even if it is old. Entertainment, like fine wine, improves with age. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone interested in history, cowboy and indian entertainment,or Henry Fonda, John Wayne , Shirley Temple , John Agar fans, or to whomever wants a taste of some real good old-fashioned entertainment! This movie has charm and taste, and is a real pleasure to see in our now classless, charmless and tastless society. Please take the time to check it out at the nearest video arcade or store and I know you'll fall in love with it! And fasten your seatbelts for a rip-roaring good time - Yahoo!!",

Fonda plays an arrogant, by-the-book stiff commander who will have nothing less than a to-the-death struggle with Cochise. Wayne is his subordinate, trying desperately to avoid catasrophe.This film has it all, great performances, great direction, and great cinematography. It is way past time that this great film be released on DVD, but it is well worth the wait.",

The NAVAJOS, resided (and still do) in Monument Valley, NOT the APACHES. This and a few other petty elements kind of marred the film. Atypical of Wayne's films: Compromising authenticity for dramatic scenery and what not. But the ending portrayed realistic Apache indian guerrilla tactics. It wasn't a typical scene where (as in most westerns) the infantry wipes out indians with ease; just the opposite was true. Apaches were the greatest guerrilla-fighters the world has ever had.",

    "review/text": "The video's introduction, provided by TCM movie guru Robert Osborne, describes this as \"the typical John Ford western.\" That may well be. Unfortunately, it doesn't really compliment Ford as an auteur, or even a director, because this is the one Ford film I've seen so far (out of eight) that I would truly call unfocused. It does snap into a decent plot by the last forty-five minutes, but until that time the main thrust of the picture is watered down by too many characters, too many \"side moments,\" and too many changes in tone.Maybe it's because the plot is so basic, and has to be dragged out to the prerequisite, John Ford just-over-two-hours. Lt Col Thursday (Henry Fonda) is a somewhat failed Civil War general, reassigned to lead the cavalry regiment at Fort Apache, who sees his one chance for true military glory in what should be a small dispute with the Indians. Opposing him, in various ways, are his daughter Philadelphia (Shirley Temple!), her sweetheart Lt O'Rourke (John Agar), the far less uptight Captain York (John Wayne), and most of the men of this rag-tag regiment. Where York sees an opportunity for peace, Thursday sees a major battle - and a place in history.It doesn't sound bad, right? And it's not. It is, however, terribly wayward. There is a lot of time - more htan is necessary - spent on Philadelphia's romance, and there are loads of aggravating \"comic relief\" scenes with the rowdy, hard-drinkin' officers. Ward Bond makes a strong impression as Major O'Rourke (Agar's character's father), but John Wayne himself - the guy with top billing - doesn't make any sort of impact until the film is half over. And the lead casting is downright odd; I find it very hard to swallow Henry Fonda as a militaristic hard-ass, a role one would more typically associate with Wayne. To his credit, though, Wayne actually comes across well in a softer vein than usual, and for those (like me) who have always wondered about his range, it's a pleasantly surprising performance.The Indians themselves don't make an appearance until about forty-five minutes from the end, and it's there that the line between Fonda and Wayne - hinted at, but not acted upon, for most of the second act - is finally drawn. The film abruptly realizes that it is, indeed, a film with a point, and quickly staggers into some semblance of a consistent tone and narrative. What's left is quite good, and Ford handles the battle sequences skillfully, as well as the slightly corny epilogue, but I found myself wishing I actually cared a little more. There's good characterization in the movie, for sure, but it's thrown out in such tiny little morsels that, pretty much, only Fonda, Wayne, and Bond feel like anything more than ciphers. I thought The Grapes of Wrath had pacing trouble, cramming so much into two hours? This is the precise opposite problem. At 90 minutes \"Fort Apache\" might well have been a classic. At 127 - it's simply too long. Recommended if you're a particularly great fan of the Western, I suppose, but I would still wait til it showed up on TV.",

Apart from critiquing the sensationalization of military heroics and the myth of the \"savage,\" Ford works in sequences of everyday frontier rituals, like dances, chores, and even a romance involving Thursday's daughter, played by an all grown-up Shirley Temple. With its exquisite black-and-white shots of Monument Valley, assured acting, and Custer-esque storyline, \"Apache\" is an enduring Western winner.",

    "review/text": "This movie, whose setting is the post-Civil War west during the Indian Wars, features Shirley Temple as a teenager in love with one of the cavalry officers. It also repudiates those who accuse westerns in general, and John Wayne ones in particular, of necessarily reinforcing racist stereotypes about Indians.While many of the cavalrymen viewed Indians as violent, dishonorable savages, Captain York (John Wayne) saw the Apaches as a Nation entitled to fairness and respect. (This film was made in 1948, at a time when Indians were usually the bad guys.) When the cavalrymen condemned Chief Cochise for breaking a treaty by abandoning the Reservation, Captain York understood, and defended, this as an understandable reaction to a local dealer who was corrupting the Indians with worthless trinkets and alcohol (and debauched alcohol at that), steadily converting them into a nation of drunks. Captain York wanted to live in peace with the Indians.This movie is also a tale of military loyalty. Although Commander Thursday was unfair to Captain York, and had led the men (and himself) into a foolish and disastrous combat encounter with the Indians, Captain York praises his fallen leader in front of the press.",

    "review/text": "Fort Apache is a 1948 western film directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne and Henry Fonda. The film was the first of the director's \"cavalry trilogy\" and was followed by She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Rio Grande (1950), both starring Wayne. The story, which screenwriter James Warner Bellah based loosely on George Armstrong Custer and the Battle of Little Bighorn, as well as the Fetterman Massacre of 1866, was one of the first to present an authentic and sympathetic view of the Native Americans involved in the battle (Apache in the film, Sioux in the real battles).The film was awarded the Best Director and Best Cinematography awards by the Locarno International Film Festival of Locarno, Switzerland.After the end of the American Civil War, the veteran, well-respected Captain Kirby York (John Wayne) is expected by the regimental personnel of Fort Apache, an isolated U.S. cavalry post, to replace the outgoing commander. York had commanded his own regiment during the Civil War and was well-qualified to assume permanent command. To their surprise and disappointment, the command of the regiment was given to Lieutenant Colonel Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda). Thursday, a West Pointer, was a General during the Civil War. Despite his Civil War combat record, Lieutenant Colonel Thursday lacks experience to deal with the Indians he is expected to watch, and is a very arrogant officer and martinet.Accompanying widower Thursday is his daughter, Philadelphia (Shirley Temple). She becomes attracted to Second Lieutenant Michael Shannon O'Rourke (John Agar), the son of Sergeant Major Michael O'Rourke (Ward Bond). The elder O'Rourke had won the Medal of Honor, entitling his son to enter West Point and become an officer. However, the class-conscious Thursday forbids his daughter to see someone he does not consider a gentleman, despite the fact that Sergeant Major O'Rourke had served during the Civil War as a Major with the Irish Brigade and went on to earn the Medal of Honor for his bravery under fire.When there is unrest among the Indians, led by Cochise (Miguel Inclan), Thursday ignores York's advice to treat the natives with honor and that the problems are caused by corrupt Indian agents. His arrogant behavior drives the Indians to rise up. Eager for glory and recognition, Thursday orders his regiment into battle on Cochise's terms, despite York's urgent warnings.By deliberately misinterpreting his orders York spares the younger O'Rourke from battle. However, Thursday's entire command is wiped out. Thursday himself survives but then returns to die with the last of his men. Cochise spares York's detachment because he knows York to be an honorable man.Subsequently, now-Lieutenant Colonel Kirby York commands the regiment. Meeting with correspondents introduces Lt. O'Rourke, now married to Thursday's daughter. A reporter asks if he has seen the famous painting depicting \"Thursday's Charge.\" York, about to command a new and arduous campaign to bring in the Apaches, says it is completely accurate and then reminds the reporters that the soldiers will never be forgotten as long as the regiment lives.Some exteriors for the film were shot in Monument Valley, Utah. The exteriors involving the fort itself and the renegade Indian agent's trading post were filmed at Corriganville, which is now a park in Simi Valley, California.",

The Searchers shines due to its externals, but Apache proceeds and then later culminates in a richer, deeper and more satisfying way, and the whole movie experience resonates with you in a way that The Searchers does not quite achieve.",

    "review/text": "It's fascinating to compare this 1948 pairing of director John Ford and John Wayne with Stagecoach, which they did together in 1939. In 1939 Wayne was a 'kid' and the Indians were a faceless menace which could not be reasoned with. Not even ten years later, Wayne is a weathered, wise Captain on a remote outpost, very sympathetic with the local natives. The Indians are now a complex, mistreated group who are deserving of respect.The landscape and lifestyle is simply gorgeous in this film even though it's black and white. The love of music, the heartachingly gorgeous vistas and carved rocks, the soaring skies all make you want to immediately take a trip to the west. There are a variety of characters here - the defeated Rebels from the civil war, the stereotypical group of drinking Irish, the shopkeeps who take advantage of the natives and the men of honor who try to do the right thing.The local cavalry group is happy hanging out in their remote outpost when Henry Fonda - Col. Thursday - shows up with his slightly ditsy but good natured daughter, Philadelphia (Shirley Temple!). Philly playfully explains that Pomfret CT and not Pennsylvania lay in her past. Soon the local west point grad is in love with her - but despite his officer rank and the fact that his dad won the medal of honor, Thursday feels the romance is entirely inappropriate - a breach of class etiquette.In fact, Thursday calls the lad an \"uncilized Indian\" for taking his daughter out without permission. He feels he's educated and worthy of great glory - he researched the tactics of Khan, Alexander the Great and others. When it comes to real life, however, he is lacking in wisdom.While the group is sitting around enjoying 1846 port, the natives are restless. Thusrday disdanfully complains that while others get to joust with \"the 'great indian nations' of Sioux and Cheyenne, we get the gnat-stains and flea- bites of a few digger indians.\" Wayne, annoyed, responds, \"You'd hardly call the Apaches digger indians.\" Says Thursday, \"You'd scarely compare them with the Sioux ...\" When Wayne tries to talk about the Apaches destroying the Sioux, Thursday ignores him.Soon, because local trader Meacham has been only giving them rotgut whiskey, giving them \"whiskey but no beef\", Chochise, Diablo, Geronimo and others take off with numerous Mescaleros and Chiricahuas for the south border. Meacham is dismissive - \"You know how children are\". Wayne goes in to talk peace with them, and no sooner has he negotiated one but Thursday decides to kill them all for glory. When Wayne complains about the damage to his honor, Thursday sneers about the value of \"Your word to a breech-clothed savage\".Unfortunately for Thursday's wild plan, the cavalry are soon surrounded and outnumbered four to one. Thurday reluctantly agrees to talk - and again his lack of wisdom shines through as he abandons all diplomacy and openly insults them. It's pretty inevitable what follows.On one hand you could complain that even though there are supposed to be multiple branches of the Apache clan represented, you tend to only see generic indians on ridges with regular shirts and bandanas. But compared to the stories done just ten years ago, the changes are pretty stunning. Now it's the whites who are the senseless marauders, and the natives who are merely trying to find a peaceful way to live. Unfortunately, it's the cavalrymen who get stuck in the center.A very important movie to watch, to see how the shifting sands adjust in perceptions over time - and to admire the gorgeous landscapes of the old west.",

Henry Fonda is excellent as the martinent who alienates his men and clashes with Wayne's Captain York throughout the film, their differences exploding during a peace parley with the Apaches which ends in a rousing cavalry-Indian engagement near the end of the movie. Ford's regulars, led by Ward Bond, Victor McLaglen and Hank Worden are among the cast members, and Shirley Temple and John Agar provide the romantic angle in the proceedings. The black and white cinematography by Archie Stout is striking and Richard Hageman's wistful score are among the film's top notch production values.",

    "review/text": "...by Henry Fonda as a Custer-like commanding officer who is looking for glory in the wrong place. Stung by the army posting him in such a backwater outpost as Fort Apache, Fonda hits on the idea of taking on Cochese, who has abandonned his treaty due to the reprehensible treatment of his people at the hands of the Indian Bureau. Underestimating the grievances and ability of the Apaches, Fonda picks a fight and, well, the results are unfortunate.This is one of Ford's more subtle westerns, with tremendous character development, and a sympathetic view of the plight of the Apaches. The black and white cinematography of Ford's famous Monument Valley is spectacular, and the score is effective in conveying the majesty of military ceremony, pomp and circumstance. The rest of the cast is fine. John Wayne gives a controlled performance as the disapproving second-in-command, Ward Bond is the brave and watchful father of newcomer John Agar, and Victor McLaglen, Dick Foran, and Pedro Armendariz are a hilarious trio of sergeants who really enjoy their liquor. Miguel Inclan makes an impressive Cochese who outwits Henry Fonda at every turn. The Irish theme woven through the film is charming, as is the teen-aged Shirley Temple (she dances with John Wayne!) who makes a sweet and appealing love interest along with her first husband John Agar. The intimate view of army outpost life is interesting, and contributes to the character development. The shoot 'em up stuff is where it belongs, but does not control the film until the end, where the audience sees the futility of battling the Apaches who have more than a compelling argument for being unhappy with their end of the bargain. A really splendid western and a fine film.",

    "review/text": "This is the first of Ford's cavalry trilogy, thought by many to be the best. I have nothing to add to the prior excellent summaries of this movie, but perhaps can shed a bit of light on what makes it special from the point of view of movie history. The first point of interest is the stars. Ford did many several fine movies with Fonda, in particular Young Mr Lincoln, but gradually seemed to express a preference for Wayne - probably because he was more overtly heroic - closer to Ford's mythological ideal of the Great Westerner. Fonda's heroism was more understated, often more cerebral. But, here we have a different Fonda - a bitter, incompetent misfit promoted over the head of the much more qualified, but younger, Wayne. Both actors give their best and, although Fonda's talent is rarely questioned, never let it be said that Wayne could not act. He is superb in this trilogy, playing a range of ages brilliantly - the same character in Fort Apache and Rio Grande, and the more elderly Nathan Brittles in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon. Wayne also manages to convince with his portrayal of a man who genuinely understands the plight of the Indians it is his job to police, and sympathises with them. This is, to my knowledge, Fonda's first foray into the role of the anti-hero - although fatally-flawed might be a more appropriate description. Nearly twenty years later he really made the transition in the splendid Once Upon a Time in the West.Of equal interest in this movie, and a source of great aesthetic delight, is Ford's portrayal of Monument Valley as art. Taking advantage of black and white, he shows inumerable settings of different types of sky against carefully chosen geographical profiles that are simply stunningly beautiful. The more so, as they are used to emphasise the stark isolation of this conflict between the relentless development of the United States and the centuries-old right to roam of nomadic tribesmen.Finally, another item of particular interest is that Fort Apache featured former rodeo star Ben Johnson as the riding stunt double for Henry Fonda. The horses pulling a wagon, with three men on it, stampeded. Johnson galloped after it and managed to pull it to a halt before anyone was injured. A grateful Ford promised Johnson some work for his bravery, and the quiet man from Oklahoma was anticipating a more secure few years as a stuntman. Instead, he was rewarded with a 7-year acting contract! Thus, was born the career of the inestimable Trooper Tyree; a character who, for me, gives Rio Grande and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon the edge over Fort Apache. If you want Tyree in chronological order, see Rio Grande first; not to mention dozens of other films that Johnson lifts above the ordinary.I'll tell you what; why not buy all three of the trilogy? I'm not particularly a Western buff, but I love these movies. They are allegories for life; and anyone wanting to understand America could make no better start than with John Ford and his myths.",

All of them are contrived and somewhat sappy; I watch them and envision a cherubic Mickey Rooney looking on while eating chocolate chip cookies and drinking milk. &quot;That's a swell show, Dad!&quot;But I like John Ford films. And I really like FORT APACHE, despite the movie being a stereotypical product of its time. Why, you ask (or mutter indifferently)? Because this film actually depicts some range for Henry Fonda and the Duke himself. Fonda plays a very unsympathetic role, while John Wayne steps out of character (for him) to play a compassionate second fiddle. And Ford's experiment works: the two actors pull off exceptional performances; their on-screen chemistry is riveting.Tension--that's the motor that drives FORT APACHE. A new disciplined, disgruntled, by-the-book colonel (Fonda) arrives at a remote Arizona outpost; immediately, he is at odds with the fort's seasoned and weathered captain (Wayne). The captain, who possesses a deep respect for a band of Apache that has left the reservation, has the loyalty and affection of his men; the colonel is looked upon as an unwelcome intruder and resented as a martinet. The two officers wage a battle of wills that ultimately has Fonda using an unsuspecting Wayne as a ploy to draw the Apache back for a surprise attack--a strategy that produces deadly consequences.This is good stuff, further enhanced by some outstanding supporting roles, including Ward Bond, Pedro Armendariz, and Victor McLaglen. We're even treated to a grown-up--yet still annoying--Shirley Temple. Kudos to John Ford for creating a good-looking film that successfully had Fonda and Wayne step outside their respective boxes. FORT APACHE, despite its &quot;Aw, shucks&quot; big studio smarm, is solid entertainment.--D. Mikels",

First off the music caught my ear and the words to the songs became stuck in my head! Pleasantly so though.With being used to modern, action packed and special effect loaded movies of today, which I love and go to see often, I was entertained by the simplicity of the movie. The story line was simple with clear cut \"good vs bad\" and strong characters who wanted to do the right thing.The movie was filmed in the west and the outdoor scenes were very good. I thought the Native American portrayal was not that bad considering the time period the movie was made.John Wayne surprised me as I found his acting to be good and of course Henry Fonda is a classic actor. So, I watched the entire movie and I enjoyed it, I did not get bored, and I ended up buying a copy for myself!So, if you like the \"old west\" give this fifties movie a chance.",

    "review/text": "While I like \"Fort Apache,\" I feel that there is too much horseplay in the movie as well as too much Shirley Temple-John Agar. Joanne Dru is far superior in a similar type of role in the follow-up \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.\" The screenplay to \"Fort Apache\" could have been tightened up dropping about 10 minutes and giving it a more streamlined result. \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" is a superior film because of a better handled script. Having said that, \"Fort Apache\" is still very entertaining. Its strength is in its opposing characters played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It's easy to focus on Fonda's martinet of a commander, but Wayne is excellent in his somewhat secondary role. He's almost an observer on equal footing with the supporting players and that generosity pays off with a very likeable, heroic character. I don't like \"Fort Apache\" enough to add it to my collection, as I have \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,\" but it's still a film to watch and enjoy.",

This film was also the first of what became known as Ford's Cavalry Trilogy. The others were SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON 1949) and RIO GRANDE (1950) and were Ford's splendid tribute to the U.S. Cavalry and as such deserve to be judged as a body of work that as yet has no equal!Wayne in this film shares top billing with Henry Fonda who a couple of years earlier had starred as the hero Wyatt Earp in John Ford's marvellous MY DARLING CLEMENTINE (1946) this time Ford has him as the unsympathetic martinet Lt Col Owen Thursday against the experienced Captain Kirby York (John Wayne). Incidentally when Wayne reprised this role for the last outing in the trilogy in RIO GRANDE he not only gained promotion but an extra letter to his name by becoming Lt Col Kirby Yorke.The story is basically a study of frontier life against the backdrop of the Indian Wars and the end bears more than a passing resemblance to Custer's Last Stand with the Fonda character leading his men into an Apache massacre from which few return. The final theme when it's all over was \"when the legend becomes fact, print the legend\" which would be used to such good effect in the aforementioned THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE some fourteen years later.",

    "review/summary": "An Enduring Classic",
    "review/text": "This is my favorite among the several westerns which Ford directed. When seeing it again recently, I was again struck by how relevant this film is to the contemporary business world, more specifically in terms of issues which concern leadership and management. In his recently published Why Smart Executives Fail, Sydney Finkelstein identifies a number of specific lessons which can be learned from \"spectacularly unsuccessful\" executives such as Dennis Kozlowski, Jean-Marie Messier, and Jill Barad. In an article published by Fast Company magazine (July 2003), he lists seven self-defeating and destructive habits:1. They see themselves and their companies dominating their environment.2. They identify so completely with the company that there is no clear boundary between their personal interests and their corporate interests.3. They think they have all the answers.4. They ruthlessly eliminate anyone who isn't 100% behind them.5. They are consummate spokespersons, obsessed with the company image.6. They underestimate obstacles.7. They stubbornly rely on what worked for them in the past.In Fort Apache, Lieutenant Colonel Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda) displays all of the seven habits identified and then so brilliantly discussed by Finkelstein. Captain Kirby York (John Wayne) repeatedly tries without any success whatsoever to dissuade his commanding officer from behavior which ultimately results in his (Thursday's) death and the slaughter of most of those under his command. Near the end of the film in his final remarks to journalists, York defends \"Thursday's Charge,\" not to protect Thursday's reputation but to protect the honor of those whom the vainglorious Thursday led to their deaths. York also wishes to preserve the honor of the U.S. Cavalry.Brilliantly filmed in black-and-white by Louis Clyde Stouman and Archie J. Stout, Fort Apache captures the natural beauty but also the isolation in which the fort is located and to which the obviously unhappy Thursday is assigned following the reduction of his rank. (No reasons are given for the assignment and demotion, both of which Thursday bitterly resents.) Ford includes several sub plots, notably the mutual attraction of Lieutenant Michael O'Rourke (John Agar) and Thursday's daughter Philadelphia (Shirley Temple) and the role of the corrupt government civilian official, Silas Meacham (Grant Withers). Of course, several members of the Ford Repertory Players (Pedro Armendariz, Ward Bond, Dick Foran, Ben Jonson, and Victor McLaglen) are also in the excellent cast.The focus of the film, however, is on the conflict between Thursday and York. More specifically, between Thursday's stubborn commitment to mindsets and habits such as those Finkelstein identifies and York's determination to avoid further hostilities. York respects Cochise and the Apaches whereas Thursday views them with contempt. Worse yet, Thursday tragically underestimates their judgment and skills as warriors. Of course, York knows better. Much as Cochise wants to avoid bloodshed, Thursday leaves him no choice after insulting him in front of other Apache leaders (including Geronimo) as well the cavalry officers nearby. I shall never forget Cochise's profound sadness when realizing that there is no longer any hope for peace. The results of \"Thursday's Charge\" are a foregone conclusion.Even after 55 years, this film remains visually stunning and retains its dramatic impact. For these and other reasons, it is among my favorite westerns and, in my opinion, the best of the westerns which John Ford directed.",

They do not seem to obey exactly the rules of the establishment, but seem to merge with the inner passion and natural commitment, that in certain moments may agree with the state of things but not always fit; there is something out of context in their attitudes. They fight following their own codes.This is a clear example: Fonda like Icarus decides to confront the Apaches, despite John Wayne 's wisdom so typical of Athena 's prudence who advises not to make it; once more face the mature wisdom and the irreverent epic mood, which eventually will clash with the expected consequences.An admirable saga and the First part of his Trilogy.",

    "review/text": "A truly excellent western, one of the all-time greats; the only reason it's not a full 5 stars is there are a few which are marginally better, such as &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; and &quot;Shane&quot;.Both Henry Fonda and John Wayne are cast against type here, and both prove what great actors they are. Fonda plays a stubborn, excessively proud army commander (loosely based on General George Armstrong Custer) furious at being sent to an outpost in Arizona to fight the Apache, complaining they're not even the &quot;tough&quot; Indians. Wayne is a looser, kinder man more adjusted to living in the middle of nowhere, beloved by his men, and holding much more respect for the Apache since he's dealt with them many times. Fonda insists on using the Apache's trust of Wayne against them, luring them into a trap to force them back onto the reservation. Wayne does his best to stop it, but the forces are already at work and there's little he can do. The ensuing massacre (remember, this tale is based on the exploits of Custer) leaves Wayne with the dilemma: tell the truth about Fonda, or go along with the typical &quot;national-hero&quot; myth that has developed around his death?This is not your typical western. The cavalry aren't the bad guys (as they would be portrayed 40 years later in &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;), but the Indians aren't exactly the bad guys, either. Their treatment on the reservation at the hands of a corrupt American government, providing them with scant food to survive but plenty of rotgut whiskey to demoralize and destroy them, is clearly presented. The Indians (portrayed here mostly by Mexican actors) are justifiably angry as their trust in &quot;the great white father&quot; is betrayed over and over. They are presented as intelligent strategists; they offer Fonda a legitimate chance to sit down and talk, but when they're betrayed yet again they go on the offense and, incredibly, they don't lose the fight. This was a western far ahead of its time, and since it was directed by the great John Ford it isn't just a moral tract: it's a beautifully-photographed and expertly-acted drama that pulls you in and teaches you something at the same time. Great stuff.",

    "review/text": "Reading reviews of the cavalry trilogy movies (Fort Apache, She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, & Rio Grande) you will possibly hear appreciation for the director, the actors, the locations, etc., but one thing you may not hear is appreciation for the author who put pen and ink to paper to write all these stories that found their way to the movie screen.His name was James Warner Bellah and from his short story, MASSACRE, published by Curtis Publishing Company in 1947 came the framework for the movie Fort Apache. Other of his stories form the background for the other 2 cavalry pictures, as well as the later movie, SERGEANT RUTLEDGE.All these stories, 10 in total, later appeared in a Fawcett Gold Medal paperback (s1218) entitiled REVEILLE which sold for 35 cents in June, 1962. The fort was called Fort Starke in the stories and this is how Fawcett summarized the book: \"A choice collection of great stories that thunder the glory of the old horse soldiers in their final triumphant days at Fort Starke ... This is what it was like\".I have two copies of that 1962 Fawcett Gold Medal paperback, as well as two copies of the June, 1960, .35 cent Bantam paperback western A2085: SERGEANT RUTLEDGE.As Paul Harvey would say: now you know the rest of the story.Semper Fi.",

    "review/summary": "Fort Apache: The Custer Massacre Retold",
    "review/text": "Director John Ford began his trilogy of the bluecoat versus Indian trilogy with FORT APACHE in 1948. The film was such a hit that he quickly followed with a pair of sequels, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON and RIO GRANDE. John Wayne played basically the same character in each, a grizzled, weary veteran of the Indian wars who is one of the few people in any of the three films who sees the Indians sympathetically. In FORT APACHE, he is Captain Kirby York, who has to adjust to being in second command to a martinet of a commander, Colonel Owen Thursday, played by Henry Fonda in only one of two unsympathetic roles in a very long film career (ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is the other). Captain York wants to bring an end to the Indian wars, so he meets Cochise and Geronimo and gives them his word that they will be treated fairly. Of course, Colonel Thursday decides to attack the Indians in a surprise assault that fools nobody. Colonel Thursday is seen as a clone of General Custer who had much the same idea of surprising 5,000 Indian warriors. It is hard to find any sympathy for Thursday. Every word that he utters is starkly unemotional. He is about as fair with the Indians as he is with his own daughter Philadelphia (Shirley Temple) when he refuses consent to her marriage with a dashing cavalry lieutenant played by the blandly handsome John Agar, who, in real life, married Shirley soon after the film was released. The highlight of the film is a characteristic of John Ford, a smashingly effective use of onrushing troopers led into a cavalry charge with a bugler tooting the way. The battle scene of trooper versus Indian inevitably draws comparison with the real life massacre of the 7th Cavalry under General Custer. The role of the Indian in this and the other two installments is one of the few instances in which the Indian is not seen as the inherently bad guy. In fact, Cochise and Geronimo were both willing to abide by a verbal treaty and Colonel Thursday's verbal harangue of the two proud chiefs clearly invests them with some sympathy. The viewer is left with the distinct impression that if the west had had more Captain Yorks and fewer Colonel Thursdays, then the history of the wild west might have been written in much less blood.",

    "review/summary": "Ambiguous Western classic",
    "review/text": "This is one of the three movies in the Cavalry Trilogy, directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne. The others: \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" and \"Rio Grande.\" Each is a classic in its own way. Some say that \"Fort Apache\" is the best of these. While I'm not sure that I would agree, it is a compelling movie. There is considerable ambiguity to it, which makes this a more complex Western than many in its genre.First, the cast contains many in the stock company of Ford actors. The two central characters are Captain York (played by John Wayne) and Colonel Thursday (Henry Fonda). There are hints of Custer in the Thursday character, but that is too simplistic. Other actors of note: John Agar as the suitor to Shirley Temple (playing Thursday's daughter Philadelphia). Victor McLaglen playing (could you guess) an Irish sergeant. Just so, Ward Bond.Second, there is the locale. This is spectacularly filmed in Monument Valley, one of Ford's favorite venues for his Westerns. While the movie is filmed in black and white, I think that it may have more weight as a result. There is a grittiness here that fits the darker themes of the movie.Third, we see life portrayed in a Western fort after the Civil War. There are moments of cheer (the ball); there are moments of misery (long cavalry rides); there are moments of class divisions (Thursday cannot bear that his daughter is in love with a sergeant's son).Fourth, we see two very different visions for officers. York sees the evil inflicted upon Indians. While Thursday understands and has some sympathy for the native Americans, he also seeks a glorious victory. His better angel is sometimes compromised by the thirst for glory. Fonda is a hardnosed disciplinarian, by the book and this creates tensions with other officers and troops.All in all, this is a classic Western, and shows that this genre can produce some fine work if it moves away from stereotypes and tired plot lines. I never tire of watching the movies in the trilogy (and related movies such as \"Hondo\").",

Ford crafts an entertaining movie-watching experience that includes some deft comedic scenes early on. Ward Bond turns in a strong performance as the burly Irish-American Sgt. Major.Ford also defies some of our stereotypes of the classic Western. Owen Thursday, the embittered new leader of Fort Apache brilliantly played by Henry Fonda, is, despite his protestation to the contrary, a martinet and in the end a recklessly proud fool. Perhaps most interesting, Ford starkly calls into question the creation of military heroes. Thursday rides to his death in an unprovoked and fool-hardy frontal attack on Apache warriors. Cut to the closing scene, months later back at the fort, Thursday's memory is lauded by a group of uninformed reporters as a glorious hero to which John Wayne, the new leader of Fort Apache ironically accedes.Highly recommended.",

    "review/text": "In portraying the history of the United States from the Revolutionary War to World War II, John Ford continually resorted to a deeply personal, nostalgic form of legend... If there is no doubt of his importance to the development of the Western, his uniquely sentimental, poetic glorification of the white American's conquest of the wilderness is both picturesque and reactionary...The cavalrymen get a more honorable deal from three films made in succession by him: 'Ford Apache,' 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,' and 'Rio Grande.' These are quite properly referred to as his 'cavalry trilogy' as they deserve to be considered as a body of work dedicated to a particular theme, that of the life of the cavalry and their role as frontier protectors in times of Indian uprising...'Fort Apache' is about the tensions in an isolated fort-social and military - hierarchy tensions, and, ultimately, the purely military tensions that arise when the commanding officer is transparently ill-fitted for his command...Henry Fonda is a vain, domineering, and embittered colonel who can't get over losing his Civil War rank as general... He arrives at the Arizona desert outpost to take over from the experienced Indian fighter, John Wayne... He is arrogant, accepting no advice, and further alienates the hard-bitten veterans by refusing to support the romance of his lovely daughter (Shirley Temple) with a young lieutenant from West Point (John Agar) who happens to be the son of sergeant major (Ward Bond).There are nice touches in the film here about army traditions, and undisciplined troops: Civil War veterans living in noisy harmony; amusing and touching moments with variety of vignettes that deal with the everyday lives of Fort Apache cavalrymen; and pretty Irish drunk humor from Victor McLaglen... The inevitable climax concerns, of course, the colonel's arrogance and ignorance leading his men into an Apache massacre...Ford consistently finds the most beautiful way to frame a scene, and the black and white photography is stunning... But the best of the trilogy is undoubtedly 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,' which remains for many their favorite Western movie...",

    "review/text": "Back in my Army days (\"When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth\") it was a common belief among many, if not most, of us laboring for the cause in green fatigues, that every \"shavetail\" 2nd lieutenant who ever put a pair of gold bars on his shoulders or an \"L.T.\" clip on his collar, should be required to watch John Ford's \"Fort Apache\" before he drew his first duty assignment...and should be also required to write an essay on what it meant. Same thing, we all consensed, should apply to every officer being promoted to a higher rank, right on up the scale. The reason for this, we felt, was that everyone \"moving up\" needed to always be reminded that \"The Book\" (i.e. military regs, tactics, etc.) was only truly workable as a GENERAL GUIDEand was not a foolproof blueprint for micro-managing warfare (or LIFE) on a day by day basis. All too often, obsessively going \"by the book\"...and ignoring all contrary circumstances around you...will land you in a \"heap o' trouble\".And this by-the-book (or \"Company S.O.P.\") \"mania\" is a nuisance factor that often bedevils people to this very day in all walks of life---from hospital staffs to office staffs to restaurant workers to all manner of others---where \"the book\" both intervenes and interferes with a practical \"real world\" effort at \"getting the job done\". All to often 'the book\" iscompiled by \"executive\" types who have nothing better to do than sit around and make up silly, unrealistic, and impractical rules and regulations (most of them...with regard to consequential \"spill-over effects\"...not very well thought out at all) that OTHER people have to TRY and make workable.\"Fort Apache\" tells the story of a \"Book Soldier\", Henry Fonda's \"Col. Owen Thursday\", a by-the-numbers martinet who has come to the Arizona frontier with his head full of Von Clausewitz, Sun Tsu, Alexander and Bonaparte , and West Pointconcepts of \"pinchers\" and \"envelopments\". He is an arrogant elitist who views American Indians as crude, unsophisticated savages and who eyes their capabilities as fighting men withscorn and dismissive disregard.John Wayne plays \"Captain Kirby York\", Fort Apache's executive officer behind Fonda, and the leader of a cadre of veteran officers and NCOs who KNOW the territory and KNOW their adversaries, the Apaches....know them WELL ENOUGH, in fact, toRESPECT them. AND to account for their strengths and capabilities in dealing with them.All this knowledge and \"feel\" for the Apaches means nothing to Thursday when he comes swaggering in, and he takes no time in letting everyone know everything will henceforth be done HIS way. The garrison is troubled and uneasy about \"His\" way, but they have no option but to follow his lead. He IS the colonel.York tries to reason with Thursday but gets nowhere. He even gets used most egregiously (and dishonorably) by Thursday in luring the legendary Cochise over the border from Mexico into U.S. territory. There seems to be no ploy the arrogant colonel won't use in his quest for promotion and prestige within the army.Thursday gets HIS comeuppence in the end...but, unfortunately, he makes a lot of other GOOD men pay the ultimate price for his own incompetence and ineptitude along with him. In many ways the Thursday character is a bit of a take-off on George Custer, although Thursday's demise is based more on the Fetterman Massacre of 1866 rather than on Little Big Horn.Ford's direction is sure-handed in this, and the performances of John Wayne and Henry Fonda are superb. The black & white cinematography is excellent and the jaunty use of 19th century cavalry music...particularly \"The Girl I Left Behind Me\"...is enough to get one's head nodding and toes tapping whenever the band stikes up. \"Fort Apache\" may be, overall, the best of the famous \"Cavalry Trilogy\" , with \"She Wore A Yellow Ribbon\" coming in a VERY close second behind it. \"Rio Grande\" is not a klunker, either, by a long shot...but doesn't really have the sheer power of the first two. And the only reason this trilogy is not a \"Quartet\" is that \"The Horse Soldiers\" is a \"Southern\", rather than a \"western\", and no Indians are involved in it.(And, note: if you like this rip-roaring cavalry stuff, you also need to check out Errol Flynn's \"They Died With Their Boots On\" and \"Santa Fe Trail\").\"Fort Apache\" should have been DVD-available much earlier than now, but it IS here at last, so lets all enjoy this marvelous piece of Americana.",

    "review/text": "Colorization on the Ford/Wayne western videotapes is mostly pastels and lacks detail, with true reds missing. All horses are the same brown color, and fire is a fakey orange hue. Detractors of computer enhancement have much ammunition with these early color-enhanced works.Ward Bond fans will love FORT APACHE. Here, he's Sgt. Maj. O'Rourke, and has the lilting brogue to prove it. During \"the late unpleasantness,\" O'Rourke was a major decorated with the Medal of Honor. This allowed his son a presidential appointment to West Point.Young 2nd Lt. O'Rourke (Agar, in his screen debut) is a spit-shine officer who contrasts with everyone at his current garrison except new commander Lt. Col. Thursday, a former general and an unpleasant by-the-book martinet. Lt. O'Rourke falls in love with the colonel's daughter, but the father doesn't want under-age Philadelphia (Temple) to mix with O'Rourke, so he plans to ship her back East.That storyline is set aside for Thursday's quest after personal glory via a foolhardy attempt to destroy Cochise's Apaches once he's lured them to this side of the Mexican border. A deadly cavalry/warrior clash is the heart of this classic movie.Shot partly in Monument Valley and a loose take on Custer's Last Stand, \"Fort Apache\" was the first of John Ford's \"Cavalry Trio,\" being closely followed by SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON (1949) (VHS) (DVD), and RIO GRANDE (1950) (VHS) (DVD).

    "review/text": "This Fordian classic is one-third of the \"Cavalry Trilogy\" and the only one that focuses on a character other than the one played by John Wayne. Around 1876, Lt.-Col. Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda), following a generalship in the Civil War and several years in Europe, arrives in the Arizona Territory with his 16-year-old daughter Philadelphia (Shirley Temple) to take up the duties of C.O. at Fort Apache, which has been temporarily under Capt. Kirby York (Wayne), with the older Capt. Sam Collingwood (George O'Brien), with whom Thursday has a history, as his adjutant. Also newly come--or perhaps more accurately newly returned, since he grew up there--to Fort Apache is the new-minted Lt. Michael O'Rourke (John Agar), son of the post's sergeant-major (Ward Bond), a 15-year veteran who started out as an officer in an Irish regiment during the War. Phil Thursday and young Michael almost immediately fall in love, while Thursday attempts to impose his particular style of command on his men--and on the Apaches, led by Cochise (Miguel Inclan), whom he tricks into returning from Mexico by using York and the chief's trust of him as a stalking horse. What results is tragedy for almost everyone concerned.Thursday is a paradoxical character: he claims he isn't a martinet, but he behaves like one, especially with regard to his daughter's romance; he confronts the corrupt Agent for the Apaches, Silas Meacham (Grant Withers), then loses all sympathy and respect for the Indians before he even meets them face-to-face; he's arrogant, yet courageous to the point of sacrificing his own life to fulfill what he considers his duty--and he can dance a very respectable polka, too! Fonda, who ordinarily specialized in more sympathetic roles, deserves commendation for managing to bring to life a character so unlike his usual. Like most Westerns of its era, this film plays rather fast and loose with history: no Secretary of War with the name Thursday mentions ever really existed; Cochise did war against the Americans for a good dozen years, but once a treaty had been made with him he never broke out again, and he died quietly on his reservation in 1874. Yet it does accurately point out that much Indian trouble could have been avoided if the agents hadn't been almost universally crooks; and its picture of everyday life on a remote Army post--the training of recruits, the formal behavior of the miniature society that grew up in these situations, the mutual-assistance society formed by the wives of officers and noncoms alike--is splendid. A high point is the \"Sergeants Four,\" Quincannon (Dick Foran), Shattuck (Jack Pennick), hard-drinking Tipperary native Festus Mulcahy (Ford stalwart Victor McLaglen), and the half-Mexican, former-Confederate-officer Beaufort (Pedro Armendariz), who provide both comic relief and a thumbnail sketch of what Indian-fighting noncoms must have been like. And, of course, the stark, striking Monument Valley scenery, though not as impressive in black and white as it would be in color, is a plus. Through it all John Wayne provides a pivot-post around which everything revolves--a stabilizing influence with a practical understanding of Apache ways and tactics and a strong sense of his own obligations and honor, who ends, deservedly, by commanding the regiment. This is definitely one of the best of the many Ford/Wayne teamups and should be in the collection of anyone who likes the work of these two stalwarts.",

    "review/text": "John Ford's Cavalry Trilogy is a series of three movies, \"Fort Apache\" BW (1948), \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" Color (1949) and \"Rio Grande\" BW (1950) in which we get an insight into the life and manners of the United States Cavalry during the Indian Wars. Each is an independent movie and made be viewed in any order.\"Fort Apache\" is the story of a martinet Lt. Col., Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda). Bitter and angry at being shunted aside by the War Department he is determined regain his lost prestige by browbeating so called \"Digger Indians\" (the Apaches of the 1870-74). Posted to Ft Apache, he and his daughter, Philadelphia (Shirley Temple) come up against a well settled army post which has its own established and sensible way of doing things under the leadership of senior troop commander Capt. Kirby York (John Wayne). Brushing aside well seasoned advice, Thursday seeks immediately to remake the command in his personal image while attempting to severely punish the Indians.What makes this film interesting is not the story line but the underlying view of army life and customs of a frontier post. The movie fully explores the ridged caste system that existed between officer and NCO, the social hierarchy even among women, and the bigoted racism against the Indians and the Irish soldiers who made up the core of the professional NCO class. Traditions and customs abound in this movie and duty, tradition and honor to the cavalry are all that matter. Even the music has its tradition, for when the dance is terminated by Lt. Col. Thursday we hear the playing of \"Good Night Ladies\" which was traditional closing song for military dances.One historical note of interest is Shirley Temple's character Philadelphia and her romantic interest in a young lieutenant, Michael O'Rourke (John Agar). This theme will be visited again in the movie \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" where Olivia Dandridge (Joanne Dru) seeks to choose between two young lieutenants, Ross Pennell (Harry Carey Jr.) and Flint Cohill (John Agar). What is notable about these encounters is the age of the girls. Philadelphia we are told is 16 (Shirley Temple was actually 20 at the time) while Olivia Dandridge appears much older (Joanne Dru was 27 at the time). In truth, the journals and the diaries of the times tell us that a single young woman of 16 or more, on the frontier, would have been considered \"Left on the Shelf / An Old Maid\", but the social mores of the mid 20th century and politically correct Hollywood would have not permitted us knowing their true age, which probably would have been about 14-15, but such a portrayal on screen would be unthinkable. With these things in mind, watch for these underlying currents of duty, tradition, and honor running through the movie. \"Ft. Apache\" gives us a nice inside look army life and manners.For those movie history buffs you will be interested to know that this is a pivotal point for director John Ford. Till this point his principal leading man was generally Henry Fonda and is so in this movie. But from this point on John Wayne, playing a secondary role here, will be the rising star and replaces Fonda as Ford's principal leading man.Readers of this review are invited to comment below or by email as listed in my profile.",

    "review/text": "Overall, Fort Apache is a good western. It includes several of the elements required of a Western - good cast with Henry Fonda and John Wayne as the leads, wonderful scenery, and a decent plot. Henry Ford does an excellent job in his role as the new Commander who drives everyone crazy with his staunch leadership style. John Wayne is always great as a Cavalry Officer, and the supporting cast is pretty good as well. John Ford, the great Western Director, does a nice job filming with great landscapes. I enjoyed the movie, but have two main problems with it. First, it does not have enough action. Too much time is spent focusing on life on the base, and not enough of the plot is focused on life in the field for the Calvary. Second, it is a little too long. Otherwise, Fort Apache is a fine Western worth watching.",

    "review/text": "If you want to see Henry Fonda play the stiffest, grouchiest, most conceited, most pigheaded, most vainglorious, most embittered, most foolish military commander you can imagine, this is the right film.With all these negatives, a watchable film is going too require a good deal of counterbalancing humor, song and female presence. John Ford duly provided such aplenty in the form of the cultural contrasts between the formal New Englander, Colonel Thursday(Fonda) and the rough and ready westerners inside and outside of the post he has come to command. Seems the ranks of the NCOs at this post are mostly filled with fun-loving Irishmen. Thursday's beautiful teen daughter, Philadelphia(Shirley Temple), provides an easy entry into the feminine presence in the fort.A new West Point graduate, Lt. O'Rourke, also the son of resident Sergeant O'Rourke, happens to be arriving at the fort the same day as the Thursdays. The Colonel is very chagrined to find an escort waiting for Lt. O'Rourke, but not for himself! He's also chagrined to find that the party in progress when he arrives is not in his honor, but is a birthday party. \"Whose birthday?\" he asks menacingly. \"General George Washington's\", was the satisfactory answer. Thursday keeps addressing Lt. O'Rourke by various misnomers, suggesting he regards him so little that his name isn't worth remembering. Once he finds out that his daughter has designs on O'Rourke, he can finally remember his name! When Thursday is introduced to the former post commander, unbelievably, he declines to meet the extended hand of his predecessor!This is the only film in which Ford's two favorite leading men, Fonda and Wayne, star together, usually as antagonists on how to properly deal with the Apaches. Wayne, as Cpt. York, is knowedgeable and respective of the Apache's ways, while Thursday refuses to learn from the experience of York nor to respect the military prowess and agreements of the Apaches. He does, however, come to share the general disgust with the appointed \"indian\" agent, whose self-serving policies have led some of the Apaches to abandon the reservation in favor of Mexico and others to kill some soldiers on details.Anthony Mann later directed a film \"The Last Frontier\", in which the theme of an arrogant greenhorn commander from the East who refuses to heed the advice of those used to the local Native Americans, is repeated. Although not as well balanced as the present film, it's worth checking out. In both films, the offending commander has to be eliminated in order to allow a budding romance involving a woman dear to his heart to proceed to completion.In my opinion, this is the most enjoyable western Ford(and perhaps anyone else) directed, in spite of Colonel Thursday's difficult personality and the absence of either Walter Brennan or Gabby Hayes(neither on Ford's list of essential supporting actors). It's my guess the name Thursday was meant to have some symbolic significance. Thursday is, of course, named in honor of the Norse and Germanic god of thunder and war, protector of gods and humans from danger.Shirley Temple seems a tad stiff in her role. Perhaps this was intended as a consequence of a finishing school experience. She seems to be playing a girl of about 16, a few years younger than her actual age, who easily pouts when her clear romantic interest in a man is not immediately returned. John Agar, who plays her romantic interest, was in fact her husband at the time, but not for long. I was struck how much her face at this age resembled that of a young Jane Mansfield.",

It's a deft combination of real science and emotional interplay, set during a time when humanity has FINALLY taken the first real steps into the solar system, building a colony on the moon and discovering a wanderlust that will push ever outward. First, though, there's a mountain of trash to be cleared out of Earth's orbit; literally millions of tiny (and not so tiny) bits of debris travelling faster than bullets that can punch clean through a spaceship. The main characters in Planetes are at the bottom of the sociology of the time, yet they perform the most important service imaginable: they're trash collectors. Through their eyes we witness the social and political paradigm shifts that are being caused by access to this new frontier. Some nations are at the forefront, others are being left behind. The series leaves nothing out, often mixing the big picture with the most intimate and touching moments I've seen in any anime series in a long time.Long story short: if you're a hard science-fiction fan with an eye toward realism, this is the anime you've been waiting for (I often get the feeling that if Arther C. Clarke were to write a series, it would turn out pretty much like this one). If you're an anime fan, here's one of the best examples of the medium you can find. 26 episodes, infinite enjoyment.(And while you're at it, you'll want to read the manga of the same name.

Kirk Thornton, Julie Ann Taylor, Wendee Lee, Jamieson Price, Steve Jay Blum, Tony Oliver, Crispin Freeman, Lex Lang, Steve Kramer and much, much more.The second disc has interviews with Tony Oliver (who is also the English ADR director), Kirk Thornton and Julie Ann Taylor, as well as members of NASA's REAL Orbital Debris Department! There is also a photo gallery showing real debris that has fallen back to Earth, audio dramas in Japanese and the normal trailers you find on a anime disc.This special edition is truely special and does not cost you an arm and a leg. A must for any fan of anime, sci-fi, Wendee Lee (YEAH) or anybody who enjoys a good, solid story!",

    "review/summary": "The Best Series of the Year",
    "review/text": "No doubt about it, 2005 was a good year for anime. In the same year we got Galaxy Railways, Samurai 7, and this awesome gem. If you boil it down to it's basic components, Planetes about the lives of people in the not-so-distant future who work in outer space collecting garbage from the Earth's orbit (the literal translation of the Greek word Planetes is \"Wanderers\"). In actuality, this show is so much more it's very difficult to describe. You could say it's more like a traditional television show (or even documentary television) than most anime (no fan-service, giant robots, exaggerated body types, over-the-top action, ect). It's so grounded in reality that you could be forgiven for wondering why you would even want to animate it in the first place. The characters are ordinary people, their working environment is very realistic, much of the drama comes from the personal struggles of the characters, and there is NO sound in space. Furthermore, under the the tight direction, superb dialog, exquisite characterization, detailed artwork and smooth animation, you will find the soul of outer space arguably not glimpsed since a certain Gainax classic.If I were to try to describe the spirit of this show, I would say it is very like the legendary Wings of Honneamise. In both that film and this series, we are presented with a world that has lost it's idealism, its hopes and dreams, and is being swallowed up by greed, laziness, and self-interest. Like that universe, here it is shown repeatedly that despite the cold, unfeeling, uncaring world, there are always little ways that the true beauty of humanity (and indeed, the universe) can shine through. If this show has a motto, it's gotta be something like \"There's a big, scary, cruel world out there... but I don't believe in it.\"This romantic idealism is personified by the kind female protagonist, Ai Tanabe. Introduced in the first episode and one of the two main characters from there on out, Ai is one of the greatest, to say nothing of most human anime characters I have yet witnessed. At once timid, shy, sweet, tough, strong, and righteously motivated, her character makes a perfect foil (perfect match?) for the rough and cynical Hachimachi (the headband wearing wannabe). The true genius of their relationship is, of course, that despite the fact that Hachi is always acting like a person totally grounded in reality who only cares about himself, he actually has dreams, ideals, and deep feelings that he hides deep down. In other words, he's just like her.There are many other characters, and all of them save one or two receive considerable character development time in this series. In the beginning and middle of the series, there are entire episodes devoted just to the back story of a single character. And of course, despite the realistic setting, we see again and again what might be called miracles by the true believers and amazing coincidences by the unmoved.Through the course of the show we get to see some wonderful drama, greatly enhanced by the use of the silence of space and some very appropriate music. Again, the realism of the series serves to further strengthen things, as we find ourselves thinking of the characters as real people, and feeling their deep inner struggles.If I had to describe the animation style of this show, I'd say it looked somewhat like the style of The Cat Returns. Everything has a somewhat pastel coloration, people and buildings look detailed, but somewhat sketchy (as opposed to the sharp angles or overly round looks most are familiar with). The spaceships, machinery, and other fine points are meticulously detailed, and CGI is used carefully and sparingly (again, only enhancing the presentation).If there are any downsides to this excellent show, they would probably be either the comedy (which I personally love, but some people find too bizarre), the somewhat awkward beginning of the first episodes, and perhaps the ending theme (it just doesn't seem to go with the epic feel as well as the opening theme which I absolutely love).Everyone who is a fan of serious science fiction, drama, or just plain old good anime or good TV shows in general needs to watch this series. I was hooked from the first time I saw the intro with the first rocket ships taking off, and knew it was a classic when the final episodes had me in tears. This one gets my highest recommendation.",

It was almost like watching a movie not a TV show! And the way the background music and scenery come together was extremely beautiful to watch. Secondly, I was impressed by how the creators managed to make such a dull sounding storyline so interesting to watch. There is much excitement and danger to be found in the debris collector job and the creators have managed to successfully convey the importance of the task from the start. This is a highly enjoyable anime series for mature audiences who can sit back and enjoy a good story without magical creatures and robot transformations. One minor quibble I would have is the fact that some of the characters are too darn cliche. But other than that, Planetes looks to be shaping up to be one of the quality animes being released at this time.",

Ai Tanabe is a young lady who has come to space to collect and dispose of this dangerous debris. She meets veteran debris collector, Hoshino. Together with their friends, they keep space travelers and residents safe. As time goes by, the 2 fall in love with each other. It's harder to do a dangerous job with the one you love waiting and praying for your safety.This anime is really good. It has action, drama, comedy, Sci-fi/adventure, and a bit of romance. It's pretty stacked. The animation and voice actors are good as well. I'm really surprised that this anime isn't more well known. The 1 thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is the depth of the story. The story backgrounds the characters well, but there is a little too much wasted time on goofiness I think. If that time were used to develop the romance between Ai and Hoshino more, This series could have been incredible. This series does have a very satisfying ending though. Overall, this anime is a joy to watch. I highly recommend it to anime fans of any genre.",

My day job is to limit orbital debris creation from NASA satellites, so any series that recognizes the importance of my daily struggle is an automatic win with me.That said, I think the show is interesting, and something I could see watching on Saturday mornings for fun. They've included enough interpersonal relationship stuff to keep it interesting, but with the backdrop of nerdy space facts. I love to destroy these kinds of shows on technical inaccuracies, but I find that harder to do with this series. The writers seem to have made the effort to actually research their topic a little bit, and tried to stick to facts. There are a few inventions to fit the story lines, but for the most part they try to be reasonably accurate.The interviews in the bonus tracks are pretty good, and I use them in my classes on orbital debris.",

They whine and scream more often than not, and the comic relief is painfully uncomfortable. The main character... a young, new recruit... is a noise machine. If she's not screwing up, she's pontificating and just won't shut up. The even bigger problem with that is she's not the loudest of the bunch. Her spineless bosses are absolutely imbecilic and unlikable on every level.I'm all for human stories, but I didn't pick this title up to see men sing and dance in their underwear with the hopes of winning the lottery.

    "review/text": "The topic of trains is one of great interest despite the poor state of US railroads with the legend and the logic of railroads is a permanent part of US history. What would DC be without the Metro or Chicago without the 'L\"? This series while well intended and at times interesting is nothing if not reminiscent of the faux sports competition of various Gordon Ramsey kitchen projects or the numerous team sports on the Food Channel. The most positive to be said about the presenter is that at least he is confined to Maine and will not be sitting next to me on a flight.The topic has great potential but its presentation as \"We've got to get this train of produce to Schenectady by x hours\" as if the train were not running on a 365/24/7 schedule is inane - as if \"We\" including the presenter were a help and not a hinderance. A richness of subject matter and scenery is subsumed by moronic chit chat (or is that chit chat by a moron?) and superficiality. Amtrak's Acela is not even close to being among the world's fastest (or reliable) trains given the poor infrastructure, the freight trains are par for the course with France and Germany equal in every respect except the latter don't derail as often. The program ignores the rich history of the stations (hey let's go to the rodeo in Cheyenne instead!!), the scenery, the fascinating history and technology of the infrastructure support (yes there is some but the commentary is by the idiot commentator - \"isn't this great\" not by the experts who as one reviewer noted appear to either cringe or ignore Mr. Matt). the future role of the railroad in the US - if the funding doesn't end up with the vampire squids in NYC etc. etc. Imagine the BBC or PBS doing this series - it would be sublime. There's still room.",

For example, the engineering and hard work it was to build the roadbeds for the trains over mountain passes even before many of the roads were built. Some of the routes followed rivers or covered wagon trails. This video series sure beats a lot of the programming coming to my TV.

His face fills the screen constantly, with quick cuts to different train operations. I saw a lot of quick glimpses into how things are done, but would have really enjoyed longer, more detailed shots of the hardware and shorter shots of the host. One thing for sure, I know what the host looks like while riding and working around trains. I'm certainly no expert, but I did hear one bit of information about train line brakes that was backwards (applying air to the train brake line applies the brakes, which it doesn't). Later on in another segment the host seems to get the correct script and mentions the actual way train brakes work. There's some interesting shots in a major locomotive repair facility, and in the railroad control center. Just be ready to see the technical stuff once the host moves his face out of the way. Did we get to see how a locomotive is started? No. Why they are rarely shut down? No. Close-up shots of the instrument panel, especially the ones with computer screens? No. All in all it's enjoyable and worth the price. But the camera crew was RIGHT THERE! They could have captured so much more, but missed it. If you're not interested in the technical stuff, than you'll probably be 100% satisfied. Otherwise, get ready to join the host close up and ride the rails (while looking over his shoulder).",

The host is not a good narrator or storyteller, and the video gimmicks get old in a hurry.The core information in each one is interesting to both railfans and casual viewers alike, but the script repeats nearly everything more than once in an effort to fill the time allotted, and the host often resorts to silly or stupid questions and weak humor to try to justify his existence. In one particular episode I wondered if the engineer and conductor were contemplating tossing him off the train to be rid of the annoyance.If the producers had recognized these episodes don't need an hour, and that the host's style is more suited to a young children's show, they could have put out a much better product with 30 minute episodes and a host who knows how to talk to adults.Given the price - $10.49 as of March 17, 2012 - go ahead and buy it if you're interested. As long as you can ignore the host's shortcomings and have a fast-forward on your DVD player you'll be able to enjoy the good parts. If I could find a way to edit them, I'd cut the episodes down to the enjoyable segments and actually watch them from time to time. Lacking that ability and/or the time to do it, I'm satsified enough having seen this on TV that I don't plan to buy this DVD set.",

What I liked about this show was that it took the viewer behind the scenes, and put the trains in context of something bigger. And they have a good selection, including \"steamies\" and the Acela express that travels from Washington DC to Boston. There's even a circus train.If you or your kid like trains, this is a great buy.

Disintegration from self-indulgence. This is a difficult film to sit through, and, frankly, I admit to fast-forwarding it frequently. I've tried to watch it non-stop all the way, two or three times, but I don't think I've succeeded, although I've picked up most of the material by piecing it together in retrospect. It must be almost universally true that untouched improvisation properly never works. Art MUST consider the spectator. Actors, performers, are in the entertainment business: they that live to please should please to live. But, fairly early in their lives, Orson, Elvis and Marlon didn't care enough about the audience --- although Elvis did what he was told, of course. This film is a kind of monument to Marlon's love of seeing himself suffer, and seeking an identity for himself. Other people don't matter that much.",

    "review/summary": "A real experience that only works once.",
    "review/text": "In 'Last Tango In Paris', Marlon Brando gives a performance that renders superlatives and previous notions about acting redundant. In fact, replace the bland phrase 'gives a performance' with 'gropes' or 'bleeds'. The film is at its best when content to simply follow Brando, his silent screams of anguish, his profane riffing, his bizarre improvisations, his anecdotal rambles and jazzy clowning, his desire and despair, his laughter and violence. The most celebrated example of this is in a one-sided dialogue with his dead wife, quite but brutal sneers and obscenities collapsing into a terrifying grief, lonelines, incomprehension, need, loss. The not uncomic juxtaposition of this emotional torrent, and its insentient, beflowered, mummified recipient adds a grotesqueness that only underlines the scene's power. The film's brilliant coda, like a 70s cop show directed by de Sade, in which bathos and pathos are indistinguishable, is driven by Brando's reckless bravura (that English accent!) and inspired control. Laugh? Cry? I nearly shot myself.A first viewing of 'Last Tango' can be one of the most gruelling and shattering experiences in the cinema, and one can completely understand why Pauline Kael flipped for it. But this first viewing operates on an obscurantist level that scrapes the senses and emotions, but bypasses the mind. You get caught up in everything that colours Brando's soulbaring - the grimy Francis Bacon aesthetic, with its ugly, predominantly brown monochrome mise-en-scene; the murky, claustrophobic interiors; the dismally ironic splashes of colour in blood red; the circus-ring arena in which the sexual affair between Paul, an American exile whose rich wife has just killed herself, and the young bourgeois Jeanne, daughter of a late, high-ranking military-officer, is played out, complete with poses, props, colours and creases from Bacon paintings that are supposed to express internal traumas. The title dance and the initial set-up - widower tries to find escape in anonymous sex - inextricably links sex and death, and determines a compositional style contesting absence and presence, darkness and light; as well as the atmosphere of sterility, depletion, disintegration and decadence that hangs over the film like a fashionable painting.Subsequent viewings reveal how far the director betrays his star. It's as if there are two movies - the psychodrama Brando is intuitively feeling out, shot in tight, inescapable, long-take close-ups; and an arty intellectual exercise that flaunts its own technique and theoretical interests - the obsession with mirrors, reflections and shards to fragment the body; the doubling of characters; the psychological framework; the Godardian use of slushy music and composition as alienation effects; the sub-plot tripe involving Jeanne and her film-maker fiancee, with all its ideas about 'representation', 'the body', 'subjectivity' blah blah; the Marxist infusion of class and race etc. This intellectual guff is like a prison from which Brando's flayed spirit tries to escape, just as the decor (more enterprisingly) is forever blocking characters from each other. The tension makes for a fascinating movie - although the misogynistic scene in which a gummy granny putting her false teeth watched by the ripe young mini-skirted Jeanne, whose body the camera eyes up and down, unfortunately sets the tone - but for Bertolucci, the irreversible rot starts here.",

I have heard all the critics talk about Brando's signiture rolls namely as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire, Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, and Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather as his top performances. Of coarse they are all amaming, I own all three films and have watched them many times, but somehow Last Tango gets left out. Not all the time but most of it. In Paul, under Berolucci's direction, I think Brando created his most amazing and difficult performance. Most people wouldn't agree, but people who have really studied the actor as I have might. This movie is not so much about the characters in it or the simple plot that it follows, it is about Brando himself. Perhaps no other actor in history has fascinated people with his amazing talent only to have to watch him throw it away on low bugget films and cameo performances for big bucks. !I believe this is Brando's greatest performance because it is Brando. Watch him, listen to him, Paul is Brando. I think the defining moment for me was when he says to Maria Schnieder \"I been called by a thousand names, I would be better off being call by a grunt or a groan.\" Likewise at the end of the film after he has been shot Schneider says \"he was a stranger, I didn't even know his name.\" To me this is how the world perceives Brando himself. What do we really know about him? Everything or nothing. Brando to the public is like Paul to Schneider's character, he is an enigma. And he will stay that way. Brando has given some of the finest performances ever printed on film, but they were performances all the same. In Last Tango in Paris Brando stripped the method act and gave us the man. It is truely an amazing thing to see. After this film Brando did not perform for three years, and when he did start acting again it was only for the pay. I think this is because in Last Tango B!rando layed it all out and that was it for him.",

I think it's a shame to see the reviews given by close minded people or people who just didn't open up to the film and the characters.

    "review/text": "Few films are as remarkable as \"Last Tango In Paris\" (1972) for having achieved so little with the immense possibilities of its concept, director, production crew and cast, or its romantic location--Paris.Pauline Kael surely blushes at the pull quote attributed to her on the DVD case, \"The most powerfully erotic movie ever made!\". To be sure, we see that the gamin young Maria Schneider is a fine figure of a woman, but her character, Jeanne, portrays the kind of femininity mythologised in machismo--a preparedness, even a desire, to be sexually humiliated, unmitigated even by the emphatic terms on which the relationship ends. The word \"love\" is used, here and there, in extraordinarily barren circumstances. Paul (Marlon Brando's character) mumbles through the film with a degree of self-absorption approaching autism. There are widely separated good scenes, such as the tango competition. The dialogue hardly ever gets better than Paul saying, \"I have a prostate like an Idaho potato, but I'm still a good stick man\".The claim of the film to have been \"the most controversial film of its era\" (fewer blushes, perhaps, for Leonard Maltin) rests not so much on its explicitness, but its emotional shallowness combined with uses of butter which could never be embraced by the dairy industry.So why see this film at all? Perhaps, to see how even a great chef, with excellent ingredients, may sometimes produce a flopped souffl&eacute;. To consider the question, \"What is (not) erotica?\". To study the career of Marlon Brando. Also, perhaps, to examine our own emotional development and to feel good comparatively about ourselves. Almost anyone will have deeper understanding and experience of love, or obsession, between men and women than is displayed here.For classy erotica, look elsewhere. Many better and more erotic and romantic films are based on similar themes of troubled characters in cross-cultural sexual obsession--such as Wayne Wang's \"Chinese Box\" (1997). As for making good use of Paris, check out Stanley Donen's \"Charade\" (1963), with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, which is erotic only by suggestion, as well as having a sparkling and funny script, and enjoyable over-acting.Director Bernardo Bertolucci is far better than \"Last Tango\". So, even he has made a far better film about cross-cultural sexual obsession. He returns to the theme in his 1999 film, \"Besieged\". This makes wonderful use of one of the most photogenic and stagelike settings in Rome, the Spanish Steps and the Piazza di Spagna. \"Besieged\" also has more humanity, more complex characterisation, and builds suggestive, musical and explicit eroticism between the characters of Thandie Newton and David Thewlis. In many ways, it seems Bertolucci's atonement for the failings of \"Last Tango\".(This review refers to the widescreen MGM year 2000 DVD reissue of \"Last Tango In Paris\".)Update in December 2011: for information of those who have voted against my low rating of this flopped souffl&eacute;, my assessment is as firm as ever after all these years, and I have no regrets whatsoever that my review does not meet your artistically perverted expectations. My reasons are amplified in attached comments.",

    "review/text": "Marlon Brando's recent death affected me deeply. He has always been one of my favorite actors and I truly admire him for his extraordinary talent. During the last few weeks I have rented many of Brando's films and am still amazed, after all these years, at the force of his acting in \"Last Tango In Paris.\" I believe that some of his best work was done in this film.Paul, (Brando), an aging American expatriate in Paris, comes home to discover that his marriage has ended. His French wife, Rosa, had slit her veins, leaving bloody bath water and spattered walls behind. She didn't leave much else - no good-bye note or explanation for her husband, parents or lover, a guest in the fleabag hotel she owned and managed. She did bequeath the hotel, and it's seedy occupants, to Paul. Overwhelmed with grief, Paul walks the streets and finds himself looking at an apartment for rent. He finds Jeanne, (Maria Schneider), a girl-woman, barely out of her teens, looking at the same apartment. She is to be married in a few weeks to her bourgeois, filmmaker fiancee. Paul and Jeanne circle each other warily in the empty flat, each contemplating the rental, (and each other), and wondering who will take it. Suddenly, they grab each other and have hard, fast sex against the apartment wall. Thus begins a most bizarre relationship.Paul makes the rules. Jeanne must follow them or she will not see him again. Their purely carnal relationship must remain anonymous, emotionless, and exist only within the walls of the apartment, which Paul rents for this purpose. There are to be no sexual taboos between them. He does not want to know her name or anything about her and refuses to give her any information about himself. They are not to see each other outside the apartment confines, nor even leave together. It seems as if Paul wants to bury his pain, his sense of betrayal and hurt in the mindless, sometimes brutal, act of sex. Director Bernardo Bertolucci's camera perfectly captures the impersonal nature of their coupling. The shots are blunt, without sensuality or eroticism, but an enormous sexual energy is captured. I think Jeanne is fascinated by the mystery that is Paul. She is bored, perhaps, and looking for something, maybe excitement. She is certainly intrigued by Paul's dominant role, and seems to enjoy playing the passive partner most of the time. She is clearly not happy with her boyfriend, who relates to her as the object of his latest film. He talks at her, not to her. And he does not listen. However, I do not see Jeanne as merely an object here, as do some others. The film focuses on Paul, not Jeanne.It is unfortunate that Ms. Schneider's career fizzled after this movie. She is excellent as Jeanne and perfectly captures her character's capriciousness, playfulness, bewilderment, vulnerability, anger, frustration, seductiveness and curiosity. Brando is simply superb. There are times, when he and Jeanne are together, that it appears as if he is extemporizing. He acts as if there is no camera filming him - as if he is not acting at all. There is one scene, where he is alone with his wife's body - she is layed-out in a coffin. Brando begins to speak to her and just loses it. His remarkable outpouring of guilt and grief is probably the best acting I have ever seen.Towards the end of the film there is a surreal ballroom scene where couples are dancing the tango. It is both haunting and memorable. The end is a bit of a letdown, but in a Brandoesque moment the actor comes to the rescue.Bertolucci was very effected by the work of painter Frances Bacon, considered to be one of the best artists of the 20th century. He chose Brando after seeing a Bacon painting \"of a man in great despair who had the air of total disillusionment.\" The \"Last Tango In Paris,\" defined as \"the most controversial film of an era,\" brought Bertolucci to international attention. It was nominated for two Academy Awards. Vittorio Storaro's cinematography adds to the cold, remote ambiance. His camera pans the colorless apartment and makes the viewing experience as impersonal as the couple's relationship.This is obviously not a film for everyone. It has been called obscene, and worse. However, there are many, like myself, who think it is a great film. For fans of Marlon Brando, it doesn't get better than this. Bravo!JANA",

Although it is somewhat dated and certainly not for everyone, Last Tango in Paris is a truemasterpiece of filmmaking.Tame by today's standards, it is easy to see why 1972 audiences were shocked by its brutal frankness and full frontal nudity. It is a film about isolation, betrayal and confrontingone's own insecurities.I found the beginning most difficult to believe- middle aged man begins an affair with a beautiful young woman after having mether only moments before in an empty apartment. And then theycontinue to meet for sex even though he insists that they revealnothing about themselves beyond the physical act of sex!Once past this impossible beginning, we begin to learn more aboutthe characters- he is a lonely widower, she is engaged to a youngfilm student. She eventually accepts the fact that their relationship is nothing more than sexual.Maria Schneider is very good in her role as the French girl and she seems completely comfortable with the graphic nude scenes she is in. But it is Brando who commands our complete attention. He dominates every scene and while Schneider spends a great deal of time being naked, he does not yet it is still his character that facinates us.The film gets bogged down in some areas and many viewers may become bored with the scenes that involve some of the supporting characters. But, and trust me on this, DO NOT miss the scene inwhich Brando visits the body of his dead wife. It is not a long scene but it alone is worth the price one will pay for seeing this film- be it in cash and/or time. It is a scene that all students of film and acting should be required to see. Once you have seen it I am sure you will agree- acting does not get any better than this.",

It is mostly Paul who takes the active part, but Jeanne is taking the reality of his lashings as a welcome return to bleak reality from the artificiality of her own personal life and in particular her fiance.When others complain that outside of the scenes circling Brando the story gets thin, I think they miss the intention of the film. It is this stark naked reality of Brando which drives Jeanne into Paul's arms again and again.And which culminates in the climax when Paul falls back from essential cruelty, domination and _life_ into superficiality like everything else.I can't fathom why you'd be wanting to watch this with a romantic interest over a bottle of champagne as somebody else suggested.The film is deeply unsettling unless you are bereft of any sensibility, and then you probably would not want to let your romantic interest to know.I don't think that there is any film into which Brando invested more personal energy and life force than this one.",

I thought to myself back then, \"That didn't look like acting.\" I read his bio and found out that he WASN'T acting. What you're seeing is an emotional breakdown on film: his weeping is just too raw and severe; he broke his hand when he punched a door during the mother-in-law scene (an action not in the script); the farm tales he tells were from his own childhood; and, perhaps most devastating of all, he rages at his dead wife's body in the film--but he's really dredging up his real-life anger for his alcoholic mother.Afterward, he was quoted as saying, \"I'll never act like that again.\" And then went on to do THE GODFATHER.(Another weird detail: Maria Schneider, the young French girl in the film, is the daughter of a former roommate of Brando's.)It may feel \"foreign\" in places to an American audience, but this film's scenes of desire, desperation and despair are universal.",

    "review/text": "The reputation of Bernardo Bertolucci's LAST TANGO IN PARIS precedes it. Film critic Pauline Kael famously proclaimed it to be \"the most powerfully erotic movie ever made\", while the NC-17 rating and a few sour reviews led some to believe that the film was nothing more than high-class pornography. This is one of the greatest tragedies in film history, because, you see, LAST TANGO IN PARIS is one of the very finest films ever made.True, the film does have four or five scenes of sexuality, some of it a little intense, but nowadays it seems rather tame. The NC-17 rating is silly. Were the film released today, I believe it would grab an R. My point is that, contrary to what reviewers, the MPAA, and even the plotline may tell you, this film is not about sex.Marlon Brando plays a 45-year-old American living in Paris. His wife recently committed suicide. At the start of the film, Brando goes for a walk through Paris to escape from the confines of his blood-splattered apartment. He happens to be walking the same path as Jeanne (Maria Schneider), a young Parisian dating a filmmaker. The two unknowingly follow each other, as though commanded by fate, to an apartment building, where an apartment has recently been put up for sale. Jeanne, overjoyed, looks the apartment over - only to find Brando sitting in the corner silently. Their brief encounter ends with the strangers having passionate sex against the wall, beginning a relationship that will have an extraodinary effect on each of their lives. The two strangers decide that they will meet regularly at the apartment, but that their relationship will be based strictly on sex. Brando emphasizes that there will be no names mentioned in their time together; the outside world will simply cease to exist.Brando's character, it turns out, is named Paul. Paul resembles a somewhat kinder Stanley Kowalski from A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. Whether due to his wife's suicide or simply his nature, Paul acts a little eccentricly. He is usually in a good and playful mood around Jeanne, even when - especially when - Jeanne is not. He always manages to cheer her up. However, outside of their apartment, Paul is often angry, clearly on the edge, torn apart inside by his wife's death. I do not exaggerate when I say that no one but Marlon Brando could play this character. Brando puts equal emphasis on both sides of the character, and in typical Brando fashion he BECOMES the character. I would say that, without a doubt, this is one of the very finest - if not THE finest performance - of Brando's entire career.Schneider deserves a lot of credit as well. She does a marvelous job of bringing out the confusion and youthful innocence in the character of Jeanne. Ultimately, we sympathize as much with her - perhaps more so - than we do with Brando's character. Schneider also has some wonderful on-screen chemistry with Brando.Remember when I said that LAST TANGO IN PARIS is not about sex? Well, what it is really about is life and relationships. Through her sexual encounters with Paul, Jeanne becomes closer to him than she does to her own fiance. Paul learns many surprising facts about his wife after her suicide. In what is possibly the film's most moving scene, Paul talks to his wife's body. \"Even if a husband lives 200 f-----g years, he'll never discover his wife's true nature,\" he says. \"I may be able to understand the secrets of the universe, but ... I'll never understand the truth about you.\"I feel that Bernardo Bertolucci, who directed and co-wrote the film with Franco Arcalli, has not received the credit that he deserves. His directing, in particular, is extraodinary. He gets the greatest performances possible from his cast. He knows the perfect angles to shoot the scenes at, which results in some wonderful cinematography from Vittorio Storaro. There are times when LAST TANGO IN PARIS seems like a very cold film, but through every moment it is bursting with life and vitality.Much of the film's vigor comes from Gato Barbieri's magnificent music. It's an utterly beautiful score led by dazzling saxophone solos performed by Barbieri himself. It is entirely without flaw. Barbieri's score is undoubtedly one of the greatest in movie history.My purpose in this review has been to convince you that LAST TANGO IN PARIS is not what it seems. It is such a great pity that the film has become only a minor classic, its reputation made foul by the controversy which emerged after the film's release in 1972. The truth is that LAST TANGO IN PARIS is the reason cinema was invented. It is true art, and in my humble opinion one of the very finest films ever made. Viewing it is a profoundly emotional experience. All I can say to you is to ignore everything you've heard about the film, and to simply watch it. From the opening to the shocking conclusion, LAST TANGO IN PARIS is a true cinematic masterpiece.",

    "review/text": "I first saw this film in a college cinema class. After we watched it, a long discussion ensued, led largely by the feminist-minded females (and males, for that matter), about the number of scenes where Brando was shirtless vs. the number of times Maria Schneider was (mercifully, Brandon kept his Haines on at all times). We talked about how this is a \"male-eyed\" film, about how Schneider's character is never as fully developed, etc., etc. (Frankly, I think a character who can utter the lines \"You treat me like a woahr,\" is pretty well-developed.)Almost 20 years later, I realize there's no way a class of 20-somethings could have appreciated what we were seeing, and thus the true greatness of the film eluded young, high-minded college students more interested in Maria's nipples than in Brando's angst. For not once did any of us talk about the shattering scene where Brando confronts his dead wife. If there's anything from Last Tango In Paris I took with me, it's that, and the amazing acting therein. I really don't care about Schneider's boobs, which honestly aren't all that great anyhow.What makes this film great for me is the structure of an old(er), beaten down cynical man going through grief, who bumps into a young, fresh woman who doesn't really know who she is or why she wants what she wants. Schneider has said that Bertolucci kept her in the dark during much of the filming. One hopes it was to evoke this pure, almost wide-eyed performance from her and not out of any disrespect or cruelty, although Schneider late said she'd never work with him again. Her performance here is effortless. More importantly, there's a chemistry between her and Brando that works. It may seem strange to talk about chemistry in a movie where the male lead rapes and bullies the female lead, but it's there. Watch the scene in the bathroom, where he's shaving, and marvel at the spontaneous-sounding dialogue and the feeling that a real relationship is there.Brando is perfect for his role. The story unfolds slowly (they'd never make a film with this kind of pacing today), and Brando becomes at least somewhat more sympathetic (and complex) as it goes on. This isn't brute Brando but rather complex, deeply wounded Brando who brings out the brute in him only to keep the world at bay. After his catharsis he shows another side of himself, probably a more typical side, to Schneider and she just can't cope--it's hard for me to tell, even after repeated viewings, if it's because she's getting married to someone else (how happy she'll be remains in serious doubt to me), because she's afraid of a three-dimensional Brando who really seems now to want her for more than casual sex, or what. In some ways the ending was arbitrary, but it still struck me as more plausible and organic than similar sudden endings in The Night Porter and The Marriage of Maria Braun.Throughout, Bertolucci shoots most of the interior scenes between Schneider and Brando at sunset. Bathed in orange, they have a stillness and yet an intensity the other scenes lack. It seems orange is the color Bertolucci set aside for deep revelations and realizations. The film is distrubing, but somehow also cathartic. The feeling of wanting to say \"F--- the world\" is one many of us can relate to, something Brando himself did many times in his career.The print is scratched and the soundtrack somewhat tinny. There are numerous times where dirt or fuzz in the gate can be seen on the top or bottom edge of the frame for whole scenes. This is a film that cries out for a full-blown restoration. The DVD contains nothing else but the trailer, and a strange trailer it is. You'd think a DVD of a movie this famous would feature commentaries, documentaries, where-they-are-now type of featurettes, etc. This classic has been short-changed.But *do* many people today see Last Tango In Paris as a classic? This is somehthing I wondered as I read reviews online after seeing the DVD. Heralded as a masterpiece and a turning point in cinema when it was released, it is now clear that it was anything but. Rather than continue with personal films that sometimes disturbed the psyche and questioned the soul of the moviegoer, Hollywood and then other filmmakers turned to empty spectacle as the 70s waned, trading boobs for lightsabers. Last Tango was hailed in 1972 as a beginning of a new cinema, but it was also the end of it. With a few exceptions (The Unbearable Lightness of Being comes quickest to mind) this sort of film would never be made again, and Last Tango has become in some ways anachronistic. Just reading the online reviews, most of them probably written by people in their 20s for whom Terminator 2 is an ancient movie, it becomes clear that we don't really understand this sort of picture anymore, and are made uncomfortable by it. There's no simple line of action. There's no \"plot.\" There are long stretches with no dialogue, or at least where the characters don't tell you in dialogue what they are doing. As television and movies have merged in style, technique and subject matter, Last Tango and other films from the period become more like museum relics than living, breathing cinema.Perhaps that's one reason why we haven't seen a restoration. Unless Criterion gets its hands on this film, I don't have much hopes. Too bad, because Last Tango represents a whole type of filmmaking that's largely unknown today, even to film \"students,\" and if it is known it's becoming more of a curiosity than, as I said, living, breathing cinema. All the more reason to rent this, then, and witness a whole approach to movie-making that no longer exists--certainly not in the USA.",

He starts out by insulting her using the most degrading words possible. He displays his confusion, hopelessness and abandonment and ends with an outpouring of his own unspecified...guilt. There is a moment when we fear that Paul might attempt an act of necrophilia on the dead woman.In his 'relationship' with Jeanne we perhaps learn something of the nature of Paul's guilt. He's a sado-masachist and, Jeanne, despite her beautiful body, is a child. Therefore, there is a strong pedophilic component of the diseased relationship. Jeanne reacts, not as an abused woman, but as an abused child.Paul forces the girl to drink the deepest dregs of sexual humiliation, depravity and degradation. Sex is not for love but for hate....and the more hateful the better. Jeanne, reacting as a child, comes back for more and more and the ending is predictable. The very sick Paul is a sexual psychopath and Jeanne will die, either by her own hand, or by Paul's hand following or during an act of sexual perversion and torture.If there is any question about it, there is the last tango. Jeanne tries to break free but, showing her conflict, performs an act of oral humiliation. She runs but Paul pursues like a cat toying with a helpless mouse. She runs, he runs. She slows, he slows. She flees up an elevator, he keeps pace on the stairs. She escapes into her mother's apartment and Paul breaks in.Now all that is left is for the delicate, beautiful, completely confused Jeanne to die terribly. But noooooo....After watching the film, and appreciating the fine acting, I searched for a redeeming feature of this excruciating and difficult film. I think it's there but am not sure whether the writers, directors and producers of this film realized it. For certain, none of the reviewers here--most of whom seem to have been dazed by Brando's fine acting and the girl, Jeanne's, perfect body--caught it.This is the intimate portrait of a sexual psychopath. Had Paul survived and extracted the last iota of pleasure from Jeanne's degraded corpse, there would have been momentary relief before his next victim...Ron Braithwaite, author of novels of Spanish Conquest of America--'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'",

Truth is, it's also probably the last film where Brando demonstrated why he was considered one of America's best actors. It's most definitely a flawed film. The scenes where Brando does not appear are pretentious and fairly boring. I tend to agree with the assessment of Ingmar Bergman, who opined that the storyline of this film actually would have made more sense if the 2 main characters had been played as gay men. Perhaps. Maria Schneider is very sexy, but she's just not a really good actress. And yet, when Brando is on screen, he's absolutely dynamic, enthralling, electric. Never before, and probably never again, will you witness a performance so raw, so unadorned, so revealing. Forget the sexual scenes that earned the film its notoriety. Check out Brando's soliloquy beside his suicidal wife's coffin. Or his ironic blend of tenderness and misogyny in his scenes with Schneider. Or when he weeps for...what? the impossibility of his romance with Schneider? His lost, blighted past? Or his silent, agonized finale when he sees for the final time the magnificent skyline of Paris. It's easy to become jaded by the films of today, watching as modern Hollywood's so-called stars perfunctorily perform their bland roles by rote, gearing their performances to the lowest common denominator possible. Watching Brando in his blistering and towering performance here reminds one of why acting can be considered an awe-inspring art form and why it was that I used to love going to the movies.",

Is this maybe Loehengrin and not a Bertolucci film?Of course this makes tremendous sense. Marlon is middle aged and not to attractive. Maria is 20 something and drop dead gorgeous. Marlon also comes across as a self pitying dope who cannot string two words together. In another scene he violently sodomizes Schiender. The plot of this film could only exist as a fantasy of a middle aged man.The climax of the film (an expression one hesitates to use for a range of reasons) is when the Brando character falls in love and wants to continue the relationship. Schnieder rejects him rather forcefully end of film.The film has sparse dialogue, Marlon looks dreadful overacts continually and one wonders how anyone took it seriously. Probably because it came out prior to the women&#8217;s movement. It is hard to think of a contemporary director who would produce such a unrealistic portrayal of a female character.",

Marlin Brando takes thelead part, and the command he exhibits over this difficult role, in conveying the depth, and complexity of his character in the film, (Paul), together with the empathy that must be required to fully portray, and give life to, the isolation, and at times despair, with which his character is consumed; allows us, as an audience, to become almost completely immersed, in the poignancy that is so much a part of this film.To many, Last Tango in Paris, has become thought of as a classic, unsurpassed in its ability to move its audience. The plot centres almost exclusively, around the development, and inevitable break, in the relationship between Paul, an estranged, American Ex-Serviceman, living abroad in France, and his Much younger Parisian lover, played by Maria Schneider.There are very few other characters in this film, and although the overall atmosphere is quite surreal; the detail, and paradoxically, the realism, that this allows, puts the films Direction, in a class of its own; briliant in its individuality.This is a must for anybody who takes Film seriously, and indeed, all those who enjoy Cinema, at its absolute best.",

    "review/text": "Let me fist say this; if this film has offended you or left you thinking it nothing more than a pointless perversion then you've clearly missed this entire point and have misunderstood this films purpose.I felt that was important because I've seen this film get unfairly targeted by some who refuse to truly embrace it for what it is. Yes, there was a lot of controversy that surrounded it upon its release; and that NC-17 rating doesn't help matters, immediately drawing the viewer to the obvious reasons for its harsh rating; but underneath the layers of sensuality lies a very poignant portrayal of a mans guilt and grief and how he chooses to free himself of it. If you strip away the gratuitous love scenes you will begin to see into the deep pools of Marlon Brando's phenomenal performance and begin to understand why this film had to be made the way that it was.`Ultimo Tango a Parigi' follows Paul, a widower, shortly after his wife's suicide. Still grieving and obviously searching to separate himself from the whole situation, Paul looks into renting himself an apartment. It just so happens that young Jeanne is also there looking herself to rent the apartment. In a spontaneous and completely anonymous moment of passion the two fall into one another and form a curious relationship that serves as a way out for Paul, a way for him to remove himself from all that is crashing in around him.Paul sets ground rules for the continuance of their relationship; first and foremost being that there is to be no names exchanged. Writer/director Bernardo Bertolucci mentioned that the idea for this film stemmed from his fantasy of making love to woman without ever knowing her name; but what he created with `Ultimo Tango a Parigi' is a film that fully explores why that fantasy happens to be one every man desires. He exposed the draw to such an encounter, allowing the audience to understand why a relationship with absolutely no strings is desirable yet disastrous.The one facet of this film that ultimately elevates it is the acting, all of which leaves me speechless. Maria Schneider is marvelous as Jeanne; truly crawling inside of her and delivering a heartbreaking performance. We are able to understand two sides of this tryst by comparing how Jeanne reacts versus Paul. Schneider gives Jeanne enough humanity to create an honest portrayal of a woman confused and guilty for her own love and affection. She wants to give herself fully to Paul but he refuses to accept her. She is being pursued by her longtime boyfriend Tom yet she can't bring herself to be happy about it. As the film spirals to its close we see the layers of this beautiful soul strip away to reveal a woman scorned by the seemingly selfish actions of a man.And yet still...The term `tour-de-force' was created for performances like Brando's. His portrayal of Paul is seriously why the concept of `awards for acting' was though up. One of the greatest compliments any actor can receive is that of being compared to Marlon Brando. Why do you think his name is so rarely used when describing another actor's work? Marlon Brando was incomparable. What strikes me so hard about this particular performance is that it is fearless, and honestly there are so few fearless performances these days that when one like this comes along you are forced to take notice. The performance isn't fearless because of the taboos his character is forced into, nor because of the dialog he is asked to say but because of the sheer dedication and veracity in which he attacks this role head on, delivering each word and confronting each taboo in a way that no other actor would dare. Paul ultimately because a beautifully fleshed out variation of our own male psyche (or if you happen to be female then the psyche of your male counterpart). His grief upon the sudden and abrupt loss of his wife is written all over his face yet effectively masked by his pursuit of young Jeanne and his complete and total domination of her. One scene in particular, where he asks her to violate him, is truly breathtaking (and precisely the reason why I call his performance `fearless') for it allows us, in a not so pretty fashion, to see all that his wife's suicide has reduced him to.`Ultimo Tango a Parigi' is a marvelous film, a masterpiece at that, and rests firmly at the top of my list of greatest films ever made. This is a film that is often misunderstood, true, but it is a film that is vitally important for it helps us to see the truth behind our own facades and confront the deeper meanings to the actions we so boldly take.",

Without Brando this film would have been utterly boring. It's the kind of film you have to watch a few times in order to make sense of everything. The film just starts and you have to put the pieces together--and character motivation is rather difficult to figure out. In fact, although this film is a good film, it's confusing as to why the characters do what they do. If you love Brando and Bertolucci, I'd recommend seeing this film. If you want to learn technique and style of acting--this is a very good film. I don't think we'll see another actor like Brando who gives memorable performances such as he does in this film.",

    "review/text": "Perhaps I may be speaking blasphemy to all the serious devotees of this prententious film ( I do respect you all though), but &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; gets my vote as the most overrated film in cinema history (with &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; running a very close second.)Like &quot;2001&quot;, Last Tango did break new ground cinematically and for that reason these two films do deserve at least some respect. For its time, &quot;Tango&quot; was in its own way a cultural milestone in terms of its frankness and explicit sexuality. And because &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;Last Tango&quot; broke down many barriers, they did allow for many superior films to follow in their respective wakes. But I do agree with the other reviewers who place &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot; as far more complex and revealing work. &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; is also a superior film dealing with very similar subject matter.However, like the another &quot;X&quot; rated pioneer &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, I just don't think &quot;Tango&quot; has aged well. Although &quot;Cowboy&quot; does hold up to better scrutiny.I find &quot;Tango&quot; neither illuminative, profound, original, erotic, or really compelling as a narrative. I found myself not connected in any way, or really caring at all for any of the characters. Many critics have continued to laud the film as brave. I'm sorry, I see nothing brave in photographing two hours of gravenous self pity.Stories ultimately are about the audience and not the characters, and no, I am not in denial when I say this film is not about me. &quot;American Beauty&quot;, a far superior film (which even contains humour- something this film doesn't know exists!) on all levels speaks to many of the same issues here and in a far more compelling (and entertaining!) manner.Marlon Brando grunts and sweats under his weary life as though everything is terribly important. In doing research on the film, I discovered that most of the dialouge is (not suprising considering its painfull meandering) mostly improvised. Marlon as &quot;Paul&quot; is really talking about &quot;Marlon&quot; the actor and dredging up an endless barrage of psycho-babble. It is no wonder that Marlon has turned his back on acting after this mess. I'm afraid far too many impressionable artists have tried to emmulate what passes as &quot;emotional truth&quot; here and therby destroyed their God given talent as Marlon did. What we get to see here really amounts to nothing more than a filmed therepy session. When the &quot;shocking&quot; ending finally unspooled, I found myself cheering that my ordeal was over.That really is sad for Brando certainly is (or whatever the appropriate tense)the single most influential actor of the 20th Century.The world does need a mature examination of the politics of sexuality and the high stakes carnality plays for. Since this film earned world wide critical acclaim and cult status, it set a crude sort of benchmark for taking things to the extreme sexually on screen. This isn't always a good thing.Besides &quot;American Beauty&quot; other films which deal with the same themes but far more successfully are &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; and the tragic science fiction classic &quot;Seconds&quot;. This film unfortunately doesn't reach the humanity of those other pieces.It certainly is worth watching though, so you can form your own opinion and gain a sense of pop cultural literacy, but for purchase? I don't know. Proceed at your own risk.",

It just seems \"Paul\" and her geeky boyfriend (and Bertolucci) used her as nothing but an object. I wanted to know more about her character and what the deal was with her deceased father and whether Paul putting on her father's uniform hat triggered some sort of rage within. Did he sexually abuse her? Was their relationship incestuous? Other questions plagued me. Was Paul his wife's murderer or the lover? There was just way too much blood splatter for it to have been suicide. Was his wife a former prostitute? The end sickened me because you want (I wanted) \"Jeanne\" and \"Paul\" to fall in love and live happily ever after...but in this demented, even morbid Bertolucci flick that wasn't gonna happen!I was teary at the end because it was just so confusing and tragic...this poor man--despite his actions--finds love, refuge, and happiness and they're all literally shot down.",

The frank dialog, the nudity, and the simulated sex were not gratuitously employed but were integral to the theme of the film, and if the picture was not totally successful, it was certainly unforgettable...Marlon Brando appears as a middle-aged American--but not the kind of American in Paris glorified by either George Gershwin or Ernest Hemingway... This is a man tormented by inner conflict... Brando's Paul between self-hatred over his wife's suicide and his feelings for Maria Schneider's Jeanne, she between her adoring documentary filmmaker fianc&eacute; (based wittily on Godard) and the taboo-breaking Paul...The stark, empty flat that is the lovers' retreat from conventional society, and the cold, windy pavement where Paul screams his loathing for the world against the din of a passing train--connects us with the mood of the film...Eager to escape the oppressive walls of his dark life, Paul embarks on a very complete sexual experience with a willing young woman in which there is no history spoken, no promises of future liaisons, no ties of any kind with the outside...The two lovers know nothing of each other, not even their names... Their affair is purely physical, and the barren apartment becomes, as Bertolucci intended, a world of debauchery on which is explored a catalog of behavior that seems more childish than kinky...Jeanne is a child-woman... She asks what she should call Paul, and they proceed to give themselves names brought only out of grunts, growls and screeches... Paul's cruelty is not justified and perhaps this is what attracts the modish girl... Some scenes emotionally are so provocative that you experience a wide range of feelings... Paul never asks Jeanne a direct question, but is constantly framing her for his next experiment, besides he assaults her, humiliates her and pushes her over the edge... There is one great moment for the heroine when she refuses Paul's power play and is equally unimpressed by his new declarations of love... She insists: 'It's over!'The film is beautifully shot... The cinematography is unique, somber, shadowy and painterly... It presents despair, and the music reinforce the despairing mood... The movie is also intensely erotic, intensely realistic, immensely disturbing... The extreme frankness makes faintly uncomfortable viewing, not only because of its sexual material but because of its exploration of our inner nature with true perspective... Hopefully, younger viewers can turn their minds back to a time when sex was mysterious and beautiful; dangerous and daring; not just easy and transitory... Sex nearly always implies intimacy, but doesn't always provide it...'Last Tango in Paris' is one of the great explorations of cinema's visual possibilities... Bertolucci camera's movements throughout the film characterize the rights steps of the tango which the two main characters execute at the climax of the film... We feel swept away by the beauty of the tango despite the tragic quality of the acts and events it escorts... The film does prove Bertolucci to be a true filmmaker capable of the audacity of Jean-Luc Godard and the distinctive style of Ingmar Bergman...",

One of the highlights that makes this movie great is without a doubt Maria Schneider's revealing nude scenes (...). She is also very pretty, however getting serious for a moment this film was in 1973 when it was release and still today a milestone in filmmaking largely due to Marlon Brando's outstanding performance. He really was one of the greatest actors of all times and his performance in Last Tango in Paris more than proves it. I really like the chemistry that both Brando and Scheneider had together through out the movie but especially in their key scenes together. Marlon Brando sadly enough passed away on July 1, in Los Angeles due to lung failure he was 80. Lucky for all of the people (myself included) who admired and appreciated his great talent as an actor, he left us a thrilling and fantastic collection of wonderful performances that are forever capture on film for all of us to enjoy time and time again. Anyone who is not aware of the contribution that this legendary actor left on American Cinema can begin by either renting or buying some of his most dynamic movies (All of them are available on DVD or VHS).

There's a scene towards the film's end--I won't give it away--that's basically a monologue done with such power and intensity it's downright frightening in its realism. (A similar scene is done by Tom Cruise in &quot;Magnolia&quot; and I can't help but think that Cruise studied Brando's art to create an equally powerful (and painful) performance).Ironically, Brando's role seems a deceptively simple one, and one that could easily have been botched by a lesser actor, but he injects such force into the performance you'll never forget it.

Marlon Brando is simply incredible and this surpasses all of his other films, which is saying a lot. Director Bernardo Bertolucci let Brando improvise a great deal of the script and Brando fell back upon his own life to do it, including memories that dated back to his life with his own parents. He wound these memories into the fictional life of Paul, who at middle age finds himself in a time of madness following his wife's suicide. Paul attracts a young woman by his very unhingedness and she immediately becomes obsessed with him, both romantically and sexually, while he becomes sexually obsessed with her. There are some brilliant soliloquies in the film, which Brando delivers, the best being the one he delivers sitting beside the open casket of his wife. Brando was in his late '40s when he played Paul. He was paunchy, his hair was thinning, he was crazy and you don't doubt for a moment this woman in her 20s falling madly for him. Yes, it is sexually explicit but you will never mistake this for a porno film as it had to be one of the most serious films ever made about love, sex, death, loss and the human condition. If you've missed it up until now, don't let another day go by without seeing it! Maria Schneider plays the young woman well throughout but was never seen much after this movie.

    "review/text": "Last Tango in Paris (Bernardo Bertolucci, 1972)There are as many opinions as to Brando's greatest performance as there are Marlon Brando movies. Last Tango in Paris is my pick. Brando and the almost unforgivably beautiful Maria Schneider (also the first choice to play the lead in Bunuel's That Obscure Object of Desire) scorch the screen in this amazing film.Oddly, for the first fifteen minutes, I thought I was going to hate it. Jeanne (Schneider) is looking for an apartment. Very, very slowly. She encounters Paul (Brando) in one of them, and the two begin a torrid affair for no real reason we can discern (she is engaged but lonely; his wife recently committed suicide). He ends up taking the apartment, and the two continue their affair over the following days before Paul's wife's funeral, while Jeanne's fiance shoots a documentary film about her.Aside from the overly leisurely opening, Bertolucci mixes in the details of the two lives with their affair masterfully. The dynamics of their relationship, of course, change based on what's going on around them, and the whole thing meshes into an almost-perfect look at the dynamics of passion. The icing on the cake is Brando's monologue to his dead wife close to the end of the film; this is the scene that tabbed Brando for an Oscar nomination and won him a number of more minor awards for the film; it should also be noted that this remains the final X-Rated film to receive Oscar nominations, and was the only film rated NC-17 to have received them until Requiem for a Dream. People just don't make X-rated films like they used to!Frank, tempestuous, utterly brilliant. See it. ****",

    "review/text": "The impact of Bernardo Bertolucci's notorious yet widely lauded 1973 film cannot be overstated. A product of the times, Brando is a nihilistic middle-aged widower who indulges - some say, forces - an anonymous sexual encounter with Jeanne, a young girl -- a total stranger -- in an empty Parisian apartment. Rather explicit in its sexuality and nudity, it was rated X. It is still shocking.Maria Schneider is Jeanne and she sears her sensuality, vulnerability and innocence into the minds and hearts of viewers then and now. The sex in the film is indulgent but not really shared by the characters. That anonymity triggers a surprising feeling of victimization. Whether intended or not, watching the film is more unsettling than arousing.The \"butter scene,\" a flash-point of conversation, was not even in the script, but something Brando suggested just before filming. Although the sex was simulated, Schneider's tears were real.The world-wide attention to this landmark film brought instant fame and celebrity to young Maria Schneider. It was not welcome. She felt as if raped by Brando, Bertolucci and the audience. \"Bertolucci is more of a gangster than a movie director. He's one of my enemies.\"Not long ago, the late Schneider said that even though she made many films, this is the one people still ask about. A new Blu-ray edition is an Maria Schneider's sad but brilliant epitaph to lost innocence.",

This film stirred up alot of controversy because of the sexual content, but as usual the prudish always object the most strongly. Brando's performance is fantastic. He captures your interest and concentration the whole movie. The raw emotions portrayed run the complete spectrum too, to which he performed extremely well. One of the movies annoying aspects is Maria's boyfriend/fiance who is running around filming the most silly things constantly with religious fervor. Maria Schneider exhibited the youthful freshness, energy, and sexuality to portray her character well. This is not a movie for everyone.

But what was this crap that was made before I was even born? The way this film was reviewed it made it seem as though it was just awesome! U must see it! Marlon is so captivating!!!This is one of those films where you either love it or hate it. Like the opera, you either love it or hate it. Unfortunately I hated this film. From the way they \"hooked\" up, to the way they told his story... and of course, the ending, what the hell was that?! The movie comes off as too scattered. Like they could not decide which road to take in telling his story to get you to care. So they just threw in a bunch of scenes. I did not feel sorry nor care for any of the main characters. The only reason why I sat and watched the whole movie, was because I bought it.. Highly, Highly disappointing... I can't believe my mother went to the theater to see this film when it came out. But it speaks volumes that my mom (Marlon Brando lover that she is) could not even remember that his wife killed herself and he is this \"tortured\" guy just trying to deal. All she remembered was that it was a racy film for 1972. But what are reviews anyway? Just someone elses opinion. Not your own. So if you wish to see this film watch it. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't... The world makes sense again.",

That must be, like, textbook stuff for all actors since. I especially dug how he worked his own life into the script - like where Paul's talking about his family. And it was really cool how he worked his film characters in there too, i.e., &quot;he was a boxer, but he didn't do so well...&quot; Clever, clever, clever.One of the (many) things that makes Brando such an incredible actor is the way that so many of his performances seem to be intertwined. Like, you'll see something in one of his films, that reminds you of one of his others. In Last Tango, the scene where he's playing with the lampshade made me think of the paper lantern over the light bulb in A Streetcar Named Desire.",

But if you want to see one of the best performances of the last 40 years, see Brando in his finest work. This movie shook Hollywood to the core with it's stark realization. Hollywood would return the favor by blacklisting any filmaker that would make such a sexually graphic movie! It would not be until Philip Kaulfman's \"Henry & June\" in 1988 that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) readjusted the rating from \"X\" to \"NC-17\".",

    "review/text": "I agree with the central theme of &quot;Last Tango&quot; and enjoyed some of the acting but overall I felt it was a very weak film and certainly not what I would expect from great masters such as Bertolucci and Brando.The film is about an American man named Paul (Brando) who cannot come to terms with his wife's suicide. He has a debauched and somewhat sadistic affair with a woman named Jeanne (Maria Schneider) whom he meets in an empty apartment. The lovers agree to meet each other as long as they adhere to Paul's insistence that they not reveal anything about each other's identity including their names and personal histories. They continue their torrid love affair for an unspecified period of time with several notable episodes. At one point with the assistance of some globs of butter, Paul pokes Jeanne in the posterior while making her recite some church liturgy. But in a moment of fair play, he subsequently insists that she clip her nails and provide him with a dual-digit rectal probe. All of this was scandalous in the early seventies but barely raises an eyebrow today, which is probably one reason why a lot of reviewers can't understand all the hype about the film's daring, revolutionary nature. Eventually Paul comes to terms with his wife's suicide and decides to pursue a conventional relationship with Jeanne. But as Jeanne correctly surmises, the two of them can only coexist under the conditions of anonymity that previously governed their relationship.Thematically, I am in complete agreement with the film. A relationship with emotional and sexual honesty can only take place in an environment that is free of obligations, identities and personal histories. But such a relationship is bound to be short lived. This theme was explored with much greater artistic depth and insight in &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot;.The acting left much to be desired. Brando being Brando has a few wonderful moments but generally comes across as grisly, semi-articulate slab of meat. This film could have been truly great if Bertolucci had paid attention to structure and dialogue and developed the story more around the anonymous sexual relationship. Instead, he simply threw the film's components together and declared it to be dangerous. Too bad.",

Maybe it's Maria Schneider, one of the worst actress I've had the opportunity to admire. Maybe it's the screenplay, so perfect.THE LAST TANGO IN PARIS was a huge success in 1972, considering the fact that Bernardo Bertolucci was at that time more appreciated by the european marxist intelligentsia than by the common saturday night's moviegoer. But Marlon and very explicit sex scenes provoked scandal and success. It's fair to admit now that the majority of the audience was more interested in Marlon and Maria's naked bodies than in the anarchic and iconoclastic substance of the movie.One can like the symmetry of these stories treating of the relations between symbolic fathers, mothers, sons, daughters who could be symbols for society, death and I don't know what !

    "review/text": "Before watching this movie I heard nothing but great things about this film. I heard people say it Bernardo Bertolucci's best film. I heard people say it's Marlon Brando's best performance ever! And I've even heard people say, it stands as one of the greatest films ever! I'm mixed between this movie. On one hand I can say, it's an intriguing piece of work, with wonderful directing by one of my favorite directors, Bertoluuci. It has great photography by Vittorio Storaro, and has memorable acting with memorable lines. On the other hand, I can see why one wouldn't like this film. It's not a family movie. It's not a &quot;feel good&quot; film either. It does seem to drag a bit. And the score by Gato Barbieri seems misplaced. But, trying to judge the movie fairly, I would have to say that people should try and make an effort to see this movie. It does offer many enjoyable moments. And it has also stood the test of time by staying with us after all these years. The screenplay by Arcalli and Bertolucci does get slow at times and can be boring at moments, but believe it or not, it does contain heart. It's about a man who has just lost his wife, and to me, seems as if, without her, life has lost it's meaning. Despite the fact she was cheating on him. So he meets Jeanne (Maria Schneider) and begin an unforgettable affair with a stick of butter and dead rats lol. The scene where Brando is paying his respect to his wife is considered a standout, and one can see why. But to say this is Brando's best film, I have to disagree. I personally like &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot;. But I think Bertolucci fans will be pleased with this movie as will many others. If your a bit skeptical about seeing this movie, I'll offer you a warning. Don't watch this movie and expect a fast paced, heartfelt, or romantic movie. And don't watch it when your in a &quot;good&quot; mood. The movie will just bring you down with it's &quot;depressing&quot; storyline. Still though, it remains, I feel, as one of Bertolucci's best directing efforts.",

The Gato Barbieri musical soundtrack is great, if you like jazz, and the reproductions of the great paintings by Francis Bacon establish the mood of the piece as the opening credits roll. It's all very artful. The film's soul, however, is not upbeat, the ending is a downer, as we say, and the relationship is a joyful, but confining dead end. The American bohemian played by Brando is seeking to achieve a love that is pure and free, but in the end his lover cares very much about status and class and will not be possessed by a nobody. The film either speaks to you or it doesn't. I have felt moved and affected in one showing, and then turned off in another. The relationship of an large, sexually cruel man with a young 'chick' has far less appeal these days, so one may find the film dated for its sexual dynamic. It is not so much that such relationships no longer exist, but that one may no longer find them exhilarating. On the other hand, it is the director's masterpiece of personal connections and his only successful film of intimacy. His other great works tend to be epics, where the films encompass a grander scale.",

    "review/text": "Fascinating drama of middle-aged man's attempt to bury painful memories of his wife's suicide by indulging in a purely sexual relationship with a young woman. Marlon Brando portrays this man with an intensity that has rarely been matched by any other actor in any film. His performance is a powerhouse of human emotion as he enacts the deeds of a self-loathing individual who cannot communicate with anyone in a decent manner. He overpowers, scares, and at times humiliates them. His reasons for this may seem self-serving, but underneath you realize that they are just the result of a person who doesn't know how to express the way he feels. Brutish as he is, there is an undeniable vulnerabiltiy to the character. There is the sense that he is trying to say something, but has no idea what it is. His sexual and emotional abuse of the girl is the closest to relating his fears, desires, and longing for someone to love that he can come to. It is a realization that is eventually reached when, at the end of the film, he tries to open up, only to discover that it is too late. Director Bernardo Bertolucci did a magnificent job of displaying humanity at its most uncompromising, humorous, and shocking. The dialogue between the characters is nothing short of brilliant. Through their words we are allowed to glimpse to the very core of their beings; what we find there is up to us to decide, since Bertolucci makes no judgments on them. Repulsion and attraction are equally infused into them. At times, they aren't even sure why they do some of the things they do. It is for this reason that it is so easy for people to relate to them: they are by no means perfect, and don't pretend that they are. Despite its X-rating, &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; is anything but exploitational. This is a stark contrast to the explicit nature of the film. And this is also its genius. What many later motion pictures failed to realize was that &quot;Last Tango&quot; was graphic for a reason. The actions of the characters defined their needs, their insecurities; it showed us parts of their souls, rather than just parts of their bodies. Erotic, intelligent, and mesmerizing, &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; is a sterling example of what makes a film great.",

They just played soccer all afternoon!!\"So why complain that a European talking-heads film is full of static, self-indulgent psycho-babble?Actually, I didn't think it was that bad. The back-story is missing, so you have to fill that in. The guy is not that classy but he's sincere within his limitations. He is coming to a dead-end in his life and even though he can see that his own shortcomings contributed you can understand that he's flat and doesn't see much hope for himself. His accosting a random young girl has a \"What can I lose?\" character to it, and her accepting him seems gradually to have some healing effect.She's full of herself because she has the physical attractiveness of a young women and she's open to adventure and a variety of games. Her criminal but childish selfishness at the end shows how far she has to go to grow up. Not that unusual if you take away the theatrical exaggeration.My middling, three-star rating stems from the film's static pacing, tough-to-see lighting, mumbling, and cheesy saxophone score. We're probably as boring in real life as this film is, but cinema should be able to portray that without actually being boring itself.The comments above all relate to the film overall. On the two leads, I'm hardly an authority but they seem to do their jobs very well. Neither one is glamorously pretty, which gives the drama some grown-up realism about how life is for imperfect people.",

    "review/text": "Back in the cinematic Middle Ages, a movie that reached too far into the sexual realm -- let alone the psycho/sexual domain -- was considered &quot;too racy&quot; for American sensibilities. &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot; was such a film. Like a famous painting, we've heard of it, but hardly understand what the fuss is about. And as with any work of art, once experienced, it takes time to fully digest.This is a dark and surreal film -- you won't be compelled to run through the fields singing like Julie Andrews once it's over. But if you savor stories that delve into the nether regions of the human psyche, it's like a cup of unsweetened, black coffee; strong, with a bitter bite.My recommendation of this movie is based, almost entirely, on Marlon Brando's performance. Director, Bernardo Bertolucci, is reputed to have spurred him on by relating, &quot;This film is about your psychoanalysis... and mine!&quot; Brando responded by offering us a chillingly realistic portrayal, of a man who's scraping the bottom of the emotional barrel. Among other parts, the infamous &quot;pig scene,&quot; and the delirious finale, will -- yet again -- convince you of Brando's monolithic acting talent.It's regrettable that this film has so many dead spots, and that the tale is too flat. Nontheless, it stands as a notch on the belt of a great actor's career. No Marlon Brando fan should do without it!",

    "review/text": "This is one of those movies where reading the negative reviews is far more interesting and even funnier than reading the positive ones. The positive ones usually gush about what a groundbreaking movie it was, and its unvarnished portrayal of a completely carnal relationship lacking any other redeeming qualities. Brando is usually thought to have done a remarkable job portraying a depressed man who is trying to lose himself in an orgy of erotic self-indulgence after the suicide of his wife. Another common complaint is that the movie, although perhaps great for its time, hasn't held up very well.Amazingly, I had never seen the movie until a few days ago, and felt this was a huge lacunae in my cinematic education so I decided to watch it. While I'm not as negative as the other negative reviews, I have to admit that they have some validity. It was a ground and pathbreaking movie for its time, and it deserves some credit for that, which is why I give it at least two stars.Unfortunately, I have to agree with many of the other negative reviews here that the movie just hasn't aged well. I also agree with many of the other comments that in ad libbing much of the dialog, the script, or lack of one, suffers and it just sounds like Brando on some analyst's couch engaging in sophomoric psycho-babble much of the time. But one must remember that this was the inner-space obsessed and psychedelic 60s and things like psychotherapy were all the rage, which is why the movie just sounds like Brando on the couch free-associating much of the time. It was also a time of supposed sexual liberation, and in that sense the movie accurately reflects its milieu but attempts to ratchet up the shock value on the carnal side, from which the movie's notorious and vaunted reputation mostly seems to stem.While all of that is fine, and I'm certainly no prude, a movie whose main attraction is its portrayal of a steamy, nihilistic, and exploitative sexual relationship but which lacks any other redeeming qualities may be a good candidate for the most sexually and sensually daring and controversial movie of its time, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's a great movie, either. There is no character development, and no story arc beyond that of a dissipated, depressed, middle-aged man indulging his sexual fantasies with an ingenue.The dialog is mediocre at best, and except for the very emotional early scene by Brando, he spends most of the rest of the movie walking around like he's in a Quaalude-induced haze, although that drug was 15 years in the future. And by today's standards the movie wouldn't be considered sexually shocking at all. But then this was also the era of Leave it to Beaver which was considered a realistic portrayal of an American family. It's also one unremitting, humorless downer from beginning to end, as Brando wallows in his narcissistic world of grandiose and bottomless self-pity. This might have been okay for 15 minutes, but 2 hours of it is too much.So while I'm not as negative as many of the reviewers here, I can give it only 2 or maybe 2.5 stars. It certainly deserves some credit for breaking new ground in its portrayal of a sexually explicit and kinky relationship, there are one or two scenes in which Brando truly is great, and as one negative reviewer here said, it's something of an achievement to manage to make Paris look ugly.And last but not least, I hear the Cornhole Review rates it \"5 sticks of butter.\" :-)",

    "review/text": "In this movie Brando gives, what was arguably the best performance of his career, as the widowed, distraught Paul, plunging into the very depths of nihilism and despair. However, what I did not like about this movie was the lack of character development for Jeanne (Schneider), the young Parisian, in which Paul (Brando) has his no names tryst with. I didn't understand why she fell for Paul, or why she was such a willing participant in these sexual escapades with him, was it low-self esteem, boredom, curiousity, what was it? I didn't really understand her. Nor did I connect with her character, and in fact, felt less than sympathetic for her and at times found her to be quite annoying. Also I was disappointed with the movie's ending. I didn't mind him being killed, because he wanted to die--he simply didn't have the guts or the will to pull the trigger. But what I didn't like, was that all of a sudden, Paul falls for Jeanne...out of nowhere--WHY?! What was the turning point, it just didn't make sense. I felt it was contrived, unrealistic and somewhat partronizing and unfair to the two main characters in the film. There needed to be some justification for this sudden change of behavior. I would have preferred Paul (Brando), after having his last \"encounter\" with Jeanne to simply disapear, and to have the audience along with Jeanne wondering, what had happened to him. Or perhaps would have preferred him becoming so delusional and broken from reality that he begins to see Jeanne as his dead wife Rose. I even think there is a part where Paul (Brando) calls her Rose--this was only hinted at, but it should have been more fully developed but unfortunately it was not. So instead we are left with him, overnight metamorphisizing from a nihilist to a jubiliant fop who miraculously falls in love with Jeanne and madly pursues her and wants to build a life with her, yet still, without even knowing her name.Despite these flaws, however, I feel this movie is still magnificient, giving a look into the psychology and depth of grief, anger, nihilism and despair, which more than makes up for its flaws. I found myself, deeply moved by Brando's performance. And realized he put alot of his own personal experiences into this movie, which for a Brando admirer, only heightened my appreciation for this movie.Visually this film has great coloration and is wonderfully shot, thanks to great cinematography by Vittorio Storaro. And the music by Gato Barbieri, is at times sultry as it is haunting.After watching this movie I was left feeling depressed, deeply moved, captivated and confused (because of the ending). Admittedly, in order to appreciate this movie, I had to be very open-minded. It's not a movie for everyone, nor is it a movie to gather the whole family around and eat popcorn and be entertained. But if you are willing to be open-minded, which is key, and put yourself in someone else's shoes--who finds his own unconventional and disturbing way to deal with his own grief, then you may find, like me, that Last Tango in Paris, is a flawed masterpiece with empty pieces to the puzzle, but is still a masterpiece nontheless.",

Every time I see this movie I'm amazed all over again at how good it is. Brando, nominated for an academy award for best actor for his performance here, is simply stunning. As always he takes over and commands any scene he is in. When the film was first released, most of the media attention was about the extremely naturalistic sex scenes between Brando, who plays a 45-year-old whose wife has just committed suicide, and Maria Schneider, a beautiful 20-year-old beauty about to be married. Then there was all the hoopla about the episode with the stick of butter, the fingernail trimming scene, etc. What many reviewers and critics overlooked-- as I recall it now-- was at its core this movie is not just another movie bordering on soft porn but makes extremely serious and profound statements about life: who of us can really know anyone else, love can be found in very unlikely places, the undercurrent of violence often connected with sex, all the ramifications of sex with a stranger, and what happens when lust turns into love, for instance.While Maria Schneider is certainly no slouch-- and a beauty both naked and clothed-- this film ultimately is Brando's. Kaleidoscopically he goes from the comic to rage to uncontrollable anguish and back again. The story is that he improvised many of his lines, giving his performance a very fresh, natural feel.The film is beautifully filmed and very visual. There are many images repeated-- the overground Metro shots for instance-- and scenes between Brando and Schneider lead into similar frames between Schneider and her young fiancee.This film is directed by another genius, Bernado Bertolucci and is like nothing else Brando did. He certainly gives one of his finest performances here.",

    "review/text": "I saw this when came out, as a high school student with a girlfriend. Needless to say, we both found it beyond shocking, truly horrible in its angst and rage and cruelty. Brando, a damaged and unhappy man whose life is in ruins, meets an empty and inexperienced girl, who submits to his sado-masochistic \"numbers\" with incomprehensible passivity. Perhaps she is bored, perhaps she wants relief from her bourgeois life - a clinging mother and unbearably insipid boyfriend - or wants to experience something raw and new, it is impossible to say. It is like she is an empty vessel, an object, for the horrible things he does to her. There is plenty of nudity, some iconic scenes like the butter one, but few normal human emotions. The Brando character is pure despair and loneliness in an extraordinary performance.He sets the rules: they meet in an empty apartment for sexual experimentation. They are to tell eachother nothing of their outside lives, not even their names. Their brutal meetings are interspersed with scenes from their lives, he in despair over the suicide of his wife, she on the path to a life with a filmmaker of the most idiotic pretension, filming their life yet afraid of any honest emotion with her. They are both empty and lost. It is pathetic.Gradually, they begin to learn about the other, in particular in descriptions by Brando of his unhappy childhood. She is an innocent, too inexperienced to understand how Brando is using her and why, merely going along for the ride. Schneider is beautiful, but her character is shallow, perhaps because of her acting she is not at all interesting beyond being a pleasure object. When he tries to take it to another step, to meet outside the apartment, the ending didn't quite ring true to me, except for the casual indifference he felt towards his impending death.Seeing it again as a man older than Brando and after so many imitations and overly brainy conversations about it, I thought that the film was still quite good. I didn't \"freak out\" the way I did at the first viewing, but the sadness of it all remains deeply affecting. Sex and despair are no longer shocking to filmgoers as they were when I was young, but it is great art house cinema and worth a viewing for any film buff who is interested in the history of the medium.Recommended. This is like a modern equivalent of Balzac in its magical realism.",

When your work is touted as being \"like\" some earlier, successful work, you can be sure what is really being said is your work is not all that good and needs some hype to move it off the shelves.So it took me 33 years to finally get around to watching \"Last Tango...\" and that is all to the good because if I had watched it when I was young, the barbarous sexuality would have sorely distracted me. Well, Maria Schneider (Jeanne) would have. She is very sexy and is shown complete (\"she comes complete\"!) in a number of scenes. Her acting ability has been challenged by some, but I thought she did a nice job in a difficult role.Problem was she was paired opposite Marlon Brando (Paul) who was busy giving one of his greatest performances. Brando said some time afterwards that he never wanted to do anything like this again. Presumably he was referring to the depressing nature of human sexuality portrayed in the film. This is ironic since most of the raunchy and degrading lines are spoken by Brando who improvised them himself! He later commented that some of the lines written by director Bernado Bertolucci were not to his liking. What I think happened is Bertolucci wanted to live out as a director one of his youthful fantasies (raw, anonymous sex with a young beauty) and Brando, with his ultra sophistication about such matters, played his part with a brutal satirical edge, perhaps making fun of Bertolucci's fantasy, turning it into an unpleasant, hard reality.But the \"reality\" was a bit over the top for everybody. The infamous \"Get the butter\" scene, which was improvised by Brando and Bertolucci (to Schneider's dismay), made it clear that Paul considered Jeanne an animal that you used and nothing more. The dead rat scene and all the pig talk, ditto. Brando was also projecting his own feelings. He was 48-years-old when the film was released and was getting a paunch and losing his muscle tone. All the sex scenes but one are filmed with Brando clothed so as not to make the decline of his physical prowess obvious. He projected his own feelings about the decline of his body by referring derisively to his hemorrhoids, his prostate, and his paunch.What Brando does so very well here is become that animalistic, but thinking brute who has his way with women because they cannot resist his alpha male prowess regardless of the gray in his hair. The early scene in the apartment when the nameless Brando just takes the nameless Schneider without so much as a spoken word or a caress might make women say \"if only more men could be so commanding,\" and men say \"I wish I had that kind of confidence.\" I am reminded of Brando's Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) except that here little is left to the imagination. The Brando that was Kowalski at twenty-seven (with an I.Q. upgrade) could easily be the Brando that was Paul at forty-eight.Almost all the discussion about this movie is about Brando, and that is certainly understandable since, despite all the ugliness of the film, it featured one of Brando's greatest performances. However, the movie was and is Bertolucci's. He wrote it and directed it. His original cut runs something like four hours. The version here rated NC-17 runs 136 minutes. The problem is that just about everything in the movie that does not included Brando is a bit of an anticlimax or an irrelevancy. Jean-Pierre Leaud (Tom) of Truffaut's The Four Hundred Blows (1959) fame plays a film maker and Jeanne's intended. He was possibly chosen for the film because his boyish style and demeanor would contrast so sharply with Brando's commanding style. Two lovers had Jeanne: one was easy and boring, the other was scary and exciting. But I think Bertolucci was also having some fun with the French cinema and especially with Francois Truffaut. Perhaps it is only a coincidence that a year later Truffaut would release Day for Night (1973) (La Nuit americaine) in which Truffaut plays a director directing Leaud in a kind of pleasing but lightweight film contrasting sharply with the dark psychosis of Last Tango.I don't think I could sit through the four hour version but it might be a good learning experience for young film makers. At any rate, perhaps some of the seeming illogic of the film might become reasonable, including the all too easy and not entirely explicable ending. I rate this film very highly because it was innovative (rather shocking for its time), with a fine jazz score, but mostly because of Brando's stellar performance and the sensual beauty of a 20-year-old Maria Schneider. By the way, the film is in French and English with subtitles. Brando's French is amusing, and whoever dubbed Schneider's English has a cute and witty voice.Another excellent (and very beautiful) film by Bertolucci is The Conformist (1970) starring Jean-Louis Trintignant, Stefania Sandrelli, and Dominique Sanda. Interestingly enough Sanda was originally picked for Last Tango, as was Trintignant, and she would have given some needed depth to Jeanne's character, but she declined I guess because of all the nudity. Ironically a few years later Schneider was tabbed to play the lead in Luis Brunuel's That Obscure Object of Desire (1977) but dropped out during the filming reportedly because of a nude scene! Maybe she was afraid of becoming typecast.I guess the bottom line on Last Tango is that it is an uncomfortable film illuminated by a veracious Parisian feel and a truly stunning performance by one of the greatest actors to ever grace the silver screen.",

    "review/text": "Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider star in this powerful film about an older American man, a younger French woman, and the heights of sexuality and seduction.Brando stars as Paul, a 45-year-old American widower who's coming to grips with his wife's suicide. His wife slit her wrists in the bathroom, leaving no note behind for Paul. All that she left him was the ownership of the seedly flop-house motel she had owned. Forced to deal with this bizarre change of events in his life, Paul goes out searching for an apartment.Schneider stars as Jeanne, a young 20-year-old Parisian girl. She's sexy, vivacious, flirtatious, innocent, and adventerous all at the same time. She's engaged to be married to her filmmaker boyfriend. She, too, is looking for an apartment.By chance, Jeanne and Paul end up looking at the same apartment. Both are intrigued; not just by the apartment, but by each other as well. Soon, they are having rough sex up against the wall. What begins after this encounter is a bizarre yet meaningful relationship which exists only inside the apartment. No names are exchanged, no pasts discussed. Only the present matters for these two tortured souls. Their apartment has become a sanctuary where they can come together as one.As the movie progresses, it becomes apparent that Paul and Jeanne are truly falling for each other, but neither is sure how to proceed with the next step. Unsure, Jeanne returns to the arms of her \"boyfriend\", while Paul struggles with his feelings for Jeanne. Finally, he reveals his true feeling outside of the apartment, professing his love for Jeanne. Will she believe it, or will something happen to shake up the ending?When this film was originally released in 1973, it drew the dreaded \"X\" rating for the sexuality and language. Somehow, it was reduced to NC-17 for the DVD version. Despite the rating, the movie is still very good. Brando and Schneider are simply marvelous in their roles as Paul and Jeanne. Brando's performance won him an academy award nomination. I had a slight problem with the English subtitles, but it in no way affected how I felt about the movie overall. The plot is extremely well-developed, and the characters fit perfectly into the story. I highly recommend this great film. Watch this movie and see one of Marlon Brando's great film performances.",

    "review/text": "Marlon Brando's tortured performance and Maria Schneider's sumptuous beauty drive \"The Last Tango in Paris,\" an otherwise straightforward arthouse film made infamous for its (for the time) graphic sex scenes. Before director Bernardo Bertolucci would hit his stride with emotionally and cinematically vibrant films like \"1900\" and \"The Last Emperor,\" he operated on a much smaller scale, preferring introspective dramas like this one. Brando plays a skulking widower who throws himself into an increasingly disturbed fling with the sexually free young woman (Schneider) who falls for him. As emotions boil to the surface, the two find themselves on a collision course with disaster. The thin plot--made thinner by Brando's sometimes hokey ad-libbing--is just an excuse to watch these two performers, and this is where the film shines. Brando has rarely been better; his Paul is a fascinating amalgam of rage, grief, and lust, driven mad by forces he can't control. Schneider is stunning, both in portraying the conflicted sensibilities of a young woman who is simultaneously worldly and innocent and for just being downright gorgeous, undressed and otherwise. The two have genuine chemistry onscreen, and in the handful of trysts they perform, are entirely believable as a couple. That Bertolucci photographs them in warm light against squalid backgrounds adds an air of eroticism to a film that is more about the dangers of desire than the joys of romance. As with \"Monster's Ball,\" though, its willingness ultimately to allow the performances to take center stage is both an asset and a liability for \"The Last Tango in Paris.\"",

    "review/text": "In 1972, a film titled \"Last Tango in Paris\" became one of the most controversial films of all time.Written and directed by Bernardo Bertolucci (\"The Conformist\", \"The Last Emperor\", \"The Dreamers\"), co-written with Franco Arcalli (\"Once Upon a Time in America\", \"1900') and a French adaptation by French New Wave director Agnes Varda (\"Cleo from 5 to 7', \"Vagabond\"), the film would shock viewers at the time for its sexual violence and emotional turmoil.The MPAA gave the film an X rating and later revised 25-years later to receive an NC-17 rating. But while the film would become a cover story in \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\" and receive notoriety, film critics such as Pauline Kael would say that the film \"has made the strongest impression on me in almost twenty years of reviewing. This is a movie people will be arguing about, I think, for as long as there are movies\" (Pauline Kael, \"For Keeps, 30 Years at the Movies\", pg. 455). Her review was so popular that it was used as a double-page ad in the Sunday New York Times and film critic Roger Ebert would describe Kael's lengthy review as \"the most famous review ever published\".Meanwhile, internationally the film would be sold out at various theaters, receive positive reviews from French publications and many would travel far just to watch the movie in France due to censorship. Unfortunately, in Bertolluci's country of Italy, he was put on trial for \"obscenity\" as the Italian prosecutor called the film \"self-serving pornography\". Bertolucci would serve a four month suspended sentence in prison and his civil rights revoked for five years, making him ineligible to vote.And now this controversial film receives its Blu-ray release in America in its original, uncut and uncensored version.\"Last Tango in Paris\" revolves around two individuals.Paul (played by Marlon Brando, \"The Godfather\", \"The Fugitive Kind\", \"On the Waterfront\", \"A Streetcar Named Desire\") is a man who is mourning the suicide of his wife Rosa. He can be seen looking disheveled walking around Paris with tears streaming down his eyes.Jeanne (played by Maria Schneider, \"The Passenger\") is a young 20-year-old who awaits her boyfriend, a young TV director and a filmmaker named Tom (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, \"The 400 Blows\", \"Masculin Feminin\", \"Love on the Run\", \"Made in U.S.A.\") to come home. For the meantime, she is looking for an apartment to rent.Both individuals frequent similar areas but not one time did they look at each other.When Jeanne does find an apartment to look at, she notices that the man, Paul is there. It appears that both are looking at the same apartment and it is not known who will get the apartment first. But yet, she stays knowing he is there and is not afraid of him. When she thinks he does leave, he just closed the door, goes up to her and immediately starts kissing her and both have sex in the apartment.After they have sex, the two don't have much communication but they go on their separate ways.For Jeanne, she is to meet Tom at the train and next thing you know, the whole interaction is being filmed by her boyfriend who wants to capture their love on 16mm, as cinema.As for Paul, when he arrives back home, he sees the woman cleaning the bath tub that is still filled with blood after his wife's suicide (she cut herself with a blade).The next day, we find out that Paul has rented the apartment for several days and both he and Jeanne will have anonymous sexual relationship. The rules are simple, no names, no talking about anything of their personal life because none of it matters in the apartment. The apartment is for them to have sex.Each time the two are together, Jeanne wants to know who he is but Paul reminds her to not talk about anything personal as the apartment is only for them to have sex. They will not see each other outside of the apartment.With Paul, we see how much sexual anger that he has when he does things to Jeanne in the apartment, whether she wants to or not, she submits. Outside of the apartment, Paul is a much different person. As his wife's mother comes to visit their flop-house hotel (which Paul runs and originally belonged to his deceased wife's parents) in preparation for her daughter's funeral. Paul treats her badly as she wants her daughter to be mourned in church, something he does want because she killed herself and the church does not respect those who kill themselves. He is very condescending towards his mother-in-law and if anything, he is unsure of why his wife killed herself. He has isolated himself in the hotel, no friends, just talking to those who stay at the hotel, including the man that his wife had an affair with.As for Jeanne, we learn that she is the daughter of a deceased colonel, living in a nice apartment with her mother and with her boyfriend Tom who is back, he wants to marry her by the end of the week.But while Paul and Jean have this secret sexual encounter for the next few days, how will they treat each other when they stop and see each other outside of the apartment and get to know each other for real?VIDEO:\"Last Tango in Paris\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 widescreen). First, its important for note that this is a 1972 film and for the most part, I was expecting to see some aging of the film. Surprisingly, \"Last Tango in Paris\" looks fantastic on Blu-ray compared to its older DVD counterpart. I think those who watch this film will be surprised to see the amount of detail and clarity that they will see while watching this film on Blu-ray.You can see the tears flowing through Paul's eyes, you can see the detail of his hairy arms, right down to the blood splattered after his wife's suicide. There were details that I didn't recognize at first. Such as the messy spotting on the mirrors and for the most part, I feel this is a pretty awesome upgrade on Blu-ray.But the picture quality is not entirely perfect. I did notice a few debris but otherwise, the blacks are deep, skin tones are natural looking and overall, a pretty solid transfer. And I just have to say that the cinematography for this film, courtesy of Vittorio Storaro (\"Apocalypse Now\", \"Bullworth\", \"The Last Emperor\", \"Dick Tracy\") is magnificent!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:\"Last Tango in Paris\" is presented in English Mono DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Mono and French Mono. The film is primarily dialogue-driven and features a score by Gato Barbieri. But because it is a mono-track, don't expect immersive sounds coming from the surround channels. But I will say that the dialogue is clear and that the film does showcase dialogue in English and French. I detected no problems with the audio.Subtitles are presented in English SDH and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Last Tango in Paris\" comes with the original theatrical trailer.JUDGMENT CALL:One of the most controversial films of all time has received its Blu-ray release that is uncut and uncensored.Back in 1972, the film received an X rating, while now, it's rated NC-17. Reading a summary or synopsis of \"Last Tango in Paris\" really doesn't give the film much justice. For one, the efficacy of this film is in Bertolucci's filmmaking style of giving his actors a chance to bring out the character without guidance.For Marlon Brando, this is where he excels. Call it improvisational, this is a man who took on the character of Paul and brought him to life. And for many cinema fans at the time, many were clamoring for more Brando the year after \"The Godfather\", so needless to say, many were shocked to see him in such a film.As for actress Maria Schneider, you can tell that she fed off the energy of Marlon Brando. Her character of Jeanne is a woman that has spunk. She seems like a strong-willed individual but when she's at the apartment alone with Paul, she seems to crave this domination sexually by Paul. She doesn't know what will happen and she definitely does not like the anonymity but she feels herself drawn to him or the danger of having sex with someone you don't know and will never know.There is no doubt about it, the character of Paul is about sexual domination. Because of their anonymity, Paul feels he can do what he want, get what he wants and for Jeanne, she submits but she also does what she wants when she's in the apartment. There is no love between Paul and Jeanne, it's literally a film about two people engaging in poisonous sex.You may be reading this and wondering \"what makes this film so controversial\"? Although there have been films since \"Last Tango in Paris\" that have gone even further such as Nagisa Oshima's \"In the Realm of the Senses\", you just don't get a magnificent actor such as Marlon Brando to be in such a film. But it happened.You will see scenes where Paul gets a stick of butter that Jeanne has brought to the apartment and shoves it up her and sodomizes her while she cries in pain. Another scene features Paul directing Jeanne to cut her nails and then to shove her fingers up him.These are just a few of those sexual scenes shown through the film. But watching it now, especially in compared to Oshima's \"In the Realm of the Senses\", while we do see Jeanne completely nude throughout the film, for Brando, he is always seen wearing clothes when he has sex with Jeanne. I often wonder if that was by choice of the director/Brando to show his domination while in clothes and then unzipping his zipper whenever he wants to partake in sex or was it because Brando didn't feel comfortable showing off his own skin. Who knows?But I do know that for 1972, this type of content for a film was shocking. Not only do you get a film that features spectacular cinematography, wonderful direction and excellent performance by Marlon Brando, it's very creative and artistic of how the sex was such a big part of this film but how the characters were portrayed.And it's quite interesting to see what happens when Paul stops going to the apartment and both individuals meet each other in reality. I don't want to spoil the film but it was quite intriguing.Pauline Kael wrote \"Realism with terror of actual experience still alive on the screen - that's what Bertolucci and Brando achieve\". She is absolutely right. Despite Brando wearing his clothes during the act of sex, it's just the nature of how this film was shot and how Brando transforms to this immoral being, he brings out the self-centeredness of the character. We are drawn to his personal view of society but at the same time, repulsed by him. It's the efficacy of Brando's acting that made \"Last Tango in Paris\" work. Without him, I don't even think this film would have registered as a blip on anyone's radar.Marlon Brando is one of the better examples of a method actor, one who takes on the persona of the character and somehow manages to live and breath that character and I wanted to know more about this.And this is where it comes down to the Blu-ray release and my feelings that I wish there was some post-interview or special feature included. I enjoyed the Blu-ray but the fact that its devoid of any special features (especially knowing how Bertolucci \"The Last Emperor\" was heavy on special features), you just felt that there should have been more to this Blu-ray. But all one is going to find on this Blu-ray release is a trailer.Granted, this is the best looking and sounding version of the \"Last Tango in Paris\" to date. It's a no-brainer that this Blu-ray release is a wonderful upgrade but at the same time, I just wished there was more to it, in terms of special features content.Overall, \"Last Tango in Paris\" is a film that definitely had an impact on cinema and for many, they consider it a Bertolucci masterpiece and perhaps Brando's greatest acting achievement. The late Pauline Kael has said that some people will be very angry, some will feel disgusted. Or like her, feel that the film is not only important but resonate strongly as a film with a major impact.Does this 1972 film still have impact on those of us today? Probably not as much as it did back then, but if you are able to put yourself in the shoes of those who watched this film back in 1972, you can realize how bold and scandalous this film was at the time. Will you love it or hate it? I'll leave that up to you.",

    "review/text": "This is a great film. I'm not sure it \"altered the face of an art form,\" as Kael said, but that's because only the rarest artists can carry off such an unblinking look inside a soul. Marlon Brando is such an artist, and even he only tried it once.I've been watching a lot of Brando movies since he died, and he is never less than mesmerizing -- even when he is infuriating. (See \"The Missouri Breaks,\" say, or \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\") His performance in \"Last Tango\" is the best he ever gave, and one of the finest ever committed to film by any actor.The movie is not all Brando, of course. Bertolucci conceived the whole thing, had a hand in the dialogue, and somehow got his actors to go places they were probably reluctant to go. I mention the dialogue, because it must have imprinted itself in my memory: I had not seen the movie since I went to see it (and immediately see it again) in a threatre when it was released, but I remembered long patches of words, particularly the soliloquies, almost as if I had memorized them. I had forgotten how good Maria Schneider is, and how callow Jean-Pierre Leaud is made to seem. I did not remember the Francis Bacon paintings at the start, with the titles. (I wonder, in fact, if they were not used in the U.S. version that I saw originally.) I remembered the wailing saxophone of Gato Barbieri -- but forgot that the soundtrack is actually by Oliver Nelson. I also forgot that Vittorio Storaro shot the film, for the most part in a cold, washed-out light that is untypical of him.All that said, however, it is primarily Brando, and about the last time we got to see him working with a great director and invested in his own performance. It is instructive to watch \"Last Tango\" back-to-back with \"The Godfather.\" Both movies were released the same year (1972), and must have been filmed within a short time of each other; but I can imagine someone unfamiliar with Marlon Brando watching the two performances and not realizing the same actor gave them both. In the role of Vito Corleone, he is all craft and externals. As Paul in \"Last Tango,\" he seems emotionally naked, pulling the character from within. It is as brave a performance as you'll ever see.",

So I felt it was only fair to go back and watch the whole thing after seeing \"The Dreamers\", and feeling that now I'm old enough to appreciate it. LTIP, beyond the butter and the anonymous sex, truly is a messed up movie. Brando's dialogue is terribly stilted and cheesy, but the performance he turns in at his dead wife's bedside is shocking and moving beyond belief. The movie is as much a condemnation of the promiscuous society as it is a celebration, and the final ten minutes are harrowing and heart-breaking. The movie suffers from 70's pacing though, where too much of the \"action\" is saved for the denouement, and all the meticulously crafted scenes before that suffer for the sake of a brutal finale. I also found the finale a tad unnecessarily moralistic - bad things happen to bad people...But Paris is beautiful, the movie is at once both intelligent and though provoking and nowadays seems less pornographic or provocative that an Britney Spears concert, although far, far more worthy of your time.",

    "review/text": "Brando is a middle-aged American whose wife has committed suicide; Schneider is a young European beauty seeking a sense of personal identity. The two meet by chance in an empty apartment--and immediately embark upon an anonymous affair in which Brando seeks to both purge and renew himself through Schneider.Both stars offer intense performances, and director Bertolucci invests the film with numerous poetic and symbolic flourishes. The cinematography is elegant; the score is quite interesting. But when everything is said and done, LAST TANGO IN PARIS is extremely thin stuff that relies on sexual shock to generate tension--and what was once shocking is now passe. At the time TANGO was made, it was unthinkable that a major Hollywood star would appear in such a film... Yet by today's standards, the nudity involved is quite mild, the sex scenes are surprisingly discreet, and the script is oddly niave. It all seems very tame.Moreover, the film's subplots slow the action to a crawl and the film as a whole has a self-concious, faintly pretentious tone. Brando and Schneider, both separately and together, offer quite a few impressive moments, but you have to wade through a lot to get to them. Is it worth it? Difficult to say. Although I don't regret having watched the film, I flatly state that I would not bother to watch it again. My recommendation: rent it before you buy it, because one viewing may be quite enough.",

    "review/text": "I'll start by explaining that this film is way before my time. But, while working my way though the \"25 most controversial movies\" I decided to watch \"Last Tango\" over a period of two days. At first, it left me confused, unimpressed, and repulsed by Brando, but not enough to stop watching. The sex really isn't the draw to this movie, it's a film that is 'adult' in the most honest sense of the word. I often find dealing with adult emotions messy, complex and contradictory, and this movie conveys that experience so well and in so many ways. The viewer is asked to confront things that go way beyond just two people having sex and talking dirty. Paul's feelings over his wife's suicide, dealing with his mother-in-law and his wife's lover would be enough to drive anyone over the edge!After just one viewing, I am not convinced this is a genuinely great film, but I do think there are some fine performances showcased here. I really found the interaction between Paul and Jeanne fascinating, not the sex, but their conversations. I found Tom and Jeanne's interactions to be snooze-worthy. I know many people don't find Jeanne's performance to be that exceptional, but I really did. She was very enchanting, innocent, but not nave.Frequently I write in my reviews here that I was not shocked or impressed by things that other people are shocked about in films. Even though, I had read enough about the movie before watching it, I will say that the infamous \"butter\" scene did surprise me a little. It's difficult to watch and there is nothing erotic about it for sure.The colours are appropriately subtle and compliment the feelings in the movie well. Some of the film is in French with English subtitles. Other parts are in English and it kind of goes back and forth. I didn't find this to be a problem. In fact the sound on the DVD I have is so low, that I almost prefer the subtitles, so I could get everything they were saying. The music tends to be a little stridently loud in places as well.In the end, I kind of got my hopes up that these two were going to \"make it work\" or that Jeanne would save him. Maybe she did in a way?",

    "review/text": "When first released, in an era far more sexually repressed than ours, this film earned so many negative reviews that most moviegoers remembered it primarily for the infamous \"butter\" scene. Today we can see more clearly what Bertolucci was up to, and we can celebrate this landmark film as it deserves to be celebrated. It is nothing short of brilliant, as many contemporary film critics now realize. Bertolucci was way ahead of his time, so much so that I wish the film could be re-released today as a brand-new film. Brando is remarkable--restrained in most scenes, volcanic in one--and his performance may well be his best work after \"Streetcar.\" The film explores a strange juncture of grief and sensuality in which a man whose wife has killed herself attempts to channel his suppressed grief in a new direction: anonymous sex with a lusty younger woman. I passionately recommend this film to all serious movie lovers. (Any doubters should Google the famous New Yorker review by Pauline Kael.)",

    "review/text": "This is a good film that still retains some of its power, but I think Bertolucci has done better, much better. I can understand the shock waves that this film caused back in 1972, especially the casting of Brando in an X rated film. It has a lot to like about it. It has great performances (especially by Brando), great cinematography by Vittorio Storaio, a great music score (an underrated part of this film), and good supporting performances. Jean Pierre Leaud is hilarious as a pretentious poser filmmaker, and Catherine Breillat, the great French filmmaker, plays the sound person in Leaud's crew. She has one line \"dogs are more faithful than people\". She might have written it herself.But I watched it recently, and while I still like a lot of it, it wasn't as shocking or as fresh the first time I saw it, which made me a little sad. I am glad, however, that Bertolucci had a hit with this, as he got to make his incredibly ambitious epic, 1900. Bertolucci has made many better films than this one, like The Conformist, 1900, and The Last Emperor. Last Tango in Paris is a good film, but it's not Bertolucci's greatest.",

Brando is simply marvelous as Paul, frightening in his intensity as this man whose life has become a black hole.

Loneliness , hopeless, desesperation, two persons existing before living each one to their own way, sharing an apartment where they can be true for a while. And surrounded by a silence`s veil. The story is told by a shy camera, who spies like a peeping tom, all the corners of the room.And that finale in the dancerroom is an antology. The huge scream of pain couldn`t be told in a more dramatic style. The tango that certainly represents the hopeless and the blooded memory of that tha could have been and wasn`t, and the contrast with the nuance and touch of class that Paris means top us, it can be too heavy and awful for many viewers. But if you are able to go beyond these estetic obstacles and exploring the deep of the soul . You`ll be rewarded forever. A landmark in the story of the cinema.

It was something totally different from anything I had ever seen, taking risks and using techniques never before used in any film I had seen. One is reminded of some of the other cinema greats -- Fellini, for example, who weren't afraid to risk ridicule for their art. The cinematography, the music, the script, were unlike anyting I had ever seen. The idea that two people could meet in an apartment in Paris and have the most intimate of relationships, yet know nothing significant about each other -- the thought of this was fascinating. Of course, all is bathed in the lurid light of the French apartment.Now that I am older and more jaded, I see this for what it is -- groundbreaking, and thus, dated. Like \"Saturday Night Live\", nothing like it had been attempted before, so it seemed better than it really is. I am sure it has been done better since. However, a few things remain untouched and absolutely stellar: 1) Brando's performance, which is incomparable in its pain and absolute believability 2) the musical score (by the great Gato Barbieri 3) the cinematography, only surpassed by Fellini.One must own this as one must own any classic.",

The mood of the film at times is light-hearted, childish, naughty, and at other times it is very sad, fatalist, and depressing - such a range of emotion is hard to find in a movie.There are so many memorable scenes in the movie - that it is almost impossible for anyone to say they completely dislike the film. Brando's performance is one of his best - and you really feel like this was a special project for him. It made me laugh when I read someone's review saying Bertolucci was a dirty old man when - he wasn't that old when he made the movie, the sex scenes are all artfully done, and I don't get the sense that he had any bad intentions in making the picture.I give this film 5 stars for its beauty (every shot looks like a painting), its range of emotion, and Brando's performance.

The scene in which his character, Paul, speaks to the body of his late wife had an immediate effect on me during my first viewing of the film: somewhat surprised, not expecting to be moved this deeply, I suddenly felt tears welling in my eyes and trickling out.

Bertolucci had begun psychoanalysis just a couple of years before and his penchant to indulge Brando seems to be a direct result of this.In retrospect much of the film's theme could be interpreted as misogynistic, there's certainly a lot of female fear aroused as a direct result of male aggression whether by Brando or Schneider's boyfriend. In fact 30 years down the line Maria Schneider has disowned this film, citing it as 'exploitative'. Nevertheless the film was considered quite bold for its time, even if what makes audiences uncomfortable about this film now is not quite the same as what made them uncomfortable 30 years ago. After feminism, Aids and the 60's backlash that was the '80's, 'Last Tango In Paris' looks shockingly naive in its view of sexual relationships. I think a lot of women today would find the Schneider character slightly embaressing in her vapid earnestness.You have to give it to Brando though, he does get a digit probing by Maria Schneider, now thats true dedication to his craft! I can't imagine a Grade A Hollywood actor of today such as Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt or Tom Hanks engaging in such thespian devotion, too much of a 'masculine' image to maintain.

    "review/text": "Paris is dirty, or at least the parts of it visited by Bertolucci's camera. The beginning of the film follows the separate paths of the two main actors(Brando, Schneider) through the streets of Paris. We've yet to meet them or learn anything about them but we can't wait til they finally do cross paths in an old run down apartment where most of the movie will take place. The cinematic style is unmistakably European and at a time when European cinema was at its very highest point. For a short time in the late sixties and early seventies film was considered on almost equal footing with literature. In fact the cinema seemed to be the perfect medium to transmit what the novel had become...experimental, non-linear, post-structural. If culture was entering into a post-verbal phase cinema seemed the obvious medium for high culture to express itself in. Antonioni's Blow-Up(based on the Cortazar story) and Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris are the most convincing examples of cinema having achieved this equal footing with literature. It didn't last long but for a few years foreign cinema produced one masterpiece after another. European cinema was at its height in 1972 and so was Marlon Brando. Bertolucci was a new director and Brando already a star but it never seems either is interfering with the others talents. They encourage and compliment each other perfectly. Brando is allowed to improvise all he wants it appears but Bertolucci is free to turn the sound down or up, or move the camera closer or further away to get just the effect he wants. They both come out looking great. It is as powerful an acting performance as exists anywhere(no other movie feels as real as this one), and it is a very pleasingly constructed piece of modern cinema. Two virtuosos practicing their craft.The story is a depressing one but its the moments when Brando departs from the script that one feels the freedom that a live performance when everything is really clicking and happening can give one. And its the perfect script for allowing such moments of departures because the character in the story needs desperately to feel free or liberated again from the confines of what life/culture has become. In their rented room Brando and Scheider explore a reality of their own making. Their room becomes a playground where no stultifying bourgeois rules exist. Ultimately the game does not shut out real life and that is the tragedy of the Brando character. As real life creeps in to their play world the game winds down and appropriately the final scenes show the characters not in their room but in public, once again in the streets where the film began. The younger Schneider just sought a momentary diversion in the affair whereas the older Brando relied on it for his very sustenance and once the game ends there is nothing else for him. Without a playmate to keep him playful he is simply desperate. Everything about this film is perfect, including the music. A long film at 128 minutes but one that impresses you again every time you see it. No other movie has the power this one has. Brando's most interesting character, and Bertolucci's most interesting/accomplished piece of film.",

Brando's character in the film feels miserable throughout, and I think I felt at least twice as miserable while watching. Even more annoying though are the laughably unconvincing scenes between Maria Schneider and Jean-Pierre L&eacute;aud, the latter of whom turns in an utter ham act. After sludging through the first hour of this film, which drags on listlessly and at a snail's pace, you find that you just don't give a damn anymore what happens. Although I can't exactly give Brando a thumbs up for taking on this role, I place the blame for this atrocity squarely on Bernardo Bertolucci, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay--having seen a bit of Bertolucci's other work as well, it seems that this guy should have his filmmaking license revoked. About the best that can be said is that the picture quality of the film really is stunning, but even that ends up not being an advantage because it just makes the whole thing seem even more annoyingly 'arty' and pretentious. \"Last Tango In Paris\" is a life-draining movie-watching experience that can't be recommended, period.",

But it was also because it was an experimental art film which showcased incredibly fine acting and the unique and the exceptional viewpoint of Bernardo Bertolucci, the writer and director. I vaguely remember seeing in when it first came out but it is only now, almost 40 years later, that I can appreciate the artistic endeavor of the filmmakers. This was a unique film in its day. It was expected to usher in a new kind of dark and explicit filmmaking but it never did. So it now it stands alone as an historical memory of an art film that upset and confused the public but never won their hearts and minds.The film is set in Paris and the language is mostly French. Marlon Brando, a middle-aged American man is grieving for his wife who has just committed suicide. Maria Schneider, then just 19 years old with the kind of fresh young beauty that pulls in the viewer in every scene she's in, first encounters Brando in a empty apartment when she is apartment hunting for her forthcoming marriage. What follows is a torrid affair with the most explicit romantic scenes ever seen in a mainstream movie at the time. Schneider is often nude and the object of Brando's rather perverted needs and these scenes are more sordid than titillating.The acting is over-the-top excellent, especially in a scene where Brando has a long monologue over the corpse of his dead wife. The script is tight and there is not a wasted word even though it is hard to see exactly where it is going. The atmosphere is melancholy, the intimate scenes strong, explicit and somewhat upsetting as Brando dominates and the willing Schneider accepts this. I was completely absorbed in it all, kept my eyes glued to the screen and quickly realized that this film is a small work of art that has been misunderstood. Time has not diminished it and it stands alone as an experiment which provoked emotions that the public was not able to handle then and probably cannot handle now.",

    "review/text": "I hadn't seen this movie since it came out in the early 70's, and I'm wondering how I sat through the thing back then. I guess it was Maria Schneider's bod that got me through the thing. Things like that matter a lot more when your hormones are gushing like some Parisian fountain instead of like a fine wine being decanted. Yes, I'm aware that that's some pretty hokey mixing of metaphors. I'm just trying to say that Mlle. Schneider was hot then, and is hot now, but it takes more than that to get a viewer through this movie these days.The good news for my fellow geezers is that, after 30 years, my memories of the movie were almost gone. It was like watching a new movie, so there's an upside to those senior moments. I stopped saying, \"I don't remember this!\" after a while.There's a lot wrong with this flick, but the core of the plot is not without interest. The main characters test each others love to the max. Timing of their actions also comes into play, and has a great deal to do with the outcome of these lover's fates. I see what the director/writer was trying to do, and if Brando had been controlled a bit more, the film wouldn't have come off as being a bit silly in so many scenes.I'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of the 2 it deserves because it's fun to watch Brando any place in the world, and Marlon Does Paris is much more fun if he wasn't in this one. I think a lot of his dialogue must have been improvised, and his choice of words gives an insight into the mind and upbringing of this Nebraska boy. I can't imagine that the Europeans came up with some of the earthy language that sounds like it came from a feed store in the good old USA rather than a Paris bistro. The soundtrack also adds another dimension. There's too much icing and not enough cake.

    "review/text": "To begin with, Last Tango in Paris is a landmark in film history, it's Bertolucci's most psychological film, and a breakthrough conventional censorship, banned for almost ten years, Last Tango is brooding and sensual, raw and miserable, Maria Schneider appears here so voluptuous and everlasting, can't blame Brando's character (Paul), to become mad, she is both a child and a woman, a combination no one can resist (your sex doesn't matter), the ultimate object of sexual Catharsis, becoming wrath. This is a chamber piece, a conceptual story in the minds of its two protagonist, enters Marlon Brando; Paul's construction couldn't be more close to Brando's psychological truth, it is his most alike character, and Brando just exudes all of his unlimited potential, skills, and mastery of the acting art, delivering one of the most perfect performances in all movie history, a must for every student of acting and for any aspiring director in much concern of his or hers actor's performance. Complex, incomprehensible, silent in sorrow and in much pain, but completely lost in a duel because of his dead wife, this is Paul, egoist, manipulative, the world moves because of him, even at his lowest hour of pathetic self indulgent anal ways, Paul is everything inside the Apartment, and nothing outside of it. Enters Maria Schneider; Jeanne a French beauty (just in her early twenties), cast in a child like role with the sweetness and seduction of a Lolita, only this time is both voluptuous and dependent of a real man's love, Schneider is just unforgettable in this seductive character, and her performance is first class, a woman of its time: unbreakable, untouchable, daggling in distress, from there to discipline, all the complicated self-destructive bound, because she's nothing, an object of animation, a subjective mannequin, beaten into submission, raping again and again.The apartment is the metaphor to their relation, un-scout even approaching the movie's end, it stands in much need of human candor, but the human condition won't let this happen, and Paul and his beauty will be forced to crash against one another, it's pure ruin and misery, and Bertolucci cages this and much more that doesn't meets the eye, with that masterful direction that only exist in the very best. Alas, it resembles the relation of a father with his daughter, with that daddy's care for her, and her Oedipus lust that can't be ignore, but doomed to die, shackled Paul's princess, Jeanne is here to carry with the burden of a long gone will to just be in comfort when the moment of excitement, that's why they don't need names inside the apartment; Frantic or Therapeutic?The photography is achieved with smooth and cold colors that only the erotic European films possessed in the 70's and 80's, Vittorio Sttoraro gives and unforgettable atmosphere to the story, he knew it by heard, and so Bertolucci, you will always remember the Tango Dance Contest Mad Scene, it is the very essential way of photography, direction, and real acting, all in one, based in a perfect and sensible raw script. The beautiful and haunting music score, adds more atmosphere and strength to the already powerful images.The DVD edition comes with an excellent transferring of the film, surely it looks as good as the day it was released, but the lack of additional material makes you want to know more about this mythical movie (the edition comes with a very illustrative eight page booklet, with inside information about the film's history, but a full length documentary would have give a much entertaining and depth view of the film), again the transferring is a fine work of good visuals and sounds, and the best of all, it is the uncut and uncensored version, as Bertolucci originally intended to be shown in Theaters back in the middle 70's, when everything was still uptight for such a film, there was no problem at all with the nude scenes, the problem was about the moral violence that the picture depicted in a way that no one had dare before to showed in the big screen, from there it came its heavily censorship, the psychological alternation of the most devastating loneliness and the filth and stink of the Human Insight Tremors, shown here with the intention to shock, not to move. Controversial still.",

The film used to be concidered for censorship. The music for the film is composed by Gato Barbieri, a musician whos roots are in the tango as he is a Latin american saxophone player and composer of the highest creative and emotional potential.

Brando is at his finest; the scene where he views his wife's body is incredibly powerful. It was Brando not acting, but being.The sex was not graphic at all by today's standards. There are very frank and uncomfortable situations portayed, and a few static shots of breasts and mons. Otherwise, the erotic impact is generated completely in the mind of the viewer.While the picture quality isn't exactly mindblowing, it was adequate. And yet, Storaro's genius shines through. Some of his best work. Fine score. I would have liked more, perhaps an interview with Brando, Bertolucci and Storaro.Of course, it's B.B.'s baby; he was way ahead of his time with this classic portrait of the darker side of human passion, loss and identity.",

    "review/text": "I found this DVD \"Las Manos\" by trawling through the local library and decided to check it out, and I'm glad I did. This story of miracle worker Padre Mario Santaleo of Argentina was fascinating. It was well-directed and I was especially impressed by the performance of Argentine-Italian actor Jorge Marrale who played Padre Mario. What a subtle and heart-felt performance! You felt that you were watching not just an brilliant actor at work, but the actual spirit of a deeply compassionate and humble man that Padre Mario was said to be.The story is that as Padre Mario exercises his uncanny gift of healing, this proves to be an embarrassment to a Church that had shunted aside its mystical side in favor of political realities. He is also persecuted by the government suspicious of the power of miracles on the people. The film shows his numerous clashes with both the Church and the government from different angles. Soon Padre Mario finds himself exiled into the countryside where he bends his energies into slowly building his chapel and healing those who come to him. Meanwhile, a cancer victim who had been healed by him earlier, a woman named Perla, devotes her life to being his assistant, which adds to the scandal. A Platonic love quickly grows between them, one that sometimes tempts them both to go further, but they refrain. This mutual restraint makes for a sweet tension between them throughout the film that seems to further energize the power of love behind the healings.There's a number of twists and turns in this film as Padre Mario attempts to get permission to perform Mass at his chapel from the Church who wants him to recant his miracles. They even send a spy, masquerading as a rebel priest, to monitor his doings. Meanwhile, Padre Mario, with single-minded purpose, tries to work through these obstacles while enduring declining health.There were a number of affecting and intriguing scenes when Padre Mario tried to explain his gift to skeptics and sometimes painfully, to himself, wondering why he was given this gift when he knew himself to be unworthy of it. In this (as throughout the whole film), the actor Jorge Marrale was superb in conveying the whimsy, the love and the anguish of a miracle worker out of step with his times which no longer tolerated miracles. Marrale's performance was stunning. I strongly recommend this film.",

    "review/text": "We Are Family is a documentary film directed by Danny Schechter, which chronicled the recording of the \"We Are Family\" benefit single and the after-effects of the September 11 tragedy. The single raised money for the We Are Family Foundation Fund, which was established to help the victims of September 11, as well as to raise money for organizations that promote tolerance. The documentary runs about an hour in length, and covers: the recording of the single (both the New York and Los Angeles recording sessions, as well as additional work with Luther Vandross and Little Steven), interviews with the participants, the press conference to announce the single, what happened on September 11, families looking for their missing loved ones, the hate crimes committed in the wake of September 11, the volunteers who helped clear the site at Ground Zero, the history of the song \"We Are Family,\" and people on the street trying to sing the song. The documentary is very well done, and combines the seriousness and the light-hearted moments without diluting the message that the film is trying to get across.Overall, the DVD itself is rather simple, and is packaged with a copy of the \"We Are Family\" charity single. The main menu of the DVD has the picture that appears on the front cover, and gives you three choices: \"The Film,\" \"Music Video,\" and \"Outtakes From The Film.\" The whole song of \"We Are Family\" plays in the background as the menu runs.The music video for \"We Are Family\" was directed by Spike Lee, and is shot in black and white. The video contains footage of both the New York and Los Angeles recording sessions, as well as Luther Vandross' solo session, and Nile Rodgers working with Little Steven on the guitar part. While the video may not be anything spectacular, its a well done video for a charity single; it really captures the vibe of the song and the recording sessions.There are four outtakes included: \"Musicians in harmony,\" \"Athletes in the family,\" \"Actors take the stage,\" and \"Making the record.\" \"Musicians in harmony\" lasts about five minutes; it includes footage from rehearsals, as well as commentary by Fred Schneider, Kate Pierson, Jeffrey Gaines, Harry Wayne Casey (from KC and the Sunshine Band), Sophie B. Hawkins, Kenny Lattimore, Chante Moore, and Tony Terry. \"Athletes in the family\" runs about two-and-a-half minutes, and includes commentary by Mark Jackson from the New York Knicks, Rod Gilbert from the New York Rangers, John McEnroe, Lisa Leslie from the Los Angeles Sparks (WNBA), and Rebecca Lobo and Teresa Witherspoon from the New York Liberty (WNBA). Nestor Torres playing a flute part in the studio is also included, and some of the audio of the flute plays in the background when some of the athletes speak. \"Actors take to the stage\" lasts about three minutes, and includes commentary from Macauley Culkin, David Hasselhoff, Milla Jovovich, Tyson Beckford, Gina Gershon, Aida Turturo, Little Steven van Zandt, and Jamie-Lynn Sigler. \"Making the record\" lasts under a minute, and has Nile Rodgers talking about Little Steven's guitar part; it also includes footage of Nile and Little Steven working on the guitar part.Overall, this is a well done music documentary. It is highly recommend for people who are interested in seeing what goes on behind the scenes of recording a song like \"We Are Family.\"",

    "review/text": "I wont go into what the movie is about because obviously you have read the other reviews and or have seen the movie itself. Six women, down into the depth of the earth. Now I am a big horror fan in my own right. I like movies that can take cliches and rework them into something interesting and phasing. This movie is one of those kind of movies. Then again, this is being shown to us by the same people who brought us Saw and Hostel--two sets of films I really don't care for because I go to a movie to be scared, not to watch torture scenes that I'm well aware of after studying such incidents as the Holocaust. But I digress. What I like about this movie is that, unlike Cave, this movie really does make you feel claustrophobic. You really do think you are down there, with the women, at least as private observers, and that what they feel you feel. Fear. Uncertainty. Anger. Distrust. I have to give the women of this film high marks. They knew how to take six women characters and really build upon them better than you would tend to think (I mean really, it seems that in most horror movies women are running around screaming blah blah blah, but in this film, they know how to fight back against each other and the monsters). The violence is visceral and nasty, but realistic and coordinated. The monsters, whatever they were, were mean and unnameable. I will be intrigued to see how this film will look when it comes out on DVD and, like so many movies, will be unrated. If you have a day off I would suggest to go out and see this film.",

    "review/text": "I love the excitement of seeing a movie the day it opens, there has been some advance buzz about \"the descent\" but not much, at least not what I've heard. several friends gather together and go \"spelunking\" [caving] and take a wrong turn into unchartered territory, after a cave-in their skills are tested often and there is real tension navigating through the series of twists and turns in the cave. but the real trouble begins when the girls meet up with human-hybrid creatures [crawlers] that are blind and move about using sound similar to a bat. the creatures aren't interested in breeding, they're looking for a meal. the girls get seperated after their first encounter with the \"crawlers\", so the confusion caused by their seperation forces them to fend for themselves and summon resources they thought they didn't have. \"the descent\" is very gory and gruesome, so if you have a weak stomach this is not for you.the caving exploration they take is meant to bring them together after one of the girls suffers a horrible tragedy. the cast was all female which was a nice change of pace from the usual all male crew we're used to seeing. of course in the process of battling the creatures, they become warriors and even resort to turning on each other during the savagery they have to endure. the end of the movie is a legacy of the movie \"carrie\", gotta leave 'em with one more shock, that I thought was completely unnecessary. but \"the descent\" is one of the better horror offerings I've seen recently after too many lame and predictable horror movies in the last few years. hopefully when \"the descent\" is released on dvd it will include the ending from the european theatrical version. an alternate ending that is much superior and shocking than the american version.",

    "review/text": "At the risk of repeating what all the other reviewers have stated, let me just say that this was as finely crafted a scarfest since the first Alien film. Writer/Director Neil Marshall is to be commended for creating a first rate horror film that, for once, doesn't rely on all the hacneyed tricks and CGI effects that have come down the pike in the last several years as well as utilizing cast of unknowns who also can't act to save their lives. This cast of unknowns are all good actors and handle their roles admirably. The score by David Julyan is the perfect accompaniment to Marshall's film and the cinematography and editing by Sam McCurdy and Jon Harris respectively combine to make this the true jewel of horror films.I normally don't purchase films of this ilk but after renting the film and getting the bejesus scared out of me I just had to own a copy. I would therefore recommend this film to anyone who enjoy their shocks and frights at high octane levels.",

    "review/text": "Just when you thought you had seen them all. Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Aliens, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Ring and now The Decent. Make no mistake about it... this horror is a bone-afide fully-fledged masterpiece that will have you on the edge of your seat well into the end credits. A group of six female buddies fronted by Juno (Natalie Mendoza) reunite to pit themselves against a forest cave only to stumble upon something exceptionally horrific, after they find themselves trapped following a rock fall. Deep underground their friendship worsens as they undergo a frantic struggle to survive. Part action, mostly horror, The Decent gets you right in there with the claustrophobia, crawling through tight spaces to suddenly unleash a bloodbath of absolute horror. When the screaming starts it does not stop and although there are many moments that I would love to review I would be doing you a great disservice to spoil any of it for you, including what is down in the caves. Take my word for it. When things get going this is the white knuckle ride you have been longing for. It is thoroughly violent and extremely upsetting for the sum of its fiendish parts. Just go watch it alone in the dark and then watch it again with your friends. You will be glad that you did. And calling this a Horror Cult Gem, means exactly what it says. This one is a keeper that can sit quite comfortably next to the best that are out there... and then some more. Don't even read past this review. Don't try and find any spoilers. Don't even bother with the trailer. Just BUY IT, watch it and give thanks to the director for reviving the horror genre with it.",

Then it tosses them into the (almost literal) meat grinder where they face monsters both inside and outside of themselves. It is rare to find a horror film that is actually horrifying, but this one hits on many levels. The director, cinematographers, editors, and cast made this tightly written story shine.",

    "review/text": "To be honest, I have no idea what gravitated me towards the Descent. I think it was because word of mouth was very kind to the film and someone mentioned that \"this is what the Cave wasn't: good\". Missing the chance to watch it in theatres thanks to shoddy management, I had to check out the film when it was released on DVD and despite all the hype I had of \"I have to see this movie\" it actually delivered for once and while it does slightly have the trapping of recent horror films, it's a quite exceptional, if not entirely original, horror movie but it's certainly a standout among the recent factory conveyor belt turnouts.Sarah and a group of friends are thrill seekers who are enjoying a white-water rafting trip but on the way back, Sarah gets in an accident which kills her husband and daughter. A year later, still grieving, she decides to get back into the game and go cave spelunking. So Sarah and her friends Juno, Sam, Rebecca, Beth and Holly go into a cave system that was actually uncharted and turns out there's a reason since something scary and threatening are in the caves looking for unfortunate travellers.In recent films like Hostel, Wolf Creek, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and prequel, even the Saw films, the emphasis as been on out-and-out carnage. Gore galore I guess you can say and there's a couple scenes where it does get gruesome but's not in a frat-boy giddyness where they're chuckling away while having an eyeball hanging from a socket. Instead the film is mainly played for atmosphere and tension for a good section of the film then the fit hits the shan and it becomes a battle movie where the creatures attack and even the girls put up a fight too. While it's easy to see where the film shifts gears (made notable by probably one of the most effective jump scares since Alien's chestburster or the Exorcist III's nurse scene). Speaking of which, hope you didn't watch the trailer since it's more effective if you never saw it.Scream in a way started this: it's been harder and harder to care for characters who get sliced or any other thing. Strangely I did find myself caring for the women that had to fight their way out. Maybe it's because the genuine opinion is that men can handle themselves so we're not as emphathic whereas with women, one casualty is one too many. As far as our \"other\" cast members, they are appropriately creepy and scary but in a weird way, they're on screen too much so the feeling of guy-in-a-suit syndrome pops up but luckily they're so effective you don't even bother thinking of it.The one fault people might find although personally I didn't mind is the length of time it takes before the creatures show up. We get extended pre-cave stuff, then cave travelling then having to figure how to get out THEN they show up. While the film actually made it so that you hoped they wouldn't show up since you cared about the women so much, viewers might get impatient. Plus there is some gory shots but they're not as detailed or well-lit as recent films so thankfully the film isn't focused on gore to provide the scare. Gore is meant to create disgust and relying on it like Hostel doesnt make it a scary movie, it just makes you go \"...eww\".Let's see how repeat viewings will hold up but by and large, this is probably one of the better horror movies I've seen without having to rent old movies or stuff from Korea.",

    "review/text": "I am not into watching body parts being tortured and cut up, so I don't have much of an appetite for shows like Hostel and Saw. I do love horror films that plays tricks on the mind and it's scary when I watch a movie like The Descent when all these women are stuck in a cave and trying to figure what the hell is hiding in the dark, and off course by the time they realized that it was a bad idea to be exploring such an unknown cave, it was too late.The cast is relatively unknown, but they are all good in their parts. The story is creepy and the atmosphere is creepier. The \"crawlers/creatures\" are even creepier, if you can imagine Gollum(L.O.T.R.) making a cameo in a low-budget horror film. Yes, the cave is very real, dark, slimey, wet, and bloody, and I almost believed it was shot in a real cave until I saw the special features. Impressive prosthetics makeups and set dec. If you think The Blair Witch project was a ripeoff, then you would appreciate something of higher production value on dealing with unknown monsters in an unescapable situation. I found myself so drawn to it that I did feel kind of stuck just like the characters, maybe it's because I am very afraid of dark caves and underwater themed stories. I wished there was an alternate ending to this film that didn't quite satisfy my at the end. Just check it out and you'll know what I mean...",

    "review/text": "This movie started off about as refreshing as you could get. Sure, there were \"Lifetime channel\" moments and such but for a horror movie at least it didnt just dump a bunch of hapless teenagers in the woods for them to be hacked one by one.The atmosphere was eerie and convincing. The cave shots were well done, the tension was building ever so slowly and it was somewhat un-nerving when you just knew that something bad was brewing. So, the first part of the movie was thumbs up all the way. Unfortunately, like sooooooo many other horror films it resorts to silly blood spatters and totally unbelievable situations and it gets old rather quickly. The creative tension that got me hooked was quickly replaced by absurdity. Too much ketchup, too many frantic scenes of the \"monster guys\" jumping around, and of course...the completely silly \"tough\" chick that Kung-Fu'ed her way through most of the monsters like they were invalids. That alone killed it.... the main characters were disposing the bad guys too easily and some of the ways they killed them was laughable. I was angry at this movie not so much because I wasted my time but because it had a lot of potential and seemed to run out of ideas so they went the \"Gorefest\" route and completely chickened out of making what could have been a classic if it was done right.Remember how perfectly the original Alien movie slowly but surely built wicked tension and it never released you from that tension? Remember how uncomfortable that movie made you feel for almost the whole running time? This film started that way.... it was very creepy and made me feel uneasy. Just like Alien. However, Alien never let up and did NOT turn into a pointless gore-fest like this movie did. Too bad, it really is.Not Recommended... but rent it, dont buy it if you have to see it",

    "review/text": "I'll be honest and say they could have cut the first 15-20 minutes out of the movie. Yes, I know they were setting up the scenario, but it wasn't really necessary and once the main part of the movie started it felt like those scenes had been cheaply and shoddily tacked on to give a completely unbelievable movie a bit of reality. Which didn't work. It's a horror flick, just start out with people getting together for whatever reason to go explore dark and scary caves on an ill-advised trip. I don't think most of the audience cares why - we came to this movie willing to suspend our disbelief, run with that.Once the adventure starts I began to like the movie more. I know it's just a shallow horror flick but there were some genuinely interesting interactions within the group. If you want to over-analyze it you could, because the reactions and actions of several of the group members were very well-done, considering the situation they found themselves in. I found myself drawn into the storyline and pulled along with the characters. The 'monsters' were good, just the right touch of frightening without being ludicrous.But then... then there was the end. And what would have been an okay movie was completely ruined by an end scene that made (at least in my mind) no sense whatsoever. I can't really say more without ruining the ending, but I can't wrap my brain around what was supposed to have happened and what the filmmakers were trying to imply with the last bit.So there was a bit of decent action-horror capped with a boring beginning and a confusing end, leaving a bad last impression. I'd say that there are far better horror movies to spend your time watching, give this one a miss.",

The claustrophobic angles and dark, nearly pitch black lighting really gave it an effect I haven't seen since Pitch Black. The creatures were well done and nearly believable, and quite frightening. I would hate to be in the caves with them. Since this was a horror/thriller, the story wasn't expected to be very dense, and the characters weren't expected to be atypical, and this is usually the fault with this genre. If you want to terrify the audience, you need to identify with the victims and get to care for them. In this film we're just barely introduced to them enough to get to know their stereotype. But all of this doesn't matter when they enter the cave system and we see the beautiful underworld. This cave has never been mapped, so this is the greatest adventure these spelunkers could hope for, until the crawlspaces collapse behind them. With no way back, they move onward looking for an exit when the dark, confined spaces start to take a toll on their minds. But being stuck under the earth is the least of their worries. I really liked how well the film was made, and how complex the story got once the action got started. I said early we didn't expect the people to be atypical, but they really developed under the pressures of darkness, flight and survival.",

Before this movie the Grudge maybe made me jump twice but this movie made me jump alot more.The story line is not bad it's got the basic story line of pretty much all cave horror movies Some people go into a cave, there are monsters in the cave and they kill the people. Although it's just incredible how they film it and the monsters actally look like something that could be real if people lived in a cave for 1000s of years of course. This is also one of the only movies that is a full women cast, except the monsters who are defently male, well their is like one female showen but tha's not my point. The women fight really hard to stay alive and are scared to death all the time with limited supplys.All in all ifyou love horror flicks and chicks with picks then you have to get this movie it's awsome!",

    "review/text": "After reading and hearing the exorbitant amount of hype for The Descent I was sure I was going to be disappointed but surprise surprise I was anything but.As another reviewer has posted, this movie is not reinventing the wheel but rather, it does a great job of displaying the wheel in a different and refreshing way.............for example:Although the actresses are not exactly going to be nominated for an academy award this is the first \"horror\" movie I can remember in a long time where they and their actions are fairly believable and not once during the movie did I say to myself/ yell at the screen \"dont do that! what are you thinking idiot!?!\" (like gee I dunno just about every horror movie made in the last 5 years including the garbage, mindless gore flicks exploiting the success of the overhyped SAW)The acting is solid for the most part, which is also a huge positive characteristic of the film since there are no \"big stars\" to anchor the film- which is completely attributal to a solid script, storyline, and character development/ representation. There is at least one actress whose character seems a bit cheesey and exagerated as some sort of adrenaline junky but then again I used to skydive so Im used to cheesey stereotypes of \"thrill-seekers\", or whatever that is supposed to mean.Another favorable attribute of the film, at least to myself, is that there is no happy, low-risk-cheesey-gutless-Hollywood-ending. The people responsible for creating this film have guts.Lots of typical horror movie cliches to satisfy fans of the genre- atmospheric and creepy colored lighting and intelligent use of the dark, roller coaster tension rides, impressive score, and what appears to be somehwat of a homage to the Shining (or not) in some of the heli shot environmnet scenes in the begining with similar foreboding music.I know many modern horror fans out there like the gore and blood but I was actually turned off by the amount which I felt dumbed down the film (I only had the option of watching the unrated) but then again I was raised on Halloween, The Shining, Jaws, a little of Friday the 13th, the Excorcist, etc. back in the day.Im not sure if this film will translate to broader success outside of the horror fanbase as I still think there is too much gore for something along the lines of a film like Aliens to become a hybrid hit but fans of the genre should eagerly attempt to see this film.",

Does have some nice moments of suspense-building, but overall not a satisfying experience.",

A five star movie this is most certainly not. I enjoyed it, but did not find it particularly scary. The movie is slow to develop and the climactic last 30-40 minutes are a lot more about blood and gore than fright. Some of the reviewers here are comparing this to Alien, which is a joke. This movie is good, but not nearly in that category if you are looking for good scares.",

    "review/text": "Lion's Gate will be remembered by history as the film studio that made detailed on-screen torture a horror genre staple, as well as educating a generation of American serial killers in the most efficient way to extract an eyeball from a living victim's face.Politics aside, their choice to release Neil Marshall's brilliant film in the US is an uncharacteristic move of good taste on their parts. But it does explain the unfortunate billing the film received in the television adverts. (\"If you liked Saw, you'll love the Descent!\")Maybe so, maybe not. But the two films don't belong in the same genre.The Descent approaches the \"Night of the Living Dead\" style of trapped victim horror movies with several fresh ideas:1.) All the main cast are female, including many roles that are usually filled by men.2.) The environment itself (the cave) is as much a villain as the monsters.3.) The monsters themselves aren't necessarily evil. They start out afraid and curious of the women, until one of the women kills a monster.It is not a slasher flick. In fact, the low budget aspect of it all brings the focus far more onto the terror than onto the mutilation.Many of the scariest parts of this movie touch on some fairly primal fears (car accidents, claustrophobia, being eaten alive), but oddly enough, it's all done more with the audience's imagination than with graphic demonstration (the sign of a good director).As for the unedited ending, I don't think it makes much of a difference either way. I saw the UK version first.",

    "review/text": "I wanted to like this film. How often do directors present their audience with an all-female cast ... let alone a cast of strong adventurous women? And the concept of using spelunking to create claustrophobia is fairly innovative (outer-space has become too common a choice ... with films as recent as Boyle'sSunshinetaking full advantage of its restrictions). And, I admittedly had to restart this DVD because I was grabbing a soda when only A MINUTE into the film, the gore began. Soooo,when I pushed the back button, I was convinced this film was going to shine ... unfortunately, it was tedious stretch of blackness (for me).Yes, this film does have several \"jump-out-of-your-skin\" moments; however, these types of thrills are short lived and fairly thoughtless. They become disappointingly predictable to the skilled viewer. And, there are occassional moments of tension (mostly as a result of good camera-work), but this is undermined by the poorly-crafted creatures (\"real \" or not). The sub-par quality of these underground-predators pulls the viewer out of the film (even if the viewer believes these are strictly hallucinations). And while the gore is well rendered, the film is so saturated with blood that one quickly becomes desensitized.Unlike many of the negative reviews of this film, I did not mind the conclusion. I've never been fond of films that neatly tie the end in a pretty bow. And the last image is perhaps its best ... it almost worked on me ... almost. (Watch the DVD with the director commentary and you will hear Marshall say that he left it open-ended for viewer interpretation ... and a potential sequel ... so there is no need for a forced-read ... which, again, is a welcome move).Maybe the biggest \"sin\" this film committed was to present a group of strong female characters and then reduce the conflict to one of romance. Exhausting. And, frankly, the director tipped his hand too early. What should have been subtle was painfully overt ... and while I could not have predicted the relatively \"bizarre\" events of the films, I easily predicted the final confrontation in the first FORTY-FIVE seconds of the film.Hey, a lot of viewers like this film ... there has to be a reason for that. The concept is genuinely innovative and the director bravely granted his film what he knew might widely be considered an \"unpopular\" ending. I respect that. But on both a visceral and intellectual level, it did not hold my attention (at all). Nonetheless, just because it failed to (even partially) engage me, does not mean it will fail for you. I see its merits ... I just believe this film is deeply flawed.Give it a try and return here to share your thoughts! And prepare for The Descent II which is currently in pre-production. However, director Neil Marshall is not returning ... though he is producing (meaning he's involved in procuring funds, some aspects of hiring, and distribution) ... and by reading the synopsis, part II might just provide that nice bow for which many are clamoring ... what a pity.)",

    "review/text": "First of all, this is definitely one of the better horror movies to come out in years. Horror movies lately just seem redundant and extremely unoriginal; TCM: The Beginning anyone?Anyways, this a movie actually worth sitting through. The best part to it is its environment. The tight spaces that the girls have to work there way through is just amazing. If you are claustrophobic, just imagine yourself crawling through them little rock tunnels and having part of the cave collapse all around you. Scary eh? The plot is pretty average. There isn't really anything special about it, but it makes for an entertaining watch. The acting is surprisingly above par for an non-All-Star cast. The movie can also be suspenseful at times, but that is mainly due to the environment in my opinion. I was kind of disappointed with the monsters. They just didn't really heighten the fright-factor to the movie at all. The one thing they did heighten was the gore factor, which is satisfying to the gore hounds. Something that I couldn't help but notice multiple times in this flick and is so redundant with lots of other horror movies as well that I am getting really tired of is the CLASH-BANG scare techniques. Can you not be any more unoriginal?But overall, despite the many minor flaws, this movie is a good watch. It is alot better than the other crapola that has been coming out the past couple years.Oh, one more thing. When jessica falls and hits her head near the end of the movie, she starts dreaming. Sorry but when you are knocked out like that, you can't dream. Dreaming occurs in REM sleep, and there is no way in Hell Jessica is sleeping. (These comments go for the French version of the movie. I don't know how the U.S version concluded.)3 1/2 stars",

These 'girls' were a freaky group and not too bright, using profanity with almost every breath. It appeared to be a primitive Luray caverns located in Virginia with the long stalegtites from the top of the caves. This one, however, has never been developed for the tourist trade and was inaccessible to the normal person. It was not like any guide book.So, what's the story now? It was an ego trip, no risk what's the point in going inside where the dark plays tricks on you. They wore miner's caps with the lights on. The leader would not admit that she was wrong, and so they had to fight the demons from Hell. The egotistical, sadistic leader will bring everything down on their heads.There was crude dialogue with profanity; no place to be polite as the women were separated. You just can't put your trust in a know-it-all who'll lead you astray into danger. One of the characters was a Lizza Minelli lookalike with lots of false eyelashes. She was the first victim after they were aware of the naked albino gholie following them. The cranberry pond turned into the killing pool. And then there were three as they fought the Cro-magnon man-beasts who were blind but always went for the juglar vein in the neck.There proved to be a serendiptious way out. There was a mercy killing, and one had to use a primitive ax-tool to protect herself. They were involved in a fierce fight for self preservation, and the leader became a real cave woman; she got what was coming to her. The one survivor had to climb a mountain of bones to the surface, and drove the van with the Michigan license plates down the muddy curving lane like a bat out of Hell. The ending was very scary.",

    "review/text": "Most people recommend \"The descent\" as an excellent terror movie, due to the fact that it manages to make a strange story believable, and because it conveys an atmosphere of paranoia and extreme fear. The actors are quite good, and writer-director Neil Marshall should be congratulated on the fact that he made a movie that scares the living lights out of the spectator.You are curious about the plot? Well, it involves six women that are old friends, and that meet in order to explore new caves, in an effort to cheer up one of them (Sarah, played by Shauna MacDonald) that has recently lost her family. However, things go horribly wrong when they get trapped in an unexplored cavern system, without maps of any kind. As if the claustrophobia factor were not enough, they will have to face the fact that they are not alone in the cave, as someone is hunting them. On top of that, one of the members of the group has a secret that could destroy her relationship with Sarah and the other women. That doesn't sound too scary, does it? Despite that, it is. You cannot stop watching, because you wish to know how the story ends, but there are times when you will feel the temptation of turning off the tv.I believe that many will love this movie, but that a lot of people will hate it. I can appreciate it as an excellent example of the horror genre, but I wouldn't rent it again. The reason is that, in my opinion, \"The descent\" is not for casual fans of horror movies. So, if you like actions movies with an ingredient of terror but are not really into scary stuff that looks too real, give \"Alien vs Predator\" a try and avoid this film. On the other hand, if you love horror movies that are extremely gruesome and you cannot detach from, you will probably love \"The descent\". It certainly wasn't my case.Belen Alcat",

True some of the gore was pretty bad (both gross bad, and unrealistic \"70's slasher\" bad at different points) but I really enjoyed this movie. Even the cheap scares were not at places where I expected them, and they didn't take up the majority of the movie. I loved the opening giving the background of the women, letting us peak into their lives and get to know them just enough to care about them once they get down there. It also gives the set up for the internet war over what really happened (SORT OF A SPOILER- were the monsters real or a figment of an insane party member's depraved mind?). My husband and I watched this while cleaning the house and I must admit... we both found ourselves standing about 3 feet from the TV just holding our cleaning supplies and watching. We eventually gave up on the cleaning until after the movie ended since it enthralled us both so much. I loved the group dynamic, and to have a horror film with excellent, realistic acting is a rarity. I LOVED it. The feel was similar to the original Alien in that it was dark, clautrophobic, and very tense. The fact that the cast members did not simply scream and give in to their grusome deaths made it even better. It's nice to see people fighting back when their lives are on the line. Is this film an academy award winner? No... but it IS a good solid horror film with excellent acting, a few good jumps, a creepy feel, a believable (monsters not included) plot, and realistic dialogue that though often funny, never sacrifices it's integrity for a laugh. I would recommend this film to just about everyone... infact I already have recommended it to several people.",

I wish today's filmmakers better understood that what the audience imagines is often more unsettling than what is shown. Given the setting of the film (underground), implied terror and mayhem were opportunities forgone to the detriment of the film.To Sum Up:The Good: Cinematography, make-up effects of primary characters.The So-So/Neutral : Story, Acting, Character development, Suspenseful air of film overall. All-female protagonist cast obvious political statement.The Bad: Heavy handed visuals (too much explicit gore, often unintentionally humorous), absurd dangers, slow plot development, film has an overall \"clumsy\" feel to it - no subtlety.Recommended?

    "review/text": "I've noticed several people who offered poor reviews on this film, and really gave little indication as to why. I can only imagine that they did not see what I saw when I watched \"The Descent\" for the first time. For everyone else who hasn't seen this film yet, I would like to contribute three suggestions to ensure a more enjoyable viewing experience.Suggestion one, if you have a short attention span, don't watch this movie! Go watch Saw, or some other fast-paced hack & slash that won't make you have to think much or feel for the characters. This movie's strength lies in strong character development, and gradual progression of suspense that takes up a good half of the film.Suggestion two, watch this movie ALONE... no friends or buddies you can pretend to be cool around by calling something lame, cheesy, or predictable. Yes, this movie has some cliche moments, but you should hardly be able to notice it if you are as fully immersed in the macabre and tense atmosphere of these dreaded caves as I was.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, use your imagination. Of course, with certain very graphic scenes, you will need to leave little to the imagination, but particularly in the first half of the movie where not much in the way of action really happens, the viewing experience hinges on YOU, the viewer. Try to really immerse yourself into the state of mind of the characters and see yourself in their world, not as some distant, impervious third party. Let down your guard a bit, and you will be surprised at what you may find. The effectiveness of this movie relies on its believability, and as you descend into this forbidding cave with these girls as your only companions, and you somehow do not feel, at least in part, their edginess, claustrophobia, despair, and pain, you will never truly appreciate their experience. Try to place yourself in the darkness, faced with having to crawl through a space barely wider than the span of your shoulders, hardly able to breath or move, and fully aware that the thousands of tons of rock above you may collapse at any moment... all this aside from the hungry, gut-ripping monsters that come onto the scene later! This is the state of mind you will need in order to truly appreciate what this movie has in store. Enjoy!!",

Taking place largely in underground caves and tunnels, that whole exotic, dangerous, world is captured in all its rocky beauty. And then, having established itself as a bona fide landmark in the craft of capturing this kind of envirornment, it injects into it a relentless horror as some of the most ghastly and yet believable monsters in moviedom begin to stalk the six spelunkers who've come exploring these seldom-seen-by-human-eyes tunnels and caverns.The six friends meet periodically for this kind of adventure, and in this case it's the first time in a while they've all been together, with the spectre of a tragic accident that occured during a white-water trek the previous year still hanging over them. Hidden tensions begin to crop up once underground, once the tunnels turn out to be more treacherous than counted on, and they're already deep and off course when some of the members of the expedition begin to suspect that they're not alone down there. Their fears are dismissed as claustrophobic delusions by other members of the group as the passages get tighter, the chasms more difficult to cross. As they try to progress, clear evidence of past explorers in these inaccessible tunnels is found, and the fear of something as yet unseen begins to increase.Gorgeously shot - with many scenes lit only by the red light of flares - and featuring universally fine performances and outstanding special effects, The Descent goes on to be even more than the sum of its parts, and is one of the best horror movies of the last few years.

    "review/text": "This British made horror film shot in Scotland is a welcome respite from the usual juvenile and embarrassingly low standard horror crud that has persistently emanated from Hollywood over the past decade and more.Although the film has its faults, at least a few fresh ideas have been injected into the genre. For a start there is an all women cast involved, and not the usual young, weak and vulnerable, screaming stereotypes, desperately seeking protection by their boyfriends from the hostilities they face. These young women are tough, self-reliant individuals, well beyond adolescence, who enjoy physical outdoor pursuits, in this case caving. There is plenty of tension created throughout the film to keep the viewer fully occupied, as an adventure that unfolds in a subterranean environment goes horribly wrong. The audience can feel the sense of dread and despondency that the girls are experiencing, once they become trapped underground. As if unable to find your way out isn't scary enough, there is the additional small problem of coping with deadly, aggressive creature that dwell within these caves, lurking in the darkness waiting to pounce on you. A nightmare scenario indeed.The relationship between two of the central characters, Juno and Sarah has an important bearing within the film. I was never too sure whether Juno considered Sarah as a close friend, or looked upon her with contempt. Being the team leader it becomes clear Juno deliberately misleads the group placing them into immediate danger from the start. It suggests to me that Juno is something of a psychopath, although this is not apparent to begin with.Like nearly all horror films, The Descent relies on certain well worn clich&eacute;s, not least the `boo factor' which is certainly overused in the film even before the group ever reach the caves, and is rather unnecessary. There are also the usual acts of stupidity, particularly by Holly, who for no special reason suddenly breaks ahead of the group in a rush only to stumble over a precipice in the dark cave, falling and smashing her knee in the process. As she was supposed to be the experienced pot-holer in the group, her act seemed absurd. The idea of including monsters in the cave is a dubious one. Being thwarted by not finding your way out of the cave with an injured party is a horrifying ordeal in itself. However they add to the terror and give the excuse for plenty of gore and `boo jobs' as necks are ripped open by these extreme aggressors. The creature effects are well done if rather hobbit-like in appearance.The unpredictable ending of the film is a clever idea as well as an enigma, but it is a refreshing change from the 'safe and happily ever after' scenario used in so many Hollywood films. It forces the viewer to pause for a moment, but eventually leaves little doubt as to what actually happened regarding Sarah's fate.As far as contemporary horror films go, The Descent ranks well above average, especially considering it was made on a small budget. The acting performances are surprisingly good for a horror film, and it is a definite viewing for fans of the genre.",

I don't know - there was just something off about it to me.The actresses were good, that being said. I like the whole underground exploration - unknown caves - all-women spelunking crew scenario. The camera work was great. Made me feel like I was right there (not a good thing at all since I am very claustrophobic).Good monsters for the most part, although I saw just one female. Did I miss others? No wonder these grubmen were upset - no grubwomen. That could put you in a bad mood.Gee, do we think there was enough blood, guts and gore? Are people becoming desensitized? Even half the amount would have been sufficient for me.All in all, a pretty good monster flick, better than I expected.",

I felt just like she did...like she was running out of air and was going to die there. The director successfully captured the panicky feeling of claustrophobic.The story is interesting (it deals with both betrayal and big egos) and really didn't need any cave creatures, IMO. However, the cave creatures will appease those who crave gore (when these creatures attack, they attack ferociously) and for those who crave fast-paced action (when these creatures attack, they attack quickly and move fast).I like that these are strong women fighting in this movie. When the creatures attack, these women fight back hard.What I didn't like about this movie was both the beginning and the ending.Although the very first scene is shocking, after that scene, it takes a long time before anything interesting happens. And there's no feeling of completion at the end. The ending is really up to you, I guess.Another problem was that because the cave is dark, it's hard to tell who is who...especially since two of the characters have straight blonde hair.But other than that, a very entertaining and scary movie.",

Small downsides: the women start appearing whiny after a while (understandable, but still annoying), and amid all the eventual screaming at one another for this or that I completely missed a few plot revelations mentioned in these reviews, the main one being that apparently one of the girls betrayed another one in a big way sometime in the recent past. Maybe I was just tired when I watched it. Anyway, I still liked the movie a lot, especially appreciating the way it successfully juggled both subtle, creepy scares and outright horrific moments. It did both well and knew which types of scares to employ when. And speaking of subtle and creepy, be sure to get the \"original unrated cut\", as it ends the movie on a more subtle and disturbing note that works much better than the ending attached to the truncated American cut. Artful subtlety can be very scary, too, after all. Decent DVD extras add further value to this taut little gem.",

    "review/text": "Too many mainstream american horror films, I've discovered over the last few years, seem to suffer from a severe lack of character development and by-the-numbers predictability. It truly amazes me to therefore read so many negative reviews that accuse Neil Marshall of the same pratfalls when, in all honesty, he has crafted a film that so very clearly goes against the shopworn grain.When I initially caught \"The Descent\" two years ago in Los Angeles, I was immediately enamored by the straightforwardly grim approach to the material. There was, much to my immediate relief, no unnecessary humor, cheesy one-liners, or MTV Top-40 soundtrack to be found anywhere. And the characters, contrary to some rather recent and incredibly erroneous claims, were not underdeveloped. Marshall fleshed each of these six women out just well enough to make me want to invest in their fates. I bought into their interpersonal relationships and I think that, along with the admittedly unapologetic bloodshed that was called for within the screenplay, actually helped elevate this film to a higher echelon.When I consider the watered-down PG-13 dreck, such as the fairly new \"Prom Night\" remake, that Hollywood lately seems to revel in cranking out assembly-line style, it makes savoring rare diamonds-in-the-rough like \"The Descent\" all the more enjoyable. This is a horror film that truly deserves to be called horror. It's easily light years ahead of \"The Cave\" and every other similarly themed rip-off that found its way to a movie screen that year.",

Well, now that I've finally gotten around to seeing Neil Marshall's (Dog Soldiers, the upcoming Doomsday) bloody and incredibly frightening flick, and let me tell you, believe every bit of the hype that has surrounded it. The story involves six female friends, going on their annual battle against nature by spelunking in a remote cave in the Appalachian mountains. Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) had lost her husband and daughter the year before, and her survivalist friend Juno (Natalie Mendoza) harbors a secret. After they get cut off underground, they all soon discover that they aren't alone, and are being hunted by crawling, nocturnal fiends. While the film doesn't sound all that promising from reading its premise alone, The Descent ends up being one of the best pure and original horror films in the last few years. Marshall creates an incredibly claustrophobic atmosphere, while pouring on the shocks and gore to boot. The acting is great, and the film's climax and final images nearly elevate it above its horror roots. All in all, I'm sorry that I missed out on The Decent for as long as I did, and if you have too and have been craving a smart, original horror film that just isn't another torture fest, then you need to check out The Descent ASAP.",

So what does that mean? I love this movie. Most horror movies either make me laugh or entertain me in ways that's almost like I was watching an episode of Barney, but this one is different. It seemed realistic. Not that there's probably something Gollum-like rolling around in your local cave, but the idea of cave exploring doesn't sound completely far-fetched, or like something you could never go out and experience. Losing your equipment while exploring? Possible. A tiny earthquake that was enough to shift rocks and block an entrance? Ditto. It wasn't as though there was some spaceship flying around in the cave snatching up the hooks and equipment needed to make it from one end of the cave to the other.The HOLY CRAP SHOCK moments are completely realistic and really do leave you feeling HOLY CRAP SHOCK. I loved the gore, too. There's nothing better than Gollum taking bites out of your body, or people falling from ledges and breaking bones. I suppose it also helps that none of these ladies were really super well known, so it wasn't all \"hey, look at that 50-time Oscar winner climbing rocks!\" Check it out, especially for Halloween!Also, even though the difference is slight, I love and prefer the unrated version.",

    "review/text": "Truth be told, I should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and I think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively. When this thing gets going, though, The Descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status, and on top of all the incredible special effects, oppressive atmosphere, and grievous bloodletting (made with a pretty limited budget, by the way), one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner. Are you kidding me? Blood, gore, a claustrophobic atmosphere like you wouldn't believe - and subtlety? How could I not give The Descent five stars?So you've got these young British women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky, extreme activity. White water rafting, for example. Everyone has fun, but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), forever. Still recovering from her terrible loss, Sarah joins her friend Beth (Alex Reid) in America, where mutual friend Juno (Natalie Mendoza), an Alpha Female if there ever was one, has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored. Joining in the fun are Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), Juno's new gung-ho sidekick, and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet.The movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the Appalachians (apparently somewhere in the North Carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the UK), then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure. Once they descend into the cave system, though, things start getting more intense fairly quickly. Their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal, especially for Sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses. That's when Juno, a woman with more than her fair share of secrets, admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before, supposedly to help reunite the group. Well, it does just the opposite, but they just have to keep going. If there is a way out, they're going to have to find it the hard way.Things are already creepy enough at this point. The filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets, making the viewer feel as if he/she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters. Just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight, dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic. But the real fun was just about to begin. In the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you'll ever want to squirm through, Sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them. No one believes her - at first. When the \"crawlers\" attack, though, all hell breaks loose two miles under ground. These Gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind, albino humanoids who hunt by sound, can scamper and climb like monkeys, move unbelievably quickly, and really tear into whatever flesh they can find. Not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves, the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light. And when the girls fight back, it's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy, bloody, gruesome department. And even as characters are fighting for their lives, a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher.The ending is a little controversial because American theatrical audiences didn't get to see the true final scene of the film, for some pretty questionable reasons. A few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference. Don't worry, though, as the DVD has both endings available.The Descent draws deeply from the well of man's most instinctual fears, making it one of the most atmospheric, heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while. The subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between Sarah and Juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here. The Descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that. If you care the first thing about horror, you must see this atmospheric tour de force.",

    "review/text": "I'll come to the bottom line first and say that, overall, this is an excellent horror movie. The gist is that six women decide to take their yearly adventure spelunking in an Appalacian cave only their group leader decides to take them to an unexplored, unmapped cave rather than the \"cakewalk\" that they were expecting. Naturally a cave-in ensues and the women are trapped, trying to find their way out. As if that weren't bad enough, the cavern is home to a horde of hungry meat-eating humanoids (think Golem from LoTR, only not nearly so timid).On the plus side of this movie, the actresses all do an excellent job and, if it weren't a horror movie, these performances likely would have all gotten attention from the Oscars and such (perhaps they did, I don't watch the Oscars but I don't remember hearing anything about this movie). This is an odd horror movie in that character development really drives the movie rather than the plot (28 Days Later is perhaps the movie that seemed to have a similar feel in that regard to my recollection).This movie has some of the same problems too, as 28 Days Later, particularly regarding a relatively flimsy plot that requires some suspension of disbelief. The acting is so good that you won't likely notice it unless you think about it. For instance, the women, after being trapped, quickly realize that other humans have been down in the cave before them (they find a 100 year old pitton). Although obviously these previous humans never made it out alive, the women at one point start following arrows the previous group had left behind (why would you follow the arrows left behind by another group who died in the cave?). The women also find some reasonably recent looking cave drawings that include a rhino (in the Appalacians?)....the humanoid monsters also present some significant logical problems. They're plenty scary, but a little thought makes you wonder how they ever survived in that cavern. They're blind, which makes sense, and apparently hunt using hearing. Although it seems their hearing isn't any better than humans. They apparently don't use it to hone in on prey like bats (despite what one character suggests) since they don't notice any of the women when they're 2 feet away as long as the women remain quiet (apparently their hearing is not so good that they can hear breathing). For the same reason it's clear they don't use sent, or apparently even notice when they're touching a human (several of these scenes are added in for suspense but are cliche and only make the monsters look like idiots). Despite sharp teeth and claws, the monsters also seem rather weak. Although the women in the movie are well built, the critters clearly have less strength than the women do, and it's only the sheer number of monsters that make them a threat. And how tenatious they are. Apparently these critters never figure out that the women are pretty lethal and that easier prey could be had elsewhere.The other big negative of the movie is simply that, like any movie that takes place in the dark, it's sometimes just hard to see what's going on. Although this oppressive darkness is meant to add to the sense of claustrophobia, it ultimately makes for annoying viewing.That having been said, this movie is still a good viewing, and if you can suspent your disbelief a bit, does manage to be reasonably intense. But it's the fine acting and production that makes the movie worth watching.",

I'm entertained by lots of the gory, splatter films that have recently dominated the box office. Usually, however, it's a matter of accepting the limitations within these films and getting whatever enjoyment you can out of the scenarios. It's been a very long time since I thought of a current horror movie as a 5 star event, so nothing could have surprised me more than \"The Descent.\"The preliminary setup is a good one. Our heroines begin to explore some unknown, uncharted cave systems and quickly become trapped. Now our ladies must use their resourcefulness and intelligence to try to get out. The dynamics start to play out between the women--good and bad--and a real fear for survival starts to set in. We are squarely in a man versus nature psychological thriller atmosphere. It recalls for me \"Open Water\"--a film whose horror is about helplessness and being stranded, not about sharks.But just as soon as I was sure where I was headed, the rug was pulled out. The last third becomes a monstrously bloody battle for survival. It is so well choreographed, I was sucked in wholeheartedly. And far from being victims--our heroines exhibit intelligence, brutality, resilience, loyalty and a real survival instinct. We've got some real female empowerment going on! For pure horror, this film goes out with a real bang.I was completely blindsided by this one. There's a good screenplay, a credible backstory, appealing actresses, great cinematography and nice effects.\"The Descent\" may not be the \"best\" movie I see this year--but as a pure adrenaline rush, I promise you it will be one of my favorites.

Even with all the mostly dry & un-original remakes out there,the last 8-9 years has still produced some of the best horror films ever & \"The Descent\" is truly the final seal of approval that we horror movie fans will look back at the turn of the century as a great era in horror movie history let alone movie history in general. If I'm Alive 20 years from now I will be so glad to say I saw this one in the theatre.

This film has been hyped up by critics of all people as one of the scariest films in the past years and that to me says a lot. I've been so disappointed lately with the slump in genuine horror films that I had all but given up in really finding a worthy scare...that was until I heard about 'The Descent'. Granted, there have been horror films of late that have proven to be watchable, to be intense and at times, yes even a little scary, but nothing that had my skin crawling. I wanted to feel trapped, helpless and alone. I can honestly say that throughout the majority of this film that is how I felt, even though the theater was packed and my brother was sitting right next to me.'The Descent' centers on a group of women who enjoy pushing themselves to the limit. The movie opens with three of them, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), Beth (Alex Reid) and Juno (Natalie Mendoza) rafting down some rapids while Sarah's husband and daughter watch in amazement. These girls are fearless...until tragedy strikes in the form of a freak accident that takes the life of Sarah's family. A year later the three girls meet again for their yearly adventure, this time in the Appellation Mountains for some caving. They meet up with three other girls, sisters Sam (MyAnna Buring) and Rebecca (Saskia Mulder) and new addition Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), all of whom we have a few minutes to get to know, and then they're off. Juno is the leader of the group, she called the group together for their adventure and she serves as their guide. The only problem is she's not much of a guide being that she doesn't know the cave's they enter.Soon after entering these unknown, uncharted and undiscovered caves the girls become trapped when their point of entry caves in. Without a map these girls have to find their way out, find another exit by burrowing deeper into the cave. This fills the viewer with a sense of claustrophobia that doesn't go away until the credits role. The monsters haven't even shown up and you're already on edge. Everything around these girls is foreign to them, is a potential danger. They are forced to push themselves as far as they can go, to the point of wanting to give up for everything looks helpless. The viewer is also forced to feel this way. I had what I wanted. I felt trapped as they did, I felt helpless as they did, and once the creatures show up, and in a rush of panic the girls separate...I felt alone as they did.From the moment the crawlers show up the movie takes a frantic turn from increasingly creepy and atmospheric to intense and horrific as these girls fight to survive, let alone escape. As intentions are revealed between the girls it also makes things all the more horrifying for you don't know who to trust. If you can't trust anyone then you truly are alone. The pace doesn't let up once the creatures are on the screen, and your heart won't stop racing either. As some of the critics have pointed out, this is a truly horrific film with images that won't leave you anytime soon, and yes, while I was able to sleep alright and didn't toss and turn in fear I was haunted by what I saw. This is not a film for the squeamish, that's a fact not an opinion. Neil Marshall did a brilliant job directing this film, giving it the raw edge that true horror films need, giving it not only jump scenes with blood and gore but building a layer, a foundation of fear before the first drop of blood is shed. And the actresses need to be commended for proving to be believable as well as likable, never 'over-acting' but giving us the feel that this is really happening and that these women are really that petrified (as I'm sure even the manliest of men would be in that given situation). Amazing job all the way around without much of a single drawback.I do say 'without much' and I only say that because of the ending. Now I've seen the US version so I can't speak for the UK version that has a different ending I hear. The US ending, while not horrible, leaves you wondering what is really going on. I have my ideas, that of which I won't share so as not to spoil anything, but I will say that it reminded me a bit of the way I felt after watching 'The Ring'. The only drawback to that film was that the ending didn't answer any of our questions, it just added to the confusion. I felt that way after watching 'The Descent'...confused...but it's not really enough to harp on. The movie does enough redeeming work BEFORE the ending that it's easily forgiven.",

    "review/text": "So this was a rather interesting film. I'd say that it was probably one of the most enjoyable films that I've seen in recent weeks. It provided an interesting location, mind-bending ending, and a unique cast of all females that react reasonably in the face of danger. What else really made the grade for this film?Plot: Ok, so it's not the most original plot I've ever heard of. A bunch of girls go caving, and lurking in the darkness is an evolved human, evolved to live perfectly in the dark. Cavemen gone crazy more-or-less. Still, the plot might lack some ingenuity, but they brought it out in a way that seems to master this form of the story. I've seen other cave movies before, but they weren't put together like this one was. In fact, they did a good job of explaining almost every aspect of the adventure in a true, realistic manner. You felt like the character had no choice and made responsible efforts in their quest to survive. The ending is somewhat of a give and take piece, it lets your imagination run for a bit, as it's more symbolic rather than direct, so you'll have to take away your own thoughts of the film, but I think that this makes it leave a lasting impression.Atmosphere: So this was another thing that I enjoyed. This movie boasts some excellent camera work. If you're at all claustrophobic, this movie will probably scare the h\"ll out of you. They did a great job using the darkness and lighting the scenes effectively and mysteriously. They also used red flares, and green glow sticks in specific sequences, which gave a nice stylized look to the overall film.Effects: There was quite a bit of gore in the film...some of it better than others. I noticed a few scenes where the gore was just amateurish, and yet there were many scenes where it was really well done. A production schedule glitch? I don't know, but I would've loved to see the whole thing with a mastering of these effects. I think though that what they do provide over-rides the less-than incredible gore, and I think most gore fans will be pleased with the quality of the effects.Acting: There's a lot of new faces, at least new as in the sense of the American market. I've not heard of these British actresses before. They did a most excellent job, and really lost control on this production. It seems like they knew exactly how to react and the director did a great job of bringing out the emotion of the scene. It was a most realistic and reasonable ride throughout the film. I think that the females were \"friends\" off-set, because it really shows through in the film.This is a definite recommendation, and a film that I will add to my collection in the near future. I think that it was interesting, fun, creative, and it really keeps you going from beginning to end. It's got a good amount of suspense, tension and gore. In my opinion, it should make any horror film fan happy.",

You do a lot of adventurous stuff that usually includes mostly just your girlfriends.After a year's hiatus due to a terrible family tragedy, you decide it's time to hook up with your girls and shake the bad memories on a spelunking outing.You head to a remote area of the Appalachian Mountains to some charted caves recommended by a spelunking guide, according to one of your group members. You embark with 6 friends into the caves from the highpoint in the mountain...down...down...down through the bowels of the mountain in search of an exit at a lower point.Then two of a plethora of bad things happen. A tunnel that you came through is sealed off leaving you only one way to go...down. And your partner reveals the reality that a guide didn't recommend the caves at all; she thought it would make the excursion more adventurous in unexplored caves. There is no charted way out.Think that's a problem? How about shining your light down the next tunnel where you see an eerie human-ish looking figure crouched in the dark peering back at you?The Descent has chills. There's high suspense. It goes without saying that there are good old fashioned jump-out-of-the-dark scares (they are in a cave!). No special effects needed here to generate excitement. The creatures are well designed and scary.The story flows very well. The acting is better than the average Horror flick. And Director Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers) keeps a better than average flow of twists and turns coming.Do indeed see it if you're into the genre.",

    "review/summary": "Neil Marshall proves that Dog Soldiers wasn't a fluke and that he is here to stay",
    "review/text": "Neil Marshall's follow-up to his cult-favorite werewolf film, Dog Soldiers, has finally arrived in the US. The Descent doesn't disappoint and I must say that Marshall's filmmaking skills have dramatically improved since the last time he's made and released a film. The Descent marks another notch on the resurgence of the horror genre's return to its darker, meaner and exploitative past when filmmakers weren't shy about pushing the boundaries.The film begins with a tragedy that strikes at the heart of one of the women in the film. Sarah's (played by Shauna MacDonald) tragic losses in the initial beginnings of the film becomes the emotional and psychological foundation that gives The Descent its emotional heft. It turns Marshall's film from just your typical survival-horror film into one about interesting female group dynamics and the measures people would take in order to survive. The rest of the cast appear pretty quickly. There's Sarah's friend Beth (played by Alex Reid) who accompanies Sarah to the US at the invitation of their American friend Juno (played by the hot Natalie Mendoza). This trio of friends are soon joined the trio of Holly (Nora Jane-Noonan) and a pair of sisters in Sam (MyAnna Buring) and Becca (Saskia Mulder). With Juno taking lead in what was to be a bonding weekend for all the ladies, The Descent gradually brings about a heavy sense of dread that something is amiss not just at the activity they're about to engage in but in the group dynamics within the female group.The six ladies undertake a spelunking expedition in a cave system in the Appalachian Mountains (already the film takes its first nod of homage to another great film about survival, Deliverance). The outdoor scenes in the woods was actually shot in the forests of Scotland, but one could never guess and Marshall doesn't linger overmuch in the bright, airy and safe outdoors. Juno soon leads her all-female spelunkers deep into the cave. Their descent into the darkening and gradually oppresive depths of the cave system takes abit longer than necessary, but just when the film was about to become a rehash of Cliffhanger, things suddenly become claustrophobic and the sense that every moment these ladies continue their descent the closer they put themselves into the arms of their inevitable doom.Things go from bad to worse in a cave-in scene that's sure to make those with problems of claustrophobia to close their eyes tightly and cover their ears. Except for a few slightly fake looking cave in rocks and debris, this cave-in scene will get hearts pumping and nerves racing. The scene is shot in a very up-close and intimate fashion that the audience has no choice but to feel as if they're trapped in that barely there tunnel as it begins to collapse around Sarah and Juno. Once the scene is over the ladies soon find themselves cut-off from the only exit they know. One could almost see panic begin to set-in, nerves fray and tempers simmer on the participants. Juno, already established as the alpha-female of the group, continues to take charge of the situation but already her reckless and infectious bravado in the beginning of the film becomes more of a thin veneer hiding a personality that uses such traits to hide a much more duplicitous and cowardly persona.From this moment of the film until the very final shot (well for the American version at least and more on that later), The Descent takes the meaning of oppresive claustrophobia and magnifies it to the nth degree. Gone are the daylight and open air of the outside forest. Even the upper levels of the cave would be a welcome sight for its stalactites and rock formations glittering from excess water runoff reflecting ambient light. Their descent deeper into the cavern system truly seems like a descent into that primordial fear everyone has since their earliest years: the fear of the dark and the unknown. Then to compound those primordial fears, Marshall adds in the internal conflict and discovered betrayals and secrets within the group dynamic. Its bad enough that these ladies have to contend with the terror of the surrounding darkness and what might dwell in its absence of light, but now personal baggage and secrets puts a new degree of danger to their chances of survival. Steel Magnolias this female-bonding film it is not.Neil Marshall and his cinematographer, Sam McCurdy, really play with the senses and fears of not just the audience but of the characters trapped in the dark with only a dwindling supply of glowsticks and batteries for their flashlights. The scenes which evokes some of the biggest moments of fright and horror shows nothing on the screen but a blackened, lightless sequence. These scenes impact in terms of horror were compounded by Marshall's excellent use of sound and its effect in confined, lightless spaces. The audience might not see whats going on in the scene, but we sure could hear every panting, panicky breath, random trickling of water that gives an impression of blind, water torture, and unknown rustles of movement that seem to come in from every direction. The Descent makes great use of the surround sound system in the theater. I noticed more than a few times people looking up and around the theater wondering if the sound is coming from those directions.The boogeyman, or men (and thats using the term very loosely), don't make an appearance until almost halfway through the film, but the first look the audience get of the Crawlers is bound to give some viewers nightmakes for days to come. The Crawlers themselves were not fully explained and they're barely seen until the very final reel of the film. Marshall's decision to let the claustrophobia and disorienting darkness hint more than show in the early stages of their fight against the Crawlers was pivotal one since it kept the monstrous visage of the creatures from becoming overly familiar too soon. Marshall gives us hints of whats stalking the ladies and lets the audiences' fevered imagination make up the rest. Once the Crawlers are seen abit more fully they're appearance and behavior do not fail whatever imagined concepts the viewer made. These creatures are fast, vicious and more than abit hungry. The scenes where the Crawlers wreak bloody havoc on Sarah, Juno and the rest of the gang will delight and satisfy fans of gore while making those not used to them quesy to their stomach. Marshall doesn't go overboard with the gore, but he does shoot and choreograph the violence in an almost lyrical fashion. He's also made the characters fleshed out enough that the audience wants them to survive and cheer whenever they fight back with a modicum of success.The Descent is such a refreshing, albeit one that's also terrifying and pulse-pounding, horror film. It takes the recent resurgence of extreme horror, or goreror as some have called it, but keeps the balance between primal terror and gory disgust. Marshall does a fine job of keeping the story from descending too much into the realm of extreme exploitation. The exploitative nature of the film's violence is still there, but it never becomes so much as to desensitize and turn away the people its trying to scare and entertain. The film doesn't bring anything new to the genre. The premise has been done in films such as Alien and Predator. The look of the film once the group is trapped underground even has hints of Argento as Marshall and McCurdy make great use of lighting in an attempt to pierce the solid darkness of the cave.The last couple years have given fans of the horror genre quite a good list of very good to great films heralding the return of horror to its very hard rated-R roots. Its a place that has been neglected too long by Hollywood and filmmakers, in general. Now we have The Descent to continue building on what films like The Devil's Rejects and The Hills Have Eyes, and to a lesser degree, Hostel and the Saw series, have begun in giving the fans of the horror genre what they truly want. What we really want are horror films that are not just about atmosphere and mood lighting, but also one that's brutal, nerve-wracking, and adrenaline-pumping. Horror was meant to be in the realm of R and NC-17 and not in the sissified level of PG-13. Neil Marshall has proven that his cult-classic Dog Soldiers was not a fluke. He has shown with The Descent that he's more than able to join the ranks of the new crop of horror auteurs like Rob Zombie and Alejandre Aja. Here's to hoping that Marshall continues to make great horror films.",

The film is a departure from the clutter of junk horror films that have been released over the past few years by not merely infiltrating you with just startle scenes. The sheer fear factor of being trapped hundreds of feet below ground with the prospect of death at every turn is simply the cornerstone of the aural terror you feel throughout most of the film.The Blu-ray presentation is immaculate from the reference quality video to the PCM 6.1 lossless audio track that is amazingly immersive.

    "review/text": "In the tired genre of Scream and Dimension type film crapola and Saw run-on nonsense that saturates the market in its entirety, it was a remarkable surprise to witness the true realism in a film that is anything but. Using all females in every lead role was certainly refreshing and I think it worked. As a whole, I think most movie lovers can't be frightened anymore, everything is used up, everything is wasted, tried, re-tried, tired, and regurgatated. That said, I wasn't scared with The Descent, and safe to say nor was I terriried in any aspect, but the movie delivers for stunning special effects. The scenes in the belly of carcasses and pools of blood and remains was truly remarkable and very finely done indeed. The monsters were keen, but not shrewd, nor new in any aspect. I wont give anything away if you are reading this, (and most likely you aren't), but the scene at the end had me actually sitting up rooting her on, jibbering and squiggling in my seat. That rarely has happened since seeing E.T. in the theatres when the bad men are chasing after Henry Thomas and friends on their BMX's.What really got me into the film, was really believing that I was actually crawling through the small chunnels with the broads, and for what it's worth, isn't that what cinema is supposed to do to us: transport us away from reality and into the surreal.On one other sidenote, A. Sandoc's comment that there were hints of Asia Argento in the film, is a bit ridiculous.",

First of all, anyone who has EVER spelunked knows that you do not enter a cave without a map. Perhaps if you're some kind of professional adventurer and have the tools, support personnel, and the resources perhaps. However, this group of women certainly did not fit the bill. The characters were not well-developed, as some other reviewers would have you believe. They basically each seemed to fit into the stereotypical \"group of gals\" roles, when you were given any kind of glimpse into their personas. Really the only characters that were at all developed was the main character and Juno (the idiot that lead her friends, unknown to them, into an unknown cave system), and the both of them barely at that. All we really know about the groups is that they're women, Juno is something of an adventurer and probably had an affair with the main character's husband, and the main character's husband was tragically killed shortly after the group's last adventure.Once we get into the cave the movie starts to take off...if that's what you want to call it. Yeah, they did a good job with the camera work and lighting, lending a sense of claustraphobia. The 'monsters' in the film really didn't go very far instilling fear into the viewer. The big mistake they made was in showing the enemy. In a movie like this, what you don't know is more scary than what you do know. Unfortunately, they didn't leave you with this fear of the unknown for long. After a short time, I found myself hoping for the ladies' deaths to come quick so that the film would end. I won't ruin the ending, but many of you will be saying, \"What?\" when the 'twist' is revealed. Fortunately, I rented this movie on NetFlix, so I lost out on nothing more than an hour and a half of my time.",

Maybe the ten minutes of actual action at the end made people forget about the 90 minutes of BORE you had to sit through until that point. This movie was stupid and boring. Maybe I was not as impressed because I watched this movie the same day I watched SAW IV. Now THAT movie is scary, and NOT boring.",

    "review/text": "Frankly, this movie was o.k at best. It's nothing to stand up and cheer, or rant and rave about. It's not some grand piece of cinema that's gonna make an impact on the world. It's not outstanding or a masterpiece. It doesn't have any superb actors to brag about. Nor, does it has any stunning special effects or cinematography. Frankly, I don't see what all the rave reviews are about, but I guess it's a matter of taste in this case, and this movie did leave a bad taste in my mouth. I really don't know what this movie was trying to prove besides the main characters could fight. True enough, they were women, and they were tough, but I'm not impressed by that becuase so are plenty other female leading ladies. This movie is just the female empowered version of \"The Cave\" with Cole Hauser. Only it's not as good, and it's a helluva lot bloodier. At least in \"The Cave\" they tried to explain to you what happened, and how those \"cave monsters\" became those \"cave monsters\", but this movie doesn't even do that. I hate it when they just throw me into the deep end of the movie without showing me how they got to that point first. I still have too many unanswered questions. Like, what the hell were those things? That's what I wanted to know more than anything, but they never explained it. How did they get down there? Afterall, were they mutated humans?, were they parasites?, were they aliens? I'm sorry, but I didn't just wanna see \"cave monsters\" flying and jumping around in the dark like acrobats without any kind of explaination. I mean, for all I know they could've been \"pod people\", \"body snatchers\" or \"seed people\". I know that might seem like a stretch, but this whole movie is a stretch. For me, the ending was just a teaser. What the hell was that about? Were they trying to say that the only survivor that we thought made it out of the cave didn't really get away, but she only dreamed she got away. Don't even get me started on the fact that they started leaving each other for dead. Why were these girls friends again? At any rate, needless to say, I wasn't impressed, nor did I like anything about this movie. Then again, this is just an opinion, and we all know what they are like.",

    "review/text": "My wife and I had a rare opportunity to find a babysitter and head out to a Sunday movie. Not knowing what was out, we began exploring ratings and reviews on Amazon and Google. While not in the mood for a horror movie, we decided to see The Descent anyway, simply because it was rated extremely high compared to everything else.So, with popcorn in hand, we rolled past previews and into The Descent.The Descent is a story of a British woman and her group of friends who enjoy extreme adventures such as rafting on rapids, rock climbing, and even base jumping. After a tragedy, the reunite in the Appalachian mountains to explore a cave. It is here that the frights begin.Without giving away spoilers, I will mention some aspects of The Descent that my wife and I discussed in the car after the movie.First and foremost, we were surprised at how much blood and gore was in the film. It wasn't needed, and many times felt out of place. The blood and gore became very distracting. We both feltit was over the edge and took away from the story. Blood isn't scary in and of itself, and after a while it loses its shock value.Secondly, there were too many cheap frights in the movie. By this I mean unexpected scenes meant to stop your heart that come out of the blue and really have nothing to do with the plot. The beginning and ending of The Descent feature scenes like this. (and no, they were black cats jumping out of shadows)Third, while the acting was good, the characters were forgettable. One month from now I won't remember either the actors or their characters.That brings me to the fourth point: while entertaining, The Descent was forgettable. My wife and I agreed strongly on this point. In a year from now we most likely will be browsing the video stores and come across The Descent. I can hear the words now, \"Did we see that? I can't remember? Was that the movie...\"Spoiler alert....Lastly, the ending was out of place. The main character does something to another character that wrecked the film for us. Earlier in the film, Juno is under attack and swings arounf wildly, only the land a climbing pick that goes all the way through another characters throat. That character can't speak, and drops to the group. While on the group, blood pours from this character's would at a fast and furious pace. There is a scene where you can literally see the blood pouring to the ground at a shocking rate. The stream from the wound is about an half inch thick. In any case, Juno leaves her for dead. My wife and I didn't blame her. This woman was toast with that kind of blood loss.But, alas, the woman didn't die and is still doing OK twenty minutes later in the film. Can you say hokey? I knew you could. Juno is then left for dead by the main character. The main character comes off as a bigger fool that Juno. At least Juno didn't kill on purpose.And then the main character fleas, only to give us another part deux of the cheesy ending: a heart stopper in the getaway vehicle. The end of the Descent contained two scenes that were out of place and ruined the movie for us. Nuff said.The movie was scary, the acting good, the story was pretty good, but the directing and the fleshing out of the characters in the script left us happy to ascend from The Descent.It is worth seeing, but my wife and I both agreed:1) We would not see it again2) We would not buy it on DVD3) We would be hesitant to recommend it to many of our friendsTotal Score (out of 100) = 4820 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.7 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?8 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?8 (out of 10). Intangibles.

The first half of the movie is scarier than the rest, because it involves a group of six women exploring a dangerous underground cave. Being extremely claustrophobic, that alone was scary enough for me! However, then the women start being hunted by evil Gollum-like creatures who live deep within the cave, and the film takes a turn for the worse. If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably enjoy \"The Descent\" because it's gruesome and relatively scary, unlike most of the ridiculous films that currently pepper this film genre. However, if you're like me and don't care much for these type of movies at all, definitely skip this one.",

    "review/text": "Slasher films are a dime-a-dozen. HALLOWEEN. NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. The list is lengthy. Some of them introduce new characters that send goose bumps up our backs. Others tread over old material and put a fresh spin on them. But THE DESCENT doesn't do any of that.Comically labeled as \"Six Chicks With Picks,\" this cave exploration thriller has the obligatory fright scenes (you know the kind ...where something weird suddenly and loudly burst toward screen), the attractive die-off cast, and themes trodden over time and again (from ALIENS to the horrible film THE CAVE.)For some reason this flick has gotten several positive reviews by professional film critics, but I fail to see why. There's nothing original. Nothing that lingers after watching it. No truly memorable cast members.That we're supposed to sympathize with Sarah (Shauna Mcdonald), the main character, is rammed down our throats (and through her husband's head) when a car accident takes Sarah's family from her. A year later, a group of girlfriends get together to go spelunking and to try and heal the wounds left by the death of Sarah's husband and child. There's a touch of deceit going on as Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) was obviously having an affair with Sarah's husband before the accident. Whether Sarah knows of this or not is up for interpretation.As the group of six descend into the cave we quickly learn that this is an unexplored hole. And when a cave-in happens, they're forced to find another way out. But with them in the caverns is something pale and insidious (think about the Morlocks from THE TIME MACHINE and you won't be far off). But are they really there? Is it possible that Sarah's had a meltdown and only imagined seeing these creatures?It isn't the question of Sarah's sanity that'll put you off The Descent, but rather the ho-hum attitude most will have after seeing the film. It just doesn't have any emotional impact. You don't care whether these gals live or get their stomachs ripped open.The filming is also very dark and it's often difficult to see what exactly is going on. Although caves are dark and difficult to see in, this doesn't necessarily translate well to an entertaining movie experience.Still, those with a fear of enclosed spaces will probably be pretty freaked out by The Descent. The claustrophobia is easily felt, and when you add to that some bizarre ghost-like creatures with Spiderman-like crawling abilities, some might find this a lightly entertaining creep-fest.",

    "review/text": "I really wanted to like this movie but The Descent was a huge predictable bore snorefest. We have six women unknowingly going off into uncharted caves thanks to their egotistic leader who decides the map book isn't necessary. Throw in the predictable rockslide which traps them inside a cave infested with half human blood thirsty creatures and we watch as the women get devoured. However, before this happens we have to sit through a good 40 minutes of character development and cheap scares. BOO! Someone jumps out at someone else and laughs. BAM! A swarm of bats rush out of a cave. BOING! A pipe bursts through a window, skewering someone but wait they wake up and it's just a dream. The soundtrack was annoying and absolutely inappropriate, rising string sections and orchestrations do not set a creepy or scary mood and the tragic accident in the beginning really had nothing to do with the overall story. It was a cheap way to throw in some blood and set up the fact that one character was sleeping with the others husband (which explains what she does in the end) but was it necessary? No, and don't worry this little snippet of information does not ruin the movie in anyway, shape or form. It succeeds in doing that on its own. The Descent is rife with clich&eacute;s (I saw the end coming a mile away), inconsistencies and improbabilities. My friend I saw this with jumped at every canned scare as I laughed and shook my head. The gore is good for those gorehounds out there but overall the entire film falls flat on its hopeful face. Checkout out the website for the real ending used in Europe which was cut out for the American release because we like our happy endings, don't we?

    "review/text": "Thanks to a nerdy childhood, some uncreative bullies, and a gym locker, I have grown up with a mild case of claustrophobia. Thanks to a Baptist minister father and an upbringing replete with information on the Forces of Darkness, I have also grown up with a (possibly unhealthy) fascination of dark and unknowable creatures. On top of all of this, I like women. Hence, THE DESCENT, a film about a group of women who go spelunking in caves filled with nasty beasties is (ideally) right up my alley.The basic story I've already pretty much summarized, although I neglected to mention that one of the women lost her husband and child a year before the cave dive, a detail that gains and loses importance depending on how you choose to interpret the film's dreary head-scratcher of a conclusion. As the women battle with the creepy crawlies (and each other) in their search for a way out, their sanity (and the story) rapidly begins to fray.After puzzling over the film's final moments, I came up with an interpretation that I thought was sound, albeit disappointing. I visited discussion boards on both Amazon and IMDB to see what other explanations were being tossed around by viewers, and what I discovered was that the movie has so many avenues for interpretation, it's difficult to argue that any one of them are more or less valid than the other. The point being that even the director has said there are multiple ways to view the film.That sort of approach work quite well for dramas and even comedies, but in my opinion, psychological thrillers need some hedges around their possibilities, or else what you have falls prey to the old and dull It Was All A Dream cop-out. That's not exactly what you have here (I don't think so, anyways), but the end result is similar: why watch a film if you can argue that the entire thing is nothing but an artfully constructed fantasy?At times it is scary, and it is often grotesque. The creatures are well-done and the acting is great (the women, at times, are at least as scary as the cave cannibals), but without some kind of anchor in reality, the movie is little more than a bunch of \"Boos!\" and blood and a whole lot of confusion. If you like quizzical endings and open-ended plot questions, then I suggest you descend into the madness of DESCENT. Or you could just get some school bullies to trap you in a gym locker for an hour or so.",

    "review/text": "A group of attractive, thrill-seeking European women gather at a remote Appalachian cabin for some female bonding. In their midst is Sarah who suffered a tragic loss one year earlier. In order to cheer her up, they go cave exploring. One of the women, Juno, deceives them into venturing into an unexplored cave system in the hopes of naming it. Unfortunately, they are trapped underground by an earthquake. Not only do they discover a new cave system, but they also discover the bloodthirsty, savage humanoids that have evolved there. Will thy survive long enough to find an exit?\"The Descent\" is tense, claustrophobic horror. A feeling of dread suffocated my heart as I watched those poor women scramble through narrow, unlit passages while hideous creatures lurked all around them. It was a demonic nightmare world and I felt as though I had also been plunged headlong into it. \"The Descent\" does for caves what \"Jaws\" did for the ocean. I won't be going inside a cave for a long time unless it has railings and well-lit concrete pathways.\"The Descent\" was very realistic and plausible. Blind fish have been found living inside underground lakes. I've seen them myself at \"The Lost Sea\" in Sweetwater, Tennessee. Its conceivable that pale, blind humanoids could also evolve inside unexplored, inaccessible caverns.The acting is superb. Great performances are given by all. The ending is very downbeat and chilling - just like the ones I relished in the seventies. Gorehounds will love this one; blood and glistening internal organs abound as victims are literally fed upon while still alive. There is plenty of non-stop action as the women fight tooth and nail in order to survive the mutant onslaught. Has this been made into a video game? It should.\"The Descent\" is a must see for all lovers of action adventure and horror. It is not for the squeamish. If you enjoyed \"the Cave\" and \"The Cavern,\" then you will definitely want to see \"The Descent\" - a descent into pure Hell.",

I mean, the cover depicts a woman emerging from a pool of blood! That screams \"torture-porn,\" doesn't it?But I was intrigued. Not by the thought that it may resemble the aforementioned horrid movies, but by the fact that Joss Whedon--creator of cult shows like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"--had recommended the flick. Anyone that knows Joss Whedon knows that the man is big on female empowerment, and that he often speaks out strongly about torture-porn movies like the sickening \"Captivity.\" The fact that he had given praise to THIS movie made me second-guess my first impression, given to me by the admittedly misleading cover.This movie was great. Gory? Yes, there was gore. But the gore was in service of the story--the horror--not just to show some people getting killed. All the characters are developed in the beginning, centering the drama of the film around one woman who is trying to overcome a tragic event that has happened to this family. That, plus some claustrophobic scenes, add a bit of psychological terror to this thriller, spicing up what would become--about halfway through the flick--a story about women fighting back, taking their nasty situation by the horns.While anyone who did enjoy--God help them--the \"Saw\" or \"Hostel\" movies will certainly find this movie entertaining, all those who abhorred those movies--myself included--will find this damn near inspirational story (though the ending is a bit of a come-down, though it serves the story well) a breath of fresh air in the horror genre.8/10",

    "review/text": "The Descent is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and it never loses its effect. It has great character development and special fx, is extremely suspenseful, and is downright scary for the most part. The acting is great, the storyline believable, and the characters themselves are very smart in that they are really tough women who make smart decisions. Also, if you are chlaustrophobic like me, this movie will really tap a nerve.The Descent is basically about a group of women who are thrill-seekers. They enjoy things like white river rafting and rock climbing, etc. On the way back from a river rafting trip, the main character is in a car accident that kills her husband and baby. Very gory. The film picks up a few years later when that same character is strong enough to join back with her friends for another adventure; this time cave exploration. This is where the character devlopment arc really begins and the movie really takes off.I found this movie to be very similar to the film \"From Dusk Til Dawn\" in that the first half of the movie is really different from the second half. In From Dusk Til Dawn, the first act is basically a hostage/run from the police/chase movie, while the second half is a vampire survival movie.In The Descent, the first half of the movie is basically about this group of girls getting lost in an underground cave and trying to find a way out. Very suspenceful, keeps you on the edge of your seat and is very realistic. As the movie progresses one almost forgets that the film is really about underground cannabilistic cave dwelling monsters. The first time you see these creatures is one of the scariest moments in a movie I can recall. I've watched this movie with several people, and they all JUMPED during this scene. It really is terrifying as is the majority of the movie.Once this happens, the girls realize they are surrounded by these creatures and all hell breaks loose. The rest of the film is basically about the girls fighting for their lives, with some twists thrown in. This film concludes with a great ending. I recommend The Descent with the highest praise possible. This is a must see! One of the greatest horror movies I've seen. (And I've seen a TON)",

I was kind of surprised I had not heard more about it previous to my renting it. It had good acting, good story, good effects, and good music. In fact I would have given it five stars if the ending had not left me wondering what happened. I don't like weird guess what happened endings. Better yet I like at least one person to survive any horror movies. To me that gives reason to have some hope during the whole horror of what the group endures. This ending made it look like no one survived, and a couple of people did the unforgivable crippling of others. One accidentally but one on purpose because of jealousy. At any rate that I can stomach. I just think at least one should have escaped the cave. Making a dream sequence like one did is clever, but not the answer. I recommend this as a rental, I can't say as I would buy it because of the ending. I liked it when Jamie Lee Curtis got away from Michael in John Carpenter's Halloween. That's the way I like them. Scary, but with someone escaping. If you like everyone to die, then this movie is right up your alley.",

    "review/text": "When `The Descent' was released I had heard all the hype, I had read all the reviews and so I was dying to see it, but I truly had no idea all that I was really in for. Have you ever watched a film that nestled so far beneath the surface of your skin that even when things aren't outright horrific you still find yourself shaking in anticipation of all that is bound to go wrong? That is the feeling I got when watching this film for the first time. This feeling is owed in large part to the breathtaking direction on the part of Neil Marshall who just went for it here, throwing caution to the wind and delivering a brutally heart racing horror film. The one thing that will stick with you though throughout the whole of `The Descent' is the feeling of hopelessness, and I think that is due to the setting. Having this horror film take place below the depths of the Earth was a brilliant, and I mean brilliant, idea. Not only are we in fear of the `crawlers' but the audience is able to share in the claustrophobic feelings of those in the film.There are scenes within this film where I literally felt as though I couldn't breathe.The film opens with a tragic accident. Friends Sarah, Beth and Juno have been rafting down rapids while Sarah's husband and daughter hang back and watch. Upon their departure home though, tragedy strikes and both Sarah's husband and daughter are killed. The movie then jumps forward a year and we meet up with the three women again. This time they are accompanied by three other women, sisters Sam and Rebecca and newcomer Holly. They have met in the Appellation Mountains for a caving trip. We are given a few moments to get to know our cast of women before they set off and descend down a cave. Juno has appointed herself the guide since the trip was her idea, but unbeknownst to the group Juno has taken it upon herself to lead them into a cave that has never been charted, a decision that proves disastrous.Upon their entry the audience can immediately feel the tension. Your skin starts to tighten and your breath gets short as you contemplate the feelings of confined closure. It reminds me of the feeling I got the first time I watched `Jaws', that creepy crawling sensation that ran across your legs as you imagined what you couldn't see gnawing at your skin from beneath the depths of the water. It's that fear of the unknown, the unseen horrors that prove the most effective. Soon after descent the group finds themselves trapped as their point of entry caves in.This sense of hopelessness only intensifies when the girls get their first sighting of the `crawlers'. I expected the `crawlers' since the trailer gave many a hint to their presence but what I didn't expect was to be afraid of so much more than just some creatures. The `crawlers' are in fact horrifying to encounter. They are disturbing to the sight and deadly to the touch. What makes their presence even more disturbing is the setting. I keep coming back to the fact that they are confined underground for a reason. I deeply feel that if the setting were more open, like say the woods or something, the fear would be less extensive. When you can barely move, let alone run, and you can see no further than a few feet ahead of you, let alone behind you, then any and everything becomes all the more terrifying.Another major plus to the film is the acting. The cast of actresses are strong, neither of them resorting to overacting, which is a problem very common in this breed of horror film. Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza (who play Sarah and Juno) are especially effective here, but the entire cast is well rounded and balanced. As a part of the cast (so to speak) Neil Marshall makes his presence known with such flare in the director's seat. He layers his film, setting the perfect foundation of terror so that the audience can become absorbed in this horror masterpiece.`The Descent' is brilliantly crafted and masterfully delivered, a truly horrific film that makes for one of the most engaging and rewarding times at the movies last year. `The Descent' breaks my top ten of the year, maybe even my top five (I have to revisit this year a little more closely) and is a film that I will recommend till the day I die. If you are tired of the onslaught of generic and ridiculously `unscary' horror films that seem to dominate the box office then you are in for a treat for `The Descent' will chill your bones and boil your blood. It's about time we get what we pay for.",

The plot is this (without giving too much away): five daredevil females go cave exploring in an unchartered cave and discover, or rather are discovered, by something heretofore unknown.The women are physically strong, fit, prepared. They are experienced thrill seekers. I like the fact that there are no dumb, helpless female moments. At no time did I find myself rolling my eyes and thinking, \"This woman is too stupid to live. Why doesn't she just die already.\" Throughout the movie I was rooting for each woman's survival. These women are damn tough and they know what they're doing! The actresses are all thoroughly convincing in their roles, especially when the element of fear is introduced. The women's individual reactions is probably the most frightening aspect of all, so convincing do the actresses portray their characters.The only element of the movie I found disappointing was that Juno's betrayal of Sarah was not more dramatically pronounced. You really have to pay attention to appreciate this twist.I absolutely LOVE the ending. It is unusual and totally unexpected. The final moments are nothing short of poignant.If you want to be scared and thoroughly entertained, please watch this movie. You won't be disappointed!",

And the women are competent human beings, by and large, who are not present in the movie solely to trip, fall and get rescued by men. The cast can act, again something that is not altogether common in the genre. And the film is shot beautifully, both outside and inside the cave. Undoubtedly the cave was shot on a soundstage with entire walls of the cave chamber missing, but you really get an idea of claustrophobia. It's hard to effectively light a movie that is supposed to take place underground without making it look harsh, or providing too much ambient light, but the lighting people succeed admirably.However, the ending is a cheat, as far as I'm concerned, and knocks a star off what I would have given it otherwise. I won't spoil it for you. Maybe you'll like it, but I thought it really invalidated most of the film. In some respects, \"The Descent\" is similar to \"Silent Hill\" - another horror movie with female protagonists, gorgeous cinematography, good acting, but script and ending problems. If you liked \"Silent Hill\", you'll probably like this, and vice versa.Still, problems aside, \"The Descent\" at least worth a rent if you like horror films.",

Simple effects, but they work indeed! And \"The Descent\" is as dark as the underworld itself. You'll understand when you see it (I persume).I had my hopes for perhaps a bigger adrenaline-ending (it's not the highlight of the movie I must add), but you'll probably jump in your seat anyway all the way to where the credits begin to roll. But it lets down a promising masterpiece from being a complete one (in my book that is).Are you a horror-fan you really must see this movie!",

    "review/text": "With its nods to Deliverance and explicit allusions to Carrie, this all girl film plays out the possible ramifications of 70s action, science fiction films (Alien), and horror films (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) when there are only final girls. In both endings there appears to be no way out: once you get through the bloody mess of delivery, you 're just going to be eaten alive by \"bloody\" Life. the cave, at turns bloody, dusty, and a tight fit (\"push.. forward\" is aline of dialogue), the film seems to rework the dysfunctional relationship between mother and daughter in Carrie into a sisterly relationship between woman giving birth and her mid-wife friends. There's a \"we're not Laura Croft\" line at the beginning, but the macha (Sp? of feminine macho--machette?) or maybe just butch Burt Reynoldsish character turns out to be a bad sister and delivers her friends into the claws and biting mouths of fiends, all of whom look like the National Inquirer's bat boy, To its credit, the film refuses to sort out the gender confusion it introduces, and the dead are forgotten or their memory the occasion of a meaningless revenge. A good soundtrack.",

    "review/text": "The Descent is from the same director as Dog Soldiers and interestingly features an all-female cast as opposed to Dog Soldiers which has an (almost) all male cast.Six friends get together for a \"holiday\" exploring a cave as a way of getting over the death of one of the friends' daughters. However, as usual in the genre things go wrong and they end up trapped in the cave with no map. At first their main concern is finding another exit from the cave and fighting the paranoia and claustrophobia that the dark, dank conditions of the cave create, but then they discover that that they are not alone in the cave, and the company has a taste for blood...The first fourty-five minutes of the movie is about charactor-development and building up suspence, which I think was very well done. The second part of the movie is all about action and gore, which is also very well done. This movie manages to have very well crafted horror and suspence as well as gorey deaths and buckets of blood. Few movies have been able to combine the two aspects of the horror genre as well as The Descent has.This movie is similar to the directors previous movie, Dog Soldiers and to another movie called Creep. It also had aspects of The Cave.The Descent is a suspenceful, gorey and origional horror movie and definatly one of my favourite post-2000 movies. I would certainly reccomend The Descent to any fans of the horror genre, or anybody looking for a good movie. This is horror at its best.",

As if that would make what went before it somehow better. The directors cut means he took a new cut with a new ending of the profits if you ask me.This movie will be available in large quantities in the bargain bin very soon.

However, the biggest thing that I have against this film is the lighting or lack thereof. Think about it. This film is set deep inside a cave. There is no light except for the torches and flares of the main characters. That means that a lot of the time it is impossible or, at the very least, extremely difficult, to figure out what is going on, and believe me, staring at a dark screen for an extended period of time is BORING! Perhaps if I could have seen what was going on I might have found this film as frightening as other reviewers claim it to be.",

Was I supposed to care about these women or just watch them all die and hope I find the death scenes enjoyable? And exactly how many centuries would it take for humans to become bat like is beyond me, but I don't think it would have happened just yet. And how strong are these things? They can take down large game and wolves but a 110 pound woman can take out 4 of them at the same time? Whatever. The deleted scenes are horrible and deserved to be deleted, maybe they should have deleted the whole movie. I gave it 2 stars just because the movie was somewhat watchable until the end. What the hell was that anyway? If it would have ended with the dream getaway I would have said it was a bad movie, but the actual ending made me dislike it even more. I say you should waste less of your time and get the Cave instead. I even liked Dog Soliders, what happened?",

    "review/text": "Are you scared?This is yet another episode of \"How to Frighten Audiences With Loud, Unexpected Noises\" ... except, by now, we can see them coming from a mile away.Certainly, The Descent was full of promise -- a stunning accident leaves a woman alone, shattered. She's a risk-taker, a spelunker, together with a group of female friends who like edging up close to death and feeling the thrill. But, with the accident, she apparently folds up, and her friends don't stick around to help.And so, sometime later, these \"friends\" agree to draw her out with an exciting new adventure -- caving in the depths of Appalachia. Maybe, they figure, the danger and excitement will reignite their friendships, and maybe their friend's life.And so, down we go into this gaping hole of a cave, deeper and deeper into the Earth ... and maybe the subconscious. Monsters of the Id and all that.But, if that sounds provocative, rest assured that The Descent is nothing more than a spoiled opportunity ... a half-baked, half-executed, and never more than spottily realized exercise. Sure, the cinematography is first rate, filled with interesting angles and colors. The cave scenes are spooky, and the claustrophobic moments work.But, sadly, we have a director who thinks that jarring and unexpected noises are the most profound way to frighten an audience ... and that if you introduce an undiscovered race of demonoid creatures, an audience will suspend all disbelief ... and that a horror movie can survive even if all of its human characters are entirely unsympathetic, and many downright unlikable.In the end, The Descent is a film version of a roller coaster ride. Sure, the crazy spins and falls will get teenagers (and maybe a few adults) to scream and cheer, but those looking for a good story and some genuine scares will likely be disappointed, particularly with what could have been.",

I love creature films and indications were this would be a good-budget, well acted change from the cheesy norm.It has a fantastic 1/2 hour, that being the last 1/2 hour. Until then it's little more than a National Geographic caving episode with a few cautious over-the-shoulder glances from a character or two thrown in, and creepier music. Although some scenes may have you nibble a fingernail or two, it's more because of some spelunking challenge than any genuine sense of dread building toward the attacks you know are coming.I give it credit for having a female cast that doesn't sit around and cry, stand and scream, or trip every time they try to run. Good performances of strong, no-nonsense women here and all the better for it.But we're back to that last 1/2 hour thing. Once it leaves the realm of the Discovery Channel and finally turns into a horror movie, Descent becomes a real thrill. But even that last 1/2 hour is killed by a total downer of an ending. I mean, not every movie has to have a happy happy joy joy ending, but the last 2 minutes were just a roll-your-eyes groaner.Big letdown.",

    "review/text": "Actually, I gave this movie 3 1/2 stars, but for the benefit of the doubt used 4 instead of lowering it to just 3. WARNING: Jeff Long wrote a fantastic book called 'The Descent'. When I first heard of this movie I thought at last they had made the book into a movie. Wrong. The only things the book and the movie have in common are the name and something creepy underground.Six women, Sarah, Juno, Beth, Rebecca, Sam and Holly, love get togethers that include extreme adventures, such as white water rafting. The ladies haven't gotten together since Sarah lost her family in a car accident. Now, several months later, they're ready to take off again, this time on a deep cave spelunking adventure. After venturing into the cave, crawling through an amazingly tight tunnel which collapses behind them, Juno admits she didn't bring the map because this isn't the cave everyone thought they were exploring. It's a new, unexplored cave, one where they could have made a name for themselves by exploring. The problem now becomes finding a way out.Deeper and deeper they go, until they come upon a chamber filled with bones. Here they meet an unexpected welcoming party, a group of ghastly albino beings who see humans as simply another source of food. The girls fight off the beasts, get separated, get re-united, and all the while the body count begins to pile up.'The Descent' is a good horror flick with plenty of gory eye gouging and head slicing to feed your taste for blood, but at the same time is a bit formulaic. Another problem is that although its being filmed in a dark cave, the fights are too dark, too fast, and choppily edited making the best parts far too hard to see and follow. There are still some scenes that will make you jump out of your seat, and a few surprises in the script that keeps this film from being just another splatter film. Rent first. Enjoy!",

    "review/text": "Neill Marshal gave British horror flicks a bite in the arm with his funny and thrilling Zulu-with-werewolves flick Dog Soldiers, but he ain't joking in The Descent. Unlike overhyped, undernourished recent local efforts like glorified TV pilot 28 Days Later, this is a real movie made by someone who knows exactly what he's doing, and who does it well. More importantly, he's not afraid to take his time to ground the story and the characters before getting to the main course. There are a couple of hokey false alarms before his heroines find themselves trapped in an unexplored cave system, but the first two thirds are a pretty good survival story in their own right, making you wonder if he really needs to give the gals company down there: big mistake, because when they finally do meet the locals, the film shifts into high gear that makes Cameron and Sigourney look like wimps. Aside from some terrific action scenes, Marshall even manages to subvert the expected it's-not-really-the-ending ending, turning it from the usually schlocky clich&eacute; into something that is genuinely haunting. Which is a shame for those of who saw it theatrically Stateside, because that ending can only be found on the unrated special edition (it's only the last minute that's been cut, but that's enough to leave you with the standard one-size-fits-all horror movie ending). Still, I suppose we should be grateful at least that Lion's Gate didn't retitle it Mountain-Pick Chicks in the Cannibal Cave of Death....",

    "review/text": "How far down will you allow yourself to go in order to survive? That is what the title of this excellent film refers to.I'll try to be brief. This is the most intensely scary movie I have ever seen. I did not see it in theater; I had to pause the DVD three times while watching to get up, leave the room and try to scrape up the courage (shouldn't use the word 'guts' here!) to finish this film. I'm talking intense on the level of the 'last supper' scene in Ridley Scott's \"Alien\", only fleshed out to full feature-length. Aside from the film itself, what I find truly amazing - from the 'Making Of' documentary - is that, aside from a few exteriors, the entire thing was filmed on a soundstage. This movie has the most realistic cave settings I've ever seen in a movie, and there weren't very many elements actually used to put them together. That, and the fact that although it's set in West Virginia - which has, of course, the world's highest concentration of inbred, subterranean human mutants - it was filmed entirely in Great Britain. Make sure to get the uncut version with the extended ending, which was cut for the U.S. theatrical release. After nearly two hours of near-ridiculous suspense and horror, the end of this film will break your heart.Later Note: Hmmm, maybe it WAS North Carolina. I still think my comment about West Virginia is correct!Slightly Earlier Later Note: The scariest moment in the film for me had nothing to do with blood, guts or the crawlers. Sarah is squeezing through the tightest of tight passages, gets stuck and suffers a moment of claustrophobia, accompanied by a memory of her daughter (I hope I'm remembering this correctly). Juno(?) comes back to help her and it's all VERY intense and then the roof shifts! I was so drawn in to the moment - by a very talented director - that it was as if I were down there with them watching it all happen.So much for being brief. I can't say enough good about this film, but, one more time, be warned: this is an intensely (have I used that word enough yet?) frightening movie and it is definitely not for everyone. Your girlfriend may not like you any more if you make her watch it! (My wife refuses to see it.)",

What are you stupid?\" The greatest thing about this movie is there isn't too much of that! This movie features great character development of 6 women who know their stuff. They are all adventurers and use endless amounts of resources and problem-solving and still find themselves in deep. Each of the characters has a well-defined background and different personality and they act accordingly. The special effects are incredible and the psychological aspect throughout leaves room for speculation and interpetation from the viewer. There's some interesting nudges at some horror classics along the way: The Shining, Jacob's Ladder to name a couple. Love this movie... and I have a sudden interest in caves... hmmm.... but a warning to the viewer; if you are looking for non-stop blood like \"Final Destination\" this movie isn't for you.

    "review/text": "With an unknown cast the makes their performance memorable and the most clostrophobic of caverns, the monsters are just an added bonus to this well above average horror flick. Originality plays the biggest part of the film, pitting a group of females into the deepest of an unexplored cave in the Appalachian mountains. The incredibly creepy monsters, utter darkness, and fantastic camera work add just as much too.Though it's the cave creatures that are supposed to give the Descent its extreme scary horror, I actually found the caves themselves to be just as horrifying. This isn't too be watched lightly for those who suffer from clostrophobia. Thumbs up to the director for making this come to life, giving us the feel of being right in the middle of the cave climbing action. And I must not place too much emphasis on \"climbing\", for most of the time it seemed that there was more falling taking place. The first half of the film focuses on the caving alone, but the horror already begins there as the group of ladies fine themselves lost, stuck, and even injured.When the monsters make their entrance it is truly frightening as well. Because the cave is so dark, the only means of light for the girls are either their flashlights, lighters, or infrared via camcorder - which gives the film a Blair Witch Project feel at times too. Thus also begins the complete bloodfest that this film goes into, with each monster making a mess out of one of the ladies or vice versa. It becomes the ultimate means of survival - not only are the ladies trying to escape these creatures, but trying to find their way out of the caves as well. And as an added bonus, there is even a bit of drama between some of the ladies, with an added twist.I expected much from this movie and that's what I got, even a bit more. The monster scare and blood was just what I was expecting, but the camera work and sense of enclosed space was more than I had hoped. This turned out to be a truly frightful experience, and each time I watch it always gets to me. Just like Jaws kept so many out of the water, this is bound to keep you out of the caves.Acting - 4Characters - 4Horror - 5Story - 4Overall - 4.5",

It takes only a few scenes to hook the viewer.Three thrill-seeking women are white water rafter, enjoying life. Just as a little tension is building, and a concept is forming, tragedy strikes. The tension that was there, or at least hinted at, is all but gone. But it sets up the rest of the movie.Wanting to get over the tragedy, the women gather together one year later to renew their adventurous side. The threesome meets three other women for the weekend thrill of caving. With no real experience, the women take off for a crazy, and dark adventure. Trouble ensues.As expected, several aspects of the movie are present: caving, shock scare scenes, a cave in, darkness adding to the eerie aura, injuries, deaths, and the use of all sorts of caving gear used in assorted fashions.As the women make their way through the caves, they soon encounter their cave-dwelling antagonist. The movie takes a quick turn to scarytown, and the action really picks up. Anyone wanting a fair share of blood, guts, and mutilation will love the action sequences in this movie.Genuine terror and shock, along with a creepy foe, makes for a delightfully evil and well made scary movie. There is, however, one downfall: the ending.The ending to \"The Descent\" is possibly one of the worst movie endings of all time. 95% of the movie is exactly as desired, and then the end is sloppy. The resolution is not there, and it's nowhere near as expected. A sure-fire ending, one that is already known, isn't a good thing, but neither is the total opposite. As with most things, moderation is the key. And the ending to this movie is not moderate by any means. If it weren't for the ending, I would have probably given a 4 or 5 star rating.",

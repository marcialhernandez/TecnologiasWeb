    "review/text": "There's nothing more to say about this concert DVD, except that it totally stinked! I mean it did not capture my interest or even my excitement in buying it. The only saving grace for buying it is that it's a music material from Janet Jackson, which unfortunately, I happen to collect. God, she is much more better in her albums, which of course are recorded and remastered (thanks to modern technology in music preservation).I tried to watch the DVD, but only after a couple of minutes, i felt irritated and so annoyed, just by looking at the over-all production. I just thought that Madonna's singing was terrible. Janet's was even worse. At least Madonna's voice has certain clarity and character for each of her songs. Janet, on the other hand, despite her great hits (I really do like her songs), boringly sings with her monotonous thin and weak voice, like in this concert. Worst of all, she lip-synched the songs! Maybe she is already having difficulties in singing as a result of her nose job.The concept of the concert is somehow copied from Madonna's Girlie Show Tour of 1993. In fact, Janet's unconsciously trying to be Madonna in terms of artistry. Sorry Janet, you still need the guts and inventiveness to be like the true Queen of Pop.And my advice to all is, before saying Janet Jackson concerts are the best, you should watch first the Madonna concerts. You're missing a lot in making intelligent judgements. As for the DVD, well... it's not a smash but rather a trash.",

There are one or two obvious omissions in terms of personnel, but with the perennial legal issues surrounding the Buddy Holly legacy, that is not surprising. The stories told by some of the participants are very familiar, but they lose nothing in the re-telling and others add valuable new glosses. To this reader, the most unexpectedly interesting is Charles Bunch, now no longer with us but here describing eloquently what it meant to be asked to play drums behind Buddy Holly. All in all, a welcome addition to any Buddy Holly/Crickets addict's collection. My one criticism is the misleading way Amazon lists the DVD: it is NOT by Jerry Allison - he is simply one of many contributors.The Real Buddy Holly Story",

    "review/summary": "PUSH HANDS TUTELAGE",
    "review/text": "This DVD combines two VHS tapes that were titled Taiji Pushing Hands 1 and Taiji Pushing Hands 2. I own both of the VHS tapes, having purchased them when they were first released. As I've mentioned in other reviews, I have always been satisfied after purchasing martial arts DVDs of material that I already had previously purchased in the VHS format. Besides the advantages of easy access when using a DVD, Dr. Yang, Jwing Ming usually includes a fair amount of new material when he re-releases a product on DVD.The production quality is excellent as always, and I feel this is one of the few videos available by anyone that actually gives sound instruction in how to learn and practice Taijiquan pushing hands. I own a number of different pushing hands videos by various teachers. Unfortunately, they require a high level of skill in order to benefit from the material as the tapes either are not in English or use limited English to teach the concepts. Many of the tapes available from other teachers do not cover the material as thoroughly as does Dr. Yang.Taijiquan pushing hands is a critical skill to develop for anyone that is serious in their study of Taijiquan. It is, I hate to say impossible, but let's face reality, there is no way a person can reach their potential in the application of Taijiquan techniques unless time is spent doing pushing hands with a variety of practitioners. OK, so you and a couple of buddies toss each other around in kind of free for all haphazard method (or lack of). That is not pushing hands, and anyone not learning proper methods in pushing hands can only reach a low level of skill.Learn the techniques and pushing hands routines on this video, practice often with everyone that is willing, and your skill will greatly increase. As skill increases, it becomes possible to truly \"win\" in pushing hands while being very conservative with your energy. Watching someone \"win\" at pushing hands while overpowering the other person is not as impressive as seeing someone with high skill seemingly control the other person while staying centered, calm and using very efficient techniques. This kind of skill comes from long hours of practice with live persons and using correct techniques, like the ones taught on this video.The video covers the following material, with both courses available on the DVD:Course 1Structure of Pushing HandsBasic Taiji Symbol Sticking HandsSolo Single Pushing HandsPartner Single Pushing HandsPartner Double Pushing HandsCourse 2Basic Yin/Yang Taiji Ball QigongThree Basic JinsMoving Taiji Symbol Sticking HandsInternational Stationary Double Pushing Hand RoutineInternational Moving Double Pushing Hands RoutineDr. Yang personally demonstrates the majority of the material. He then uses students of varying levels of skill to demonstrate the techniques further. It is always beneficial to the student when they are able to view various levels of skill when learning new movements. If one only sees correctly done moves, how will a student be able to differentiate between correct moves and moves that violate the principles of Taijiquan. Just as one must know and understand the yin and the yang when practicing Taijiquan, one must also know and understand what is correct practice and what is not.Very few teachers have passed onto the general public information concerning how to use the yin yang diagram in their forms and in their applications (push hands). Jou, Tsung Hwa touched briefly on the subject in his book \"The Tao of Taijiquan\". In his book he talks about using the yin yang diagram to practice the various types of kicks found in the form. Additionally, he shares some thoughts about the hand positions, phases of the moon and using the yin yang diagram.Why am I not surprised that Dr. Yang is the first martial artist to release this information on video (to the best of my knowledge). Dr. Yang and his production staff have certainly set the standard for the way martial arts videos should be produced.",

The transition from novice exercises to those of a proficient practitioner, is very quick and you can be left in the dust slightly by Dr. Yang as he incorporates the entire body and breathing patterns into what is seemingly a simple hand motion.From a novice perspective, this DVD will take a year or even two to fully complete and a lifetime to master.Having a partner at home who is also willing to learn is a huge help as a lot of the exercises, and the very nature of pushing hands, is for two people. In saying that there are a lot of solo exercises that move well beyond novice level very quickly, not too fast as to overwhelm you, more fast enough to make you realise how much mental effort is required to co-ordinate the entire body as one in a rhythmic motion. You then must move past that, so you don't have to think about it so much, more that it becomes natural, so you can concentrate on your partner.Dr. Yang is a great teacher, and with so many DVD's on the many different aspects of Taijiquan, even small town, or country people who may not have a local instructor or school they can go to, can learn from a true master.",

    "review/summary": "Excellent Taiji Video for All Stylists",
    "review/text": "Although one of my good friends and training partners studies the Chinese martial arts and owns much of Dr. Yang's library, Taiji Pushing Hands 1 & 2 was my first direct exposure to this renowned instructor, and let me just say that I was utterly impressed. The supple and smooth, yet powerful and explosive, movements of his body are a sight to behold. Even more impressive is the fact that he can do them all while standing on the sides of bricks. Any martial artist, no matter what his or her style, would be happy to have this type of body control in his/her toolbox.And really, that is what makes this video so great - the content is really quite style neutral. Sure, its primary audience is taiji practitioners. However, anyone who watches this video with an open mind is going to find many skills, drills, and methods that will mold seamlessly into his/her style of choice. In fact, while watching the video, I was continually finding myself thinking things such as, \"Oh, that looks like blank technique from so-and-so kata.\" In addition, Dr. Yang explains all of the movements in such a way that even someone with no prior exposure to pushing hands can follow along reasonably well. Really, the only place where the exposition is inadequate is during the Taiji Ball Qigong exercises at the beginning of Course 2. Although the viewer is referred to a separate video that specifically discusses these movements, some small amount of discussion would have been useful to fit them into the larger picture. However, this is only a minor issue and does nothing to detract from the way in which the rest of the material is presented.Furthermore, not only are the practices in this video well explained, they are also quite practical. Anyone who thinks that taiji is simply some form of relaxing \"New Age\"-y exercise that has no relevance to self-defense needs only to watch this video to see the fallacy of his or her argument. Not only does Dr. Yang give the viewer numerous pushing hands drills to practice either solo or with a partner, he also frequently demonstrates how the flowing movements from the drills can blend directly into a variety of joint locks and takedowns. Plus, he even shows a couple of different ways that a heavy bag/sand bag can be used to practice the pushing hands techniques. Watching the video, it is clear why pushing/sticking hands-type drills were once a central part to many different martial arts. Moreover, it is a great motivator for reintroducing them into styles where their practice has been neglected.Finally, unlike many martial arts videos, the production values on this DVD are quite solid. The picture is clear, and aside from a few sound pops here and there, the audio is good. Moreover, the menus are easy to navigate and allow the viewer to go directly to the specific drills he or she wants to practice. Overall, I give this video top marks and look forward to watching other Dr. Yang productions.",

Myra is re-introduced (she recently fired Lester as lead-actor from her previous Broadway play) to Lester Blaine (played by the very handsome Jack Palance) on a train trip back to her home, from NY.Myra and Jack soon fall in love and quickly marry. Their marriage seems perfect. Joan's character is an older, successful, beautiful, and highly intelligent women. And Lester wasn't at all intimidated Myra's successes....In fact Lester welcomes her success and her money. He soon meets up with his former flame, Irene Neves (played by Gloria Grahame). Irene and Lester plot to murder Myra so they can run away with all of her money.Myra inadvertently learns of their deceitful plot and thus the title \"Sudden Fear\" is born! It's now a race against time to see if Myra can sidestep the murder plot.Joan is absolutely devastatingly beautiful in this picture, and she had such a graceful and elegant presence that always took center stage in this picture. This movie is a must-see for any Joan Crawford fan. I have seen all of her movies and this is right up there with the very best films she made during the 30's & 40's.",

You see, she done him wrong at an earlier date. Now it's retribution time. But who is outdoing whom? Twists abound. Joan Crawford (Oscar nominated) and Jack Palance (his first Oscar nomination) are excellent. The cast also includes Gloria Grahame, Bruce Bennett, Virginia Huston and Touch (Mike) Connors. The effective Black and White cinematography is by Charles Lang (also Oscar nominated). This film also boasts one of Elmer Bernstein's earliest scores. Bernstein has been a leading writer of film scores since the mid-1950s, when his work on THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM (1955) and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956) elevated him into the front rank of Hollywood composers. His score for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960) made him immortal and launched him into a string of successful Western scores through that decade. However, he highly has been noted for his strong use of solo instruments and his facility with the jazz idiom. 1999's WILD, WILD WEST returned him to his beloved Western.",

Hopefully the upcoming Crawford boxed set from Warner Bros will include a better version of this film. Keep your fingers crossed.That said, I love this movie, even with it's ridiculous ending.

    "review/summary": "Joan Crawford Oscar Nominated In Late Career Classic Thriller Role",
    "review/text": "After ending her 1940's Warner Bros. contract due to dissatisfaction with the caliber of the roles she was being offered Joan Crawford moved into the next phase of her illustrious career as an independant performer choosing her own scripts. The first film she chose to undertake was \"Sudden Fear\" based on a famous novel by Edna Sherry that she very sensibly optioned and saw as a perfect showcase for her by now mature talents as an actress. \"Sudden Fear\", offered Crawford a terrific and most welcome change of pace from her last largely lacklustre efforts at Warners such as \"Goodbye My Fancy\", and \"This Woman is Dangerous\", and could be seen as the next installment in the continual redevelopment and redirection that Joan seemed to undertake careerwise at roughly 10 year intervals and the end result was truly remarable here. Providing Joan with her third well deserved Academy Award Nomination \"Sudden Fear\", gave her the perfect transitional role into the more assertive characters she undertook through the 1950's and never has she been a more dynamic presence on screen than here where within the course of the action she evolves from potential victim to the one pulling the strings in a complex tale of cat and mouse intrigue and murder. Crawford for once in her mature career has a vehicle worthy of her talents and is tremendously aided by a wonderful script that contains nail biting suspense, melodrama, murder, and interesting characterisations by the supporting cast.After Joan Crawford's career slump in the late 1940's \"Sudden Fear\" proved to be a big success at the Box Office and certainly helped pave the way for the many \"take charge\", characters that became her trademark from then on. Joan Crawford plays Myra Hudson a wealthy and highly successful playwright who as the story begins we find in a dilemma over what she feels is a wrong choice of actor. Feeling that actor Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) is definately not the type of leading man she had in mind she gets him fired from the production. Thinking that that is the end of the situation the play eventually opens to great acclaim however when Myra travels alone on the train to the West Coast for the plays opening there she encounters Lester again on the train and very soon a quite unexpected romance springs up between the former adversaries. After a whirlwind courtship Myra marries Lester and the pair settle down to domestic life in her San Francisco mansion. However Myra's happiness is short lived when by accident she overhears a conversation that was recorded on her copying machine between Lester Blaine and his old girlfriend Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame). Having heard that Myra intends to donate most of her fortune to charities Lester's real intent comes out and is unfortunately captured unbeknownst to him and Irene on Myra's tape. The pair intend to murder Myra before she gives away her fortune with Lester then inheriting her entire fortune after which he will marry the wily Irene. Overcoming her initial panic and heartwrending sense of betrayal by Lester, Myra composes herself and utilizing her playwright's experience and imagination begins to concoct and then put into action an involved and utterly fascinating sequence of events to outwit the would be murderers at their own deadly game. Secretly fearing her devious husband but trying not to show her true feelings Myra continues to play the loving wife while putting her plan into action. Over the course of one evening Myra manages to evade being alone with Lester by pretending to be sick and leaves the house to set in motion her plan to frame Lester and get rid of Irene into the bargain. All does not go exactly as Myra plans however and she has to endure a terrifying pursuit by Lester through the deserted late night streets of San Francisco before a case of mistaken identity and a matching fur coat and scarf makes Lester believe he is just about to run down Myra in his car when in fact he is mistaken. The conclusion sees tragedy of a different kind result but which sees a shaken Myra able to walk away from the situation to a new life without her menacing husband.There are those that dismiss \"Sudden fear\", as a \"camp\", thriller however I feel it has its genuine moments of nail biting suspense that gives it its own corner in the noir thriller genre. Joan Crawford of course dominates the proceedings and her development of her character from trusting middle aged wife into first class schemer equal to her devious husband is a great achievement. Through much of the climax of the story once Myra puts her plan into execution Crawford uses her hugely expressive eyes to great effect which is best illustrated in the scene when she breaks into Gloria Grahame's apartment and is almost caught by her husband and has to hide in the closet. Crawford here is superb in conveying much of her feeling and emotions with very minimal dialogue. It's hard to imagine now but Crawford campaigned heavily for long time costar Clark Gable to play the role of Lester however the younger Jack Palance is perfect for this role ( he was also Oscar nominated here) as the younger man being supported by his wealthy older wife and his very distinctive looks make him an ideal villian in the story. He actually works very well with Joan Crawford despite their reported off screen lack of chemistry. Perrenial bad girl Gloria Grahame is superb in her role of Lester's trouble making old girlfriend out for a larger slice of the pie and prepared to murder for it. Grahame's distinctive speaking voice and hard exterior also add much to the role and she is perfectly deceitful in her scenes where she supposedly is being a new friend to the older Myra while secretly plotting her death. Grahame was so effective in the role that she too was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. Director David Miller gets well rounded performances from what is essentially a three character study in \"Sudden Fear\" with the emphasis being on things not really being what they appear to be with any of these three main characters. Miller's direction of Joan Crawford in particular is especially effective and he manages throughout the story to keep her character just on the edge of potential tragedy then in the next instance brings the character full circle so that she is again in control of the stories proceedings. Another of the strong selling points of \"Sudden Fear\" is its beautiful look with the strong elements of black and white light and shade courtesy of gifted cinematographer Oscar nominated Charles Lang, greatly enhancing the films look and feel and it works superbly in the moments of high tension such as Lester's pursuit of Myra through darkened streets lit only by dim far off lamp lights. Along with the superb lighting the great use of many San Francisco locations for the exterior shots also adds greatly to the films overall look.\"Sudden Fear\", is one of my favourite later Joan Crawford vehicles and despite losing the Oscar that year I feel she was most deserving of a second nod after her earlier win in \"Mildred Pierce\". I can't say that Jack Palance is really a favourite actor of mine but I feel he made ideal casting here and \"Sudden Fear\", really helped in setting him along in the successful career he had later on. Joan Crawford I always find a terrific performer and too often she seems to be relegated into the \"camp\", school of acting by critics and public alike. Here she does have a character worthy of her considerable and often underrated talents and she makes the most of it in \"Sudden Fear\". For all lovers of suspense and nail biting tension \"Sudden fear\", makes a great addition to any film collection and is an important film to look at when seeking to understand the enduring popularity of movie legend Joan Crawford.",

    "review/text": "Probably the best of Crawford's 50's vehicles, \"Fear\" is a very good noir thriller on it's own terms. Director David Miller reportedly fought Crawford to get a realistic performance out of her instead of her just waltzing through the film on star power which was how she usually operated. It's still a Crawford performance but it works. A playwrite/heiress marries an actor she recently fired from one of her plays (Jack Palance). He has a trampy girlfriend on the side (Gloria Grahame) who plots with him to dispose of Myra, the playwrite, and when she finds out--after much terror-emoting---she plots to trip them up. Tension is nicely built up and the performances by all are first-rate. The noir b&w photography is great and on-location shooting in San Francisco gives it a gritty feel. DVD is fine thanks to Kino/Image providing a good, once obscure movie that had nominations for Oscars for Crawford(!) and Palance. At the time, early 50's on, it was said that Crawford was better when she was \"menaced in mink\". This film is a fine example of that remark. If you're a fan of Crawford, Palance or Grahame don't pass this one up.",

    "review/summary": "Great to re-experience the 'fear'...",
    "review/text": "Most of the previous reviewers have done an excellent job of outlining the plot details of this fine older film. I have just a few comments to add.Since DVDs have arrived and video has become a stepchild, we have an excellent opportunity to view old favorites with little impact on the purse. Sometimes a visit to old haunts proves our memory a little faulty or shows the film itself just hasn't aged well.I loved this movie that first time around and it proved to be just as wonderful in a recent memory lane visit.Joan Crawford, never one of my favorite actresses, deserved the Oscar for this performance, not just a nomination. It was definitely one of her best. She was able to convey the 'fear' without making one groan at any overacting. She portrayed a bright woman with a fear, a plan, a conscious, and a heart with brilliance and with just the right amount of conviction.Jack Palance, conversely always a favorite of mine, was his menacing best in this performance without having to overact for a second. The perfect role, played to perfection.It is always enjoyable to see the work of stars you have forgotten were in favorite old films. Touch (Mike) Conners (TV's Mannix) played Sonny in this film, which didn't rumble back into memory when I watched him each week on TV, but I recognized his name in the opening credits immediately this time. It was very interesting to watch him in retrospect in an early effort (perhaps his first?).Hollywood in their infinite wisdom seems to have decided that today's audiences are too jaded, too sophisticated, too juvenile, or too something to enjoy a simple thriller in the ilk of 'Sudden Fear', 'Midnight Lace', or other great 'woman-in-distress/woman-with-a-plan films, unless they modern-it-up as in 'Panic Room'. Perhaps they know a thing or two, since they are wealthy and I work a 9-to-5 job and post reviews on a website.However, speaking for myself, and hopefully for other viewers who still enjoy; a simple plot with character-study, suspense, b/w beauty, and pleasure while viewing, 'Sudden Fear' tells a great story in a suspenseful manner. I still makes for great viewing. Grab yourself a bargain and enjoy!",

    "review/text": "\"Sudden Fear\" is a suspense classic from 1952: an enjoyable, tightly written, well-paced thriller starring a trio of past, present, and future Oscar winners: the incomparable Joan Crawford (Best Actress, 1945, \"Mildred Pierce\"); a young Jack Palance (Best Supporting Actor, 1991, \"City Slickers\" - remember the push ups?) and Gloria Grahame, who won Best Supporting Actress for another 1952 film, \"The Bad and the Beautiful.\"Crawford portrays a playwright who, in the movie's first scene, gets Palance fired from her play for not looking like a traditional leading man. Palance storms off in anger, but later meets up with Crawford on a train and - irony of ironies - manages to seduce her. They engage in a whirlwind romance, get married, and move into her San Francisco home. All seems to be going smashingly, until... well, I can't say more without giving too much away!Crawford is a natural fit for the role. She gets to suffer the way she did in \"Mildred Pierce\" (albeit a tad more histrionically), and earned her third and final Oscar nomination in the process. Palance demonstrates surprising dramatic range, and Grahame shows up in the tough-as-nails femme fatale role she would go on to perfect in the following year's \"The Big Heat.\"The film is more noir in tone and style than in milieu. Director David Miller makes effective use of light and shadow, and the San Francisco locations add local flavor to the film. The late, great composer Elmer Bernstein contributes an evocative score.Many have rightly complained about the DVD transfer; it certainly is fuzzy in spots, though for the most part watchable. A lower price tag would be more appropriate for this edition.\"Sudden Fear\" isn't the most original thriller of its era, but it's skillfully done. While somewhat manipulative and predictable, \"Sudden Fear\" generates enough authentic suspense to satisfy the classic movie buff.",

    "review/text": "Sudden Fear is a fascinating cross between a woman's film and film noir. Perhaps because of its older female protagonist, it has been unfairly neglected. Joan Crawford, acting less histrionically than usual, plays Myra Hudson an heiress and successful playwright. The fact that she's rich and talented makes her an obvious target. She falls for and marries sleazy actor Lester Blaine, terrifically played by Jack Palance. Blaine and his mistress, the younger and more attractive Irene (Gloria Grahame) plot to kill her for her fortune. Crawford looks middle-aged and frumpy in this film; she seems to be wearing less make-up and is photographed from less flattering angles. It almost transforms her into a different actress. Its as if we're seeing her true face. For financial reasons, Lester and Irene only have a small window of time to murder her in order to get the money. The latter part of the film is punctuated by ticking clocks. Myra has minutes to pull herself together and save her own life. The ticking clocks also have to do with Myra's aging, dwindling attractiveness and mortality. There are many close-ups of her aging hands and feet that have the effect of magnifying her physical vulnerability. In the film's dramatic denouement, Myra dresses like Irene and the two women's identities merge as they become the object of Blaine's murderous rage. Crawford's training as a silent film actress make the last part of the film extraordinary. A truly great film!",

One of the first Joan films I have ever seen(way back in 99/2000),it still remains one of her best!If I had to choose(from the titles I have seen/own),A Woman's Face,Sudden fear,Mildred,Dancing Lady,The Women.First off, some side notes...By 1952,Joan had terminated her contract with Warners after some less than mediocre assignments. For the first time in her long career, she became a freelance artist. She found the script at RKO,and ultimatly doubled up as actress and producer. Joan also took less money up front and more percentage from the potential(big)box office. When the film became a huge hit,it help revive her fortunes as well as her 3rd oscar nod.Incidently, Joan INSISTED on Marlon Brando for the role of husband from hell \"lester Blaine\" Apparenly she hounded him a few times, and after she sent him the script, she recieved a note stating he \"isn't interested in doing any mother-son pictures at this time\" HARSH! I'm sure Joan reached for the 80 proof when she got that one!In this film,Joan plays\"Myra(Can't remember the last name)\" a older playright/hieress.Only in Joan's world can someone be both a playright AND an heiress! One a cross country train trip Myra encounters an actor she recently fired from one of her play's\"lester Blaine(the wonderful Jack Palance in his movie debut)\". Of course they get to talking and romance blossoms(sigh).Upon the new couple's return to San fransico, all is right with the world and Joan is feeling \"very gay\" due to her impending engagement...THE DICTAPHONES SECRET;Myra keeps a BIG ASS dictaphone in her study for the purpose of recording anything she needs to apparently. One morning after a party, Myra turns it on and to her SUDDEN FEAR, she encounters a plot by her new HUBBY to kill her during the thin window before her new will bequests the majority of her vast estate to charity,,,Instead of a NORMAL person whom take the recording to the police, Joan attempts to hie it and BREAKS IT!Joan realizes she must take it upon herself to save her own life! Ergo,Joan world becomes a crazy mix of paranoia,hallucinations, and nightmares. Some of joans acting in the nightmare sequences is pretty hokey, but excluding this, her acting can't be topped!Again, as in 'A Womans Face\" in the crucial third act, Joan is required to emote bec she is hiding in a closet from lester,,,This is one of the best sequences of the film and is beautifully shot,,,There is alot of tension in this film after Myra's discovery(obviously)...and the viewer never forgets Joan MASTERED the requisite talent harking back to her silent days.... Another highlight is when Joan(earlier in the film-pretending she knows nothing) sickenly sweetly proclaims to lester,\"I don't know what i did to deserve you...\"After she turns her back to him,,,,you can REALLY see what is going on in her head,,,,,but the brilliance is how quickly, severly, and convincingly her mood changes,,,One of course can only expect this from truly great talent....Also worth mentioning is the excellent Gloria Graham(as Irene the other woman unbeknowst to Joan) whom was making a name for herself in gritty,hardboiled tough guy films... her comments to joan after joan'sprains\" her ankle are quite snarky and fun! This is one of Joan's best!",

    "review/text": "Joan Crawford was an actress a generation before mine, and I knew little about her except for some 1960s films like \"I Saw What You Did\", or the abysmal \"Trog\". When the \"Mommie Dearest\" Faye Dunaway film portrayal later appeared, it formed an impression of Crawford as an eccentric who abused her adopted children. I held that image for decades and had no interest in her films.Then around 2000, I saw \"Sudden Fear\" on TCM. I was floored by her talent as an actress. The latter part of this film, after she discovers the plot against her, and especially in the streets after her bad husband tries to run her down, is stunning. The scene of her walking with tears in her eyes tore me apart. I could not get the scene out of my mind. Then I discovered another great film, \"Johnny Guitar\", then \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,\" and even appreciated lower budget films such as \"Strait-Jacket\". The list goes on and on. Over the past decade, I have concluded that Joan Crawford is my all-time favorite actress. She was a STAR, a movie star of the highest caliber and no modern actor or actress has either the ability or presence that she has on film.I am satisfied with the video and audio portion of the 60 year old film on the DVD. Kino typically presents the best images available and works to improve what they have too. I do think the price for the DVD is way too high, though.",

    "review/text": "Once I finally broke down and bought a DVD player, I thought the only possible way to break it in was with an unfamiliar film by my beloved Joan Crawford, 1952's Sudden Fear. The film is a real thriller, sort of a higher-class film noir forerunner of some of the more exciting horror films she made in the 1960s (Strait-Jacket and Berserk come to mind; I won't watch Baby Jane because I can't stand to see Joan be mistreated).Joan is magnificent as a wealthy heiress/playwright who becomes the target of a murder plot by her actor husband (Jack Palance) and his girlfriend (Gloria Grahame, whose scene-stealing performance is almost worth the price of the film). Joan becomes privy to the murder plan thanks to the advanced electronic technology in her San Francisco mansion. Always the playwright, she uses her plot-devising skills to foil the murder attempt, but backs out at the last second from carrying out her plan. We do however at least get the satisfaction of seeing what she had intended through a kind of dream sequence which left me cheering.Up to the last few minutes of the film, I felt it definitely deserved five stars. However, the ending is a bit of a letdown; it is far too dependent on mere chance to be satisfactory. I couldn't help thinking that a better ending that arose more naturally from the plot could have been devised. For example, if Joan had carried it out, the dream sequence would have been a great improvement over the ending we have, and confirmed once more her regular screen persona of being in charge of every situation.Nevertheless, Sudden Fear is an engrossing and exciting film. It was a great way to both break in my new DVD player and to spend an evening, not to mention being a valuable addition to my appreciation of Joan Crawford the actress.",

    "review/text": "Not so many films noirs of the 40's and 50's are to be found in the DVD standard until now so the arrival of David Miller's SUDDEN FEAR is a pleasure we would be foolish to neglect. With an imperial Joan Crawford, a Jack Palance sweating hypocrisy and, last but not least, with Gloria Grahame ! YES ! THE Gloria Grahame with her voice, childish, slightly pathetic and undoubtedly sexy, SUDDEN FEAR is a superior movie of this peculiar genre.Joan Crawford is Myra Hudson, a woman of character, a playwriter who dares to refuse to Jack &quot;Lester&quot; Palance the first role of her new play. Who will control whom ? That's the theme treated by director David Miller in SUDDEN FEAR. In the movie's beginning, we are lead to think that Jack Palance is going to eat alive a Joan Crawford blinded by love. But Myra will quickly recover from this common illness and take her destiny in charge again.The last third of SUDDEN FEAR is one of the most impressive moments I've lived, cinematographically speaking, since weeks. Myra Hudson will direct &quot;live&quot; the characters she has described in her books for years, she will control, in a certain manner, the sound (with the micros hidden in her office) and the image (with the power of the mind) of the play she is going to be part of. But the ultimate minutes of SUDDEN FEAR will prove that Myra Hudson cannot act so, in the same way she has fired once Lester, she is replaced in the final act by Gloria Grahame for a tragic final.Myra Hudson cannot act nor direct. Luckily enough for us, David Miller has showed us that he can.A scene access as sole extra feature ( it's too much, you shouldn't have, IMAGE ! )A DVD for your library.",

    "review/text": "Joan Crawford achieved one of her greatest performances in the 1952 suspense classic \"Sudden Fear.\" In the manner of so many great Hollywood classics, this film overcame an initial major hurdle when, after the film's director, David Miller, following dinner and discussion with the great actress, was reportedly told to leave in the most emotional terms by Crawford.The basis for Crawford's strong creative disagreement with Miller, and what would be a pivotal element of the project, was Miller's belief that film newcomer Jack Palance would be ideal for her leading man. As proof of his point, Miller had brought along a film for Crawford to watch after dinner, which was Palance's debut, \"Panic in the Streets.\" After viewing the film Crawford mistakenly believed that Miller had either Richard Widmark or Paul Douglas, longstanding film professionals, in mind to play opposite her, and was insulted when Miller suggested newcomer Palance. Crawford reportedly also was turned off by Palance's appearance.Miller finally got Crawford to see things his way and the rest is cinema history as both the great leading lady and Palance received deserving Oscar nominations for their brilliant performances. Miller was shrewd enough to realize that an offbeat, terrifying looking leading man was just the antidote for Crawford, who therefore could appear vulnerable as was required by the exigencies of the story. The fascinating element about Crawford in this film is that she appears appropriately terrified, forging an entirely different persona from the assertive executive female type she normally played who was in full command of her agenda.The early phase of the film has a \"life imitates art\" aspect when Crawford, as Myra Hudson, a successful playwright, rejects actor Lester Blaine, played by Palance, for the lead in her Broadway play because he does not look appropriately romantic enough to play as leading man. He angrily tells her before leaving the theater that he looks exactly like that legendary lover of old, Cassanova.After Crawford's play opens to smashing reviews in New York she returns to her home in San Francisco, meeting Palance again as they are traveling on the same train. The second meeting between them becomes so supercharged with emotion that Palance abandons plans to stop in Chicago, where a new job offer beckons, traveling instead to San Francisco with Crawford.Myra Hudson comes from old San Francisco wealth. This along with her rich play royalties make her an enticing catch for the opportunistic Palance, who in time proves he more than looks like Cassanova. Before long the successful socialite and playwright becomes Mrs. Lester Blaine.At that point Palance's old romantic flame from New York, Gloria Grahame, enters the scene. They then plot to kill Crawford for her money. Crawford learns about their plot when it turns up on her dictating machine, unknown to the plotters.The story then enters a uniquely fascinating phase as Crawford seeks to use her playwright's imagination to concoct a scenario wherein the Palance-Grahame team will fail in their attempt and she will survive. Many of the scenes contain little or no dialogue, with Crawford's expressive eyes revealed with haunting conviction as they register alternately sadness over being betrayed by someone to whom she gave her heart and fear over being killed by the ruthless team of Palance and Grahame, who are tough-willed and make it plain they will stop at nothing to achieve their objective of wealth at Crawford's expense.In addition to pulsating drama, viewers are also treated to the beautiful scenery of San Francisco, which is captured magnificently by the camera's all-seeing eye.",

    "review/text": "\"Sudden Fear\" falls in the category of female melodrama film noir, a sub-genre which Joan Crawford dominated. Based on Edna Sherry's story of the same name, this is an entertaining film, but not up to the standard of Crawford's other film noirs: \"Possessed\", \"Mildred Pierce\", and \"The Damned Don't Cry\". Crawford plays playwright and heiress Myra Hudson, who refuses to cast actor Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) in her new play, because he doesn't look romantic enough. Traveling from New York to her home in San Francisco by train, she meets Lester Blaine again. This time, she finds him very attractive, indeed, and falls in love. When Lester employs emotional blackmail to get Myra to marry him, she happily agrees, and is thrilled to be his wife. But unbeknownst to Myra, Lester's old girlfriend Irene Neves (Gloria Grahame) has arrived in town expecting money. When Myra inadvertently uncovers plans by Lester and Irene to murder her, she is devastated and terrified. Then she starts plotting.\"Sudden Fear\" is a film that takes its time. It's not plodding, but there are a lot of scenes that aren't strictly necessary but give Joan Crawford more screen time. The \"sudden fear'\" of the title must refer to Myra's reaction when she discovers her life is in danger from the very man whom she would be willing to sacrifice it for. She is frantic, paralyzed with fear, almost to the point of mania. But this isn't one of Joan Crawford's more convincing emotional states -not in this film, anyway. Of course, Myra doesn't do the sensible thing and go to the police. Crawford's performance regains credibility with Myra's duplicity as she plots revenge. Jack Palance does a nice job of a two- or three-faced Lester Blaine. He is at first a passionate and thoughtful actor, then a docile and dutiful husband. It's a little shocking when he is suddenly quite brutal. Jack Palance gives the stand-out performance and holds his own well against Crawford's undeniable screen presence. All in all, \"Sudden Fear\" is an entertaining suspense film that stays unpredictable until the end.The DVD (refers to the Kino Video 2001 disc only) This print of the film has some occasional specks and spots, and the grays are grainy, but no serious flaws. The print is acceptable but unrestored. No bonus features or subtitles.",

    "review/text": "Before I begin my review of 'Sudden Fear' in earnest, I have to point out that this is a really poor transfer to DVD of a 1950's noir classic. Movies like 'Mildred Pierce' and 'The Women' are much older films, but of a far better picture and sound quality.That said, it's a good thing that this is finally available on DVD, while other Crawford classics like 'Flamingo Road' are still languishing in the Vault someplace.Now, on with the review. Joan plays Myra Hudson, the successful and wealthy San Francisco playwright, who, after having fired him from her latest hit production, falls in love with and marries an actor named Lester Blaine (Jack Palance). Against all sense and reason, Myra attempts to change her will to leave him with everything, but an overheard conversation between the conniving, unfaithful Lester and his scheming girlfriend Irene (Gloria Grahame) forces her to think very differently. A shocking climax ensues.Made in 1952, this is Joan's first independent picture, (for RKO Pictures) and revived a flagging career. What we see here is what I like to refer to as Middle-Era Joan, being neither the ultra-glamorous 1940's Joan of 'Mildred Pierce' and 'The Women', nor the screechy, scary Joan of 'Baby Jane' and 'Strait-Jacket'. She turns in a classic Crawford performance as the hapless Myra, full of facial tremblings and overpronunciation. She's excellent as the Victim, but this is perhaps her best performance in a film outside of 'Mildred Pierce' and 'Flamingo Road'. She is touching in the love scenes, and tense and compelling in the suspense scenes. What's also remarkable is the fact that she plays the part of the older-but-none-the-wiser Myra with such honesty, instead of trying to make this on-the-shelf spinster any younger than the script allows.Jack Palance is excellent, too, as the duplicitous Lester. He's loving and warm with his wife, but menacing and hateful in the private moments with Irene. His face is hypnotic, sometimes it's difficult to watch anything else on the screen, but he does an brilliant job with a character who swings between two extreme poles of emotion.Gloria Grahame is simply astonishing in her role as Irene Neves. She is cold, manipulating and possesses a strange kind of open-mouthed blatant sexuality that makes her wholly believable as the Mistress. She pouts, schemes and demands her way into the picture, and her performance in what is essentially a supporting role easily stands up to heavyweights like Crawford and Palance.Direction by David Miller is somewhat experimental for the period, but excellent. The darkness and angles used in lighting the piece gives a real sense of the noir, and the long one-shot scenes add a huge sense of tension and fear.The ending of the movie is slightly contrived, and a little quick, but we are still left with a tense psychological thriller that stands up today as a fine example of film-making. Highly recommended.",

    "review/text": "What a hoot of a film! It is a classic Joan Crawford \"Queen Bee, poor me the victim\" story. Crawford plays an ultra-wealthy San Franciscan socialite who writes incredably successful plays in New York City - non-stop! Plus she's just so nice and polite, that when she doesn't think the new leading man is sexy enough, she can't bear to fire him - so she gets someone else to. BIG mistake! Poor Joan 'falls in love' with conniving rejected actor. Actor then schemes with Gloria Grahame (of \"Oklahoma's\" girl who can't say \"no\" fame) to well...it doesn't matter. Joan's character is so annoying blind to the scheme that even when she has blatant evidence of the 'plot against her' she has this extended, drawn-out, wild-eyed scene of disbelief that is; well, hard to friggin' believe! What fantastic overacting! The ending is predictable and a little far fetched. Palance is great as the 'bad' actor and Grahame was so young, but so good! She deserved an Oscar for this performance. The last minute is surreal. Joan's character turns from deathly horrified to a smiling \"life is going to be okay\" facade in less than 60 seconds! Talk about wrapping up a film as quickly as possible!Trivia: Poor Joan was showing her age in this film (bad hair; grey showing) and it's tough to believe that Palance's character (hunky, hunky) would love her for more than money. Joan - always the victim!",

    "review/text": "I think if Joan Crawford had not been cast in this film it would not be given much importance because it is not that good a film but she manages to give one of her most sympathetic performances, one for which she was nominated for an Academy Award, although she should have recieved this honor for some of her other work like JOHNNY GUITAR or WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?. Almost singlehandly she manages to provide the movie with many moments of unbearable suspense though the directon is not too shabby. The director David Miller uses light and shadows to provide a good, tension filled atmosphere and Gloria Grahame,in a performance for which she was nomintated as best supporting actress, also supplies great support and she is defintley a highlight. Jack Palance is very menacing in this movie and he also manages to do a good job. The script is not that original though and ultimatly the script is the problem with the movie. And before i forget the story is about a playwright named Myra Hudson(Joan Crawford) who marries the actor she fired from her play(Jack Palance). She then discovers a plot that has been concocted between her husband and his lover( Gloria Grahame) to kill her for her money. Then she comes up with a plot to kill them instead. But will she go through with it? You will have to find out.",

    "review/text": "Not many fans of Joan Crawford are familiar with this film, but they should be. Attractive San Francisco location shooting and a superb supporting cast featuring Jack Palance, Mike (`Touch\") Conners, and Gloria Grahame, raise the bar of this exciting, nail biter noir classic, despite a rather simple and familiar plot. What's fascinating about the film is how director David Miller takes a familiar plot and presents the drama within it in a most entertaining and absorbing fashion. Crawford plays a successful San Francisco heiress/playwright, Myra Hudson, who falls for Lester Blaine (Palance), an actor who unsuccessfully auditioned for one of her plays. They eventually meet on a train back to San Francisco and after a whirlwind courtship, the two eventually get married, but after a few months into the marriage, Myra later catches on that Lester and his old flame, Irene (Grahame), intend to kill her so he can inherit her fortune.Note Director David Miller's brilliant cinematography--how he effectively telegraphs the use of ordinary objects--an initialed handkerchief, a key, a Dictaphone machine (even a small clockwork mechanical dog!), and his successful use of dissolves, light and shadow, and mise-en-scene to convey the terror and fear that not only registers on Crawford's expressive face within the frame, but is carried thru an entire scene. In this film, Crawford perhaps most successfully exhibits the strong, yet vulnerable characters she made a long career out of playing. Although the intended victim of a nefarious plot to take her life and her fortune, we see how Crawford's Myra Hudson consciously and methodically intends to turn the tables on her unfaithful paramour and his lover just as if she writing a plot synopsis outline for one of her plays.This was Palance's first \"starring\" role after his smallish role in the classic \"Panic in the Streets\" with Richard Widmark. He admirably conveys both the aura of vulnerability and deceit necessary to charm Crawford's character into believing he is her doting, loving husband. While this is not in the same league as, say, \"Mildred Pierce,\" it should be considered as one of Crawford's better films and, as it stands, it is a superlative achievement in film noir.",

But I am not saying she can't be good- despite the nutty scene where she finds out that Palance plans to off her (where she does everything but juggle while spinning her head around a la Linda Blair in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;), she's good in this one.

The movie is edge-of-your-seat suspenseful with great cinematography. Darkness and shadows are used to full effect to create a dark tone to the movie. The movie reminds me of some of Hitchcock's black and white suspense thrillers. Jack Palance also turns in a great performance as Crawford's husband who has a sinister plot brewing. Gloria Grahame also does well in her role as \"the other woman\". Crawford was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in a leading role and Jack Palance was nominated for his supporting role. If you want to see Palance in one of his best villainous roles, then see this movie.A lot of people complain about the DVD print being sub par. It's a 60-year old movie, so it's not going to have an absolutely crystal clear picture and sound. Can it be cleaned up? Maybe, but it's not an absolute certainty. Some films can be restored and some can't. We'll leave it up to the experts.",

It shows how her character is instinctively a good and honest person and could never kill anyone in real life. I find it highly effective.I really don't think she is smirking at the end. I think she looks almost resigned, numb, somewhat exhausted by the whole surreal thing. It's my favorite ending of any Joan movie (next to \"Humoresque\"). There she is a survivor walking into the SUNRISE. She is alone yet liberated.Remember, when Myra found out her hubby was going to kill her and the only proof she had of this was destroyed--and thus no cop would believe her--she had roughly 48 hours (and no sleep) to react, plan, and defend herself.I would like to think her character smirked later on when she came home, took stock of her bank account, and found herself free of that evil little man. Finally, with some serenity back in her life, she would write her next and greatest play: \"Sudden Fear\".On opening night of Myra's new play--who is in the audience but Joan Crawford. Joan runs backstage after the final curtain and tells Myra she wants to buy the film rights. After a few drinks, Myra admits it was all true. \"Actually, Joan...\", Myra confesses, \"...when I was sweating my ass off in that mink, running away from that evil little man IN MY NEW HIGH HEELS, I thought to myself: 'Crawford could totally pull this off!!'\"",

All the parts are well written, and though it's Mills and Boon stuff, it's well acted, directed and shot. A classy B movie so to speak. I enjoyed Ms Crawford in this role almost as much as Johnny Guitar and more so than Mildred Pearce. She makes a meal of it and what a meal it is. Yummy stuff.",

    "review/text": "This is a tight little noir with a clever plot. Crawford almost literally chews up the furniture, flopping against doors and bannisters for most of the second half of the movie. She gives the movie a pleasant campy flavor, but I'm not a big fan of her histrionics. The real reason to watch this movie is to be thrilled by the spectacle of the white hot young Jack Palance. His onscreen &quot;romance&quot; with Gloria Graham is about as good of a depiction of unsavory lust as I have ever seen. An example: the couple meet and argue. Palance's character throws Graham onto her sofa and starts to stomp out of the room. Graham purrs after him something to the effect of 'I'm glad to know that you still love me', which stops Palance in his tracks. He turns and walks towards her, all akimbo on the sofa, and the scene fades. Yow!I give this four stars instead of five because the scene with Palance's character gone mad in the car at the end of the movie is kind of jarringly out of place, and because I can take only so much of Joan Crawford flopping on the doors.",

It an Olympian display of overacting that has never been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused, bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth. A lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's facial contortions here. I guess the reason that Crawford is such a fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself. The movie itself is serviceable but fairly ludicrous; there are glaring plot holes almost never seen in true film noir. The entire switched-identities ending is just about as bizarre as Crawford's performance.",

    "review/summary": "A Step By Step Procedure For Sculpting A Generic Head",
    "review/text": "The two DVD set \"Sculpting The Head And Face\" by Adam Reeder teaches a systematic method of sculpting a generic human head. The demonstration is not about making a portrait of a particular person. The finished head is realistic sculpture, but it does not have the level of detail that one would want in movie special effects or a wax museum. It is a roughly 3/4 life size head of a young man done in water based clay. Adam mentions that his method can be used for sculpting a particular person, but this is not taught. The point of the DVDs is to teach a method that lets a sculptor quickly remember and reproduce the landmark shapes on a typical human head and face.It is amazing that these DVDs actually do teach a step by step method. Although many other art instruction DVDs advertise \"step by step\" instruction, this is the first one I've seen that delivers it. Adam's method is unusual and it may not be to every sculptor's taste. He begins by making a profile of the head on a thin slab of clay. Then he builds up the width of the head in stages while preserving the ridge of clay in the middle of the sculpture that formed the initial profile. (You can find many short videos on the web that demonstrate sculpting the head. Another sculptor who begins with a relatively thin block of clay is Michael Weir. Both Adam Reeder and Michael Weir describe themselves as self-taught sculptors.)Adam does not use technical anatomical terms; his approach is along the lines of \"you take a lump of clay about this size, put it here and pull it this way\". This is a good course for students who aren't ready to delve into anatomy. The generic head has some rather subtle landmarks. For example, one step of the process is to put a small lump of clay near each corner of the mouth. When sculpting a portrait of a particular person, the student will know to observe this part of the face. The raised areas may not be distinct on a person with chubby jowls and they may be deformed on a person making a certain expression. A student will know that he is observing something that will contribute to the individuality of his sculpture and distinguish it from the generic face. He may be able to duplicate what he sees by putting the lumps there and partially covering them with other clay or deforming them.Adam does not do highly detailed sculpting of features such as ears, lips etc.. He does not put detail such as wrinkles, pores, raised veins etc. on the head. For the eyes, he demonstrates doing the eyelids, but not bags under the eyes or wrinkles around them. He doesn't put any fine texture on the lips. He leaves the ears in a rudimentary shape.This two DVD set is a low budget production. It definitely has a \"homemade\" quality about it. Fortunately it is homemade with the technology of 2010 instead of looking like a transfer of some VHS tape from the 1990's. The only glitch I found when playing the DVDs in Windows Media Player was that Disk 2, track 8 ( titled \"16 Finishing The Form Part 3\") hung when it finished and did not automatically go to the next track. It didn't hang the program and I was able to navigate to the next track. When I tried playing the DVDs on my four year old DVD player, I couldn't figure out how to make complete use of the track selection menu. The menu shows only the first six tracks. At the bottom there is an arrow that you must select if you want to move to the next menu. I didn't find any combination of keys on my control that would let me highlight the arrow or take me to next menu.Adam Reeder narrates in an earnest tone of voice using simple declarative sentences. If you didn't know he was an adult, you might think that that your were being taught by an enthusiastic teenager. He speaks spontaneously. His narration is organized, but not entirely smooth. There are a few places where he hesitates while finding the right words. There are a couple of times when he says \"hair line\" and by his gestures you see that he really means \"brow\" or \"line of the eyebrows\". The design of the camera work is simple and excellent. For almost all of the video, we see a view of the head sitting on a turntable. Adam is effective at rotating it to views that make his teaching clear. There are a few places where the camera makes some small unnecessary movements as if its auto-tracking feature had been turned on.You might be slightly bothered by the sound of the turntable rotating. There is one segment where you can hear the faint sounds of a child fussing. I'm glad to have this type of audio instead of the meandering background music that infests art instruction videos marketed to school boards.The teaching is step by step but there is no introductory section about \"materials and supplies that you will need\". You'll have to view the DVDs and notice the tools as they are introduced. There aren't many. His favorite tool is the blade of a roughly 8 inch long kitchen knife. He has dulled the edge with a file and removed the blade from its handle. He uses a few small wooden sculpting tools. He does smoothing with a \"kidney\", which we see is a small kidney shaped piece of rubber or plastic. Once we see him wet the clay with a spray bottle. (I don't recall ever seeing him use the wire loop type of tool that many sculptors use for cutting out clay.) He does smoothing with the type of brushes used by oil painters. They appear to be about half an inch wide.Contents and A Few Notes:DVD 1You don't see an option you play the entire DVD. To do that, pick track 2. If you pick track 1 then track 1 plays in an endless loop.1. OverviewThis is the entire sculpting process sped up and shown in a few minutes.2. IntroductionThis selection shows you the material on track 1 and continues by introducing Adam and the finished sculpture.3. Chapter I Getting startedHis explains his armature. It is a length of steel pipe screwed into a flange which is mounted on a circular wooden base. On the bottom of the base is the hardware for a \"lazy susan\", available at most hardware stores. He doesn't put any additional structure on the top of the pipe. (Some other sculptors put a ball of wires there.) He has formed a column of clay over the pipe and he let the clay harden for awhile so it will support the rest of the sculpture.4. Chapter II Laying Out The FaceHe forms the approximate profile and introduces us to his kitchen knife blade. He pulls back flaps of clay to form the inner part of the eye sockets. ( It is an interesting question how much detail one would put in the profile when doing a portrait of a particular person. Adam's profile in this demonstration is rough. Although he emphasizes leaving the initial profile undisturbed, he is willing to modify it. Later, he changes the slope of the forehead and adds clay to the point of the chin.)5.

Chapter XIII Part 1 Finishing The Form Part 115. Chapter XIII Part 2 Finishing The Form Part 216. Chapter XIII Part 3 Finishing The Form Part 3On my copy of the DVD, this track hangs when finished17. Chapter XIV Final TouchesI rate this DVD set as four stars out of five to indicate that it is a good explanation of how to sculpt a generic head and learn its important landmarks. Whether Adam Reeder's method will suit a given student, I cannot say. Potential buyers can get a preview of the method by looking at Adam's demonstrations on the web.",

She provides thorough information on pre-labor and labor that equips parents for what to REALLY expect. She also offers the pros and cons of medication commonly used during labor that many OBs do not tell you. I appreciated her humor: she makes you laugh at the events of pregnancy and childbirth that we (women) complain about. She has a great teaching style that I think benefits the fathers and helps them to understand and remember what will happen during the course of labor and delivery.",

The video is a little over 4 hours long, and we were highly entertained so it only took us 2 days to watch it. Sheri repeats the information to help with understanding, and the class asked questions which we were thinking about.We were also happy that she did not add any real births since we can watch that on the Discovery Channel. The video is well made and wonderfully informative. I am still nervous about childbirth, but it's not from a lack of what to expect. My husband enjoyed this video and the breastfeeding video by Sheri so much that he asked me to purchase her entire series. This from a man who waited 3 weeks to watch the video with me because he wasn't all that interested. Now he feels prepared and ready to assist me when our baby is born.",

Neither the instructor or parents are actors. Nothing is scripted, Sheri is just teaching the class as she has aparently done many, many times before. The parents are also definately not models, indeed the look of them provided me and my husband with the \"laughter\" part of the video.This is definately very low budget, as if they said, \"Hey, let's make a video of one of your childbirth classes!\", rented a small studio and pulled a few couches together. The visual aids are the same as a real class, drawings on poster board.As to being annoying, well, she can be. It was better that is was just her natural personality than if she had been some actor poorly tring to be funny and being annoying. She is blunt and to the point, somewhat loud, and relates stories she's heard/experienced in her professional career as a nurse that she found amusing in the same way. When you realise she's from New York her accent makes much more sense. Overall, she was not too annoying to watch, and really not that bad.The information makes everything worth while. It goes over everything you could think of, and I feel much better prepared. I watched the entire video immediately after I recieved it, and am benifiting still by rewatching it with my husband (at a much slower pace of one segment per week).If you cannot attend a childbirth class, I would reccomend this video. This would also be a good reference if you wanted to review a certian aspect of birth/afterbirth. It's not the glitz of Hollywood, but it does get the job done.",

One wonderful aspect about the DVD is that you are able to advance at your own pace - Watch the DVD in one day or take a 'class' a week, whatever works with your schedule. Two components offered at local childbirth classes and unavailable on the DVD were breastfeeding techniques and a tour of the local hospital. Hospitals should be accomodating about arranging visits and there are plenty of breastfeeding resources available (books, videos, La leche leagues, and lactation counselors). I would definitely recommend this DVD to others.",

I was very pleasantly surprised--I thought her wry sense of humor and presentation were an excellent match to the material, and I watched the whole video in two days of viewing. My husband and I had dropped out of our local childbirth class because we found the nurse there to be incredibly annoying and full of scare tactics, and this was exactly the tone I wanted--informative, entertaining, and fast-paced. My one issue is that I would like to have had footage of labor, as many childbirth class videos seem to include that, and it might have been useful. For simply getting the basic information, though, I thought this was excellent.",

My wife was doing her residency while she was pregnant, and we just couldn't sign up for regular classes. This video really prepared us for our son's birth, and answered a lot of questions we had.

I was able to give birth to my son without pain meds which I think had something to do with being comfortable with the process that my body was going through (which I learned about from this DVD as well as from birthing books such as \"Natural Childbirth The Bradley Way\").

I'm using a lot of her information to help write out my birth plan. The only negative thing I can say about it is the sound. She gets a lil loud sometimes - which is fine, but the sound guy obviously couldn't cope with it and so he cranks down the sound, so you end up having to crank the sound on your tv up just to hear her (by the end of the DVD our sound was all the way up).

I agree completely with other reviewers who said the background is boring, the participants are not enthusiastic at all, and the camera shots often fail to zoom in on what she is referring to. And Sheri herself is a bit annoying. She tries to be humorous, but the fact thats she thinks her jokes are funny is about the only funny part about her. My husband and I did get a few laughs between ourselves when making fun of how cheesy she is. But all in all, she is well meaning and very informative.

I have already bought it as a gift for friends and plan to continue sending it as the IDEAL present. A onesie or blanket is great, but this is the gift of knowledge and it is GOLD.The instructor is EXTREMELY knowledgable, but she relays the information that you need to know in a very understandable way, making us familiar with the terminology that medical practitioners use (and will be using at the hospital).She is also very comprehensive. Covering soup to nuts the range of issues that we can expect. We went to the hospital's similar class series last week, and it was thoughtful and good, but there was no comparison with respect to comprehensiveness. If all we had was the hospital's prep, I feel like we would have been going into this experience... ill-equipped.Know that it doesn't just cover childbirth, but also breast feeding and things to expect after the baby comes. All of these things are such the mystery when you have never done it before, and she takes the mystery out.For you mothers with partners that get queezy on these subjects, your partner will be fine. I am married to one of those and it was not an issue AT ALL. In fact, the instructor has such a great sense of humor that we laughed through most of the series. And when you learn in a fun way, you remember it. And he actually had fun.Once you have the video, if you want to rewatch a subject closer to time, you can. That has been useful too, as there's a lot to know!I feel badly because as much as use amazon reviews, I never write them. But on this video, I felt compelled to let expectant parents know just how valuable this investment is.",

With only 3 weeks to go we found ourselves in quite the predicament when it came to knowledge of childbirth! This was a great way to experience childbirth classes in the privacy of your own home while lounging around! We did not feel constrained for time and could watch the classes when they were convenient for us. My sister just had a baby and watched some of the classes with us. She had endured the long, boring, and inconvenient classes at the hospital and wishes now that she would have known of this video! The information was so helpful and I feel like I have so much more control over my pregnancy and labor and delivery. I will not, however, lie and tell you the classes were all roses to sit through. As most people have stated, Sheri's humor (if that's what you want to call it) can be somewhat annoying at times. If you can just ignore her goofiness and absorb the information she is giving, this is the perfect childbirth class experience.

I actually ended up going into labor and delivering my first, a baby boy the day after I finished watching the DVDs and I have to say I learned A LOT from these DVDs and do not regret one bit not attending a childbirth class.Firstly one comment I read that made me question buying this was the corny sense of humor the teacher has. It is not that bad and she does a good job of being lighthearted while making sure you understand points that she wants you to take seriously.The content is also excellent, and I used a lot of tips she gave during labor such as how to position yourself more comfortably during contractions, checking the color of water when it breaks (green means go to hospital immediately), start timing your contractions, time water breakage, what an apgar score is, what dilation means, and tons more.She makes a good case for not having an epidural, I ended up not having one mainly because I was 9.5 cm dilated when I got to the hospital and I recalled from the video there would be very little gain for getting an epidural at that point. The doctor also mentioned (as was mentioned in the video) that part of the reason I delivered so quickly (less than 2 hours after arriving at hospital) was because I was able to feel more when pushing without the epidural. That being said, had it been a different situation and I knew I had hours of pain to go at the hospital I very well may have had the epidural, so don't feel that this video will talk you out of an epidural if you are set on it.Bottom line-this DVD is definitely worth watching.",

She makes all women in labor seem like either cowards and idiots, especially the ones who (god forbid) take pain meds. Honestly, you could learn the same info reading \"What to Expect\" or getting a different DVD.",

I had my tv almost on max volume just to hear.The information is ok, but several years old and new studies are showing controlled breathing beats all the patterned breathing that is taught here. Also, the NY accents get old fast. Again, I really expected more from a $50 DVD. Save your money and buy a book! Also, there's a typo on the back cover, which appears to have been put together on a home PC. The DVD looks like something I would burn. Not high quality stuff.",

Disappointed with the couple-of-minute quick coverage of comfort measures. Disappointed for a couple of times I saw probable product placement (for example, a particular cord blood banking company was highlighted longer than the comfort measures). Disappointed when I heard advice that goes against latest medical evidence. And especially disappointed with the number of times I heard the educator say something that made me cringe as it might disempower women. As an alternative or addition to a hospital class, I'd recommend women look into an out-of-hospital childbirth class who works for you, not the hospital - Lamaze, Bradley, Hypnobirthing, Birthing From Within, Birthworks...there are many to choose from. Read up on their philosophies, see what educators are available in your area, and choose one that works for you. If no classes are available or work with your schedule, there are great books out there about childbirth - I'd start with \"Pregnancy Childbirth and the Newborn\", \"The Birth Partner\", \"Birthing From Within\" or \"Ina May's Guide to Childbirth\" depending on your plans for birth.",

But we found it added a lot of color to the information and the anecdotes were also helpful. However, this small issue does not compare to the wealth of information gathered in this video. My husband and I were definitely prepared when we went into labor, we knew what the doctor's and nurses were talking about, and we knew what questions to ask. The video made both of us much more comfortable with the whole process and would definitely recommend this for expecting parents.*Side note: there is one husband who doesn't speak any English, so we were able to make jokes throughout the video about why he was even there & what he must be thinking, so you can look forward to that as well.

The Laugh and Learn About Childbirth DVD totally blew away the in-person class. The information in the DVD is better prepared, more organized, and very comprehensive and Ms. Bayles is cheerful and fun to listen to.When I was pregnant with my second child in 2010, I opted for a natural home water birth (instead of the hospital) and watched this program again. It was a helpful refresher and I used several of the breathing techniques that Ms. Bayles taught during the active labor, transition labor, and pushing phases. So helpful!

The entire DVD set is over 4 hours and I think it EASILY could have been half that length.My only other issue was that she was extremely biased toward not getting an epidural and after having done a lot of research on my own, I don't believe that all of her opinions are fact. Same thing with the cord blood banking. Seems like there is some sort of partnership/sponsorship going on there.I would still recommend - just be ready to fast forward or multi-task through some sections.",

I am not agree with some reviewers, who say that she is so against epidural, etc...I also didn't find anything annoying in her way of humor. She explains pluses and minuses of epidural, etc and you decide anyway. She captures everything you need to know, could be concerned about, etc. She describes it on special presentation stands and her explanations are very easy to understand. I watch this DVDs (2 DVDs in one set) over and over, just to make sure I remember what I need to remember. :) Now I know: signs of labor, medications are used, what to do and when to do, what to expect and not to be afraid of.I highly recommend this DVD to everyone, especially First time moms!

I can't imagine a class would've been any more detailed or helpful and it was so great to just pop this DVD in and watch it at my own pace, in my spare time and in my own home. Also, I now have it as a reference and after I give birth I intend to pass it on as a gift for my next friend who has a baby. The instructor was fun and although a little cheesy at times, you can tell she really knows her stuff and loves what she does. Also I felt like she gave a fair shake to women who want to have an epidural and women who don't. The setting for this DVD is the instructor and 5 expecting couples and I would like to say that it really does a great job at including the husbands, which I find really important.

She tells annoying stories that she thinks are funny but they are not and distract from the infromation she is imparting. You could learn all the significant infromation in half the time if she would cut out the anecdotes and the smug \"I know more than the doctors atitude.\"You are much better off buying a book on the subject or a video by someone who knows she is a nurse and not an annoying wannabe comedian. She also brags too much about her twins delivery. She has to learn that its not about her but the wonder of the birthing process.",

    "review/text": "I got this DVD because I had no interest sitting around with a bunch of pregnant ladies and their significant others, breathing weirdly together. Plus my husband and I just aren't up for going to classes, I'm not sociable and he is tired from work as am I.We started watching this last weekend, and I love it, it definitely makes me think about the ease of pregnancy. The instructor has a lot of experience and it is shown throughout the classes. She is also funny about it which keeps me at ease. The only thing her and I don't have in common is that I don't want a natural birth, (I don't have a high tolerance for pain, does anyone?). But she isn't pushy about her view, which I like. Anyways, if you are looking for a dvd class that teaches you about what is going to happen leading up to the last few weeks to the day of pregnancy and what to expect, this is for you. My husband even enjoyed it.They only share one breathing technique, and the rest of it is visuals on what to expect with contractions, the stages of birth before even getting to the hospital and just gives you an ease on what you can expect when it's time to go to the hospital.It's worth the money!",

I must say that this 2-DVD class is very informative and educational; the first disc anyways. I actually enjoyed the humor of the instructor although it was cheesy at times.I was a little disappointed as she only provided one breathing technique and I didn't care much for the second disc as the information on this disc I already knew but the first disc is good.Overall, I think this is an excellent DVD for the first time mom but the second time mom might not get much out of it besides a little knowledge of anatomy and signs of labor (which you already know).",

    "review/text": "I've always enjoyed Amazon.com's service and will continue to purchase items from the webpage. I'm sad that this last product I purchased wasn't enough for what I wanted. I will start with the positives, first, though. I liked the straight forwardness of the information being given on this DVD. I liked the setting with the different couples. I liked the visual aides and explanations of what to expect for labor and delivery. What I could have done without is the sometimes too much information about how amniotic fluid smells or comments about bodily functions that are not really relevant to pushing a baby out.Now, my purpose for even purchasing the DVD in the first place was to learn the lingo that nurses and doctors throw around when tending to someone in labor, like +2 station and 75% effaced. This gets explained beautifully in the DVD. I wish there had been more explanation of breathing techniques, however, or more demonstrating of them being used in actual labor as I couldn't realistically see the benfit of them. You're gonna breathe hard during labor anyway. I have had six children already and am on my seventh, but only had the sixth one of my kids pushed out without drugs, only because my labor was so fast. By the time I got to the hospital, I had progressed in my labor far enough that my doctor did not arrive in time to deliver my baby. I had no idea I was ready to push upon arriving at the hospital because I always went to the hospital at the very beginning of labor and then got an epidural to take care of pain the rest of labor and delivery, so I never knew what my body was really going through since the epidural blocks ALL sensations of the lower half of your body.This DVD supplies very basic information on labor and delivery. It's good information, but basic. I'm glad it was only $40. I believe one needs as much information as one can possibly get concerning childbirth. I had no idea going without drugs during labor and delivery was so much better than with them. The recovery to get over the drugs in the body is not very fun when you really are trying to enjoy your baby but are so doped up that you hand your baby off to your spouse to sleep off the drugs. No good. I am happy I purchased the DVD and have the information but, I just want to say, if you're having your first baby, get into a setting you can ask questions or ask others about their experience. This DVD doesn't supply everything you need to know like the new pushing method presented seemed like it took a heck of a lot longer to push out your baby than the more direct pushing method you see on TV programs. I wish the DVD explained why the new way was better more.I have learned that one will always learn something new everytime one has a baby. It's inevitable, believe me. This was a nice starter program, but make sure you do get all your questions answered before you are in the middle of labor, is my opinion after viewing this DVD.",

We are told that this is \"normal.\"Well, getting ripped off is \"normal,\" therefore I suppose I agree that a defective video sold for $31 can be \"normal.\"The actual DVD footage has such a loud annoying buzz that no sensible person would consider it \"normal.\" The fact that Sheri Bayles and \"Expect This, L.L.C.\" are willing to sell a defective product clues us in to the fact that the advice in this DVD is going to be bad.The first scene of the DVD features Sheri Bayles sitting with some couples who will be participating in the video. Ms. Bayles gets the \"Laughs\" she promises by mocking her guests for their supposed ignorance about newborns. Ms. Bayles mocks an Hispanic man who is her guest because his English language skills are not up to her standards.In other words, the \"laughing\" is going to be due to mean-spirited mocking jokes pointed at her guests and intended to make the viewer feel guilty for watching a birth class video.It's a terrible video.

It might be one million times better.This \"Laugh and Learn About Childbirth\" video is a complete waste of your money. Watching it will make you feel bad about yourself. Paying for it will make you feel bad about yourself. Do not buy this video.",

My husband learned a lot from the basic information segments, though if you have read pregnancy, labor and childcare books you probably won't. I was disappointed that they didn't show an actual birth because I wanted my husband to see it, but overall if you are looking for a childbirth class you can do at home, this one isn't bad.",

Well, with the due dat looming my wife started to suffer from extreme anxiety issues. We still didn't want to take a class and figured we still didn't have time anyways. So into good old Google goes \"dvd lamaze\" I think this DVD's website is the first hit. Lot's of positive reviews posted from Amazon on this site. I'm not willing to dish out for this thing still. Luckily our a few of our local libraries had it in.The DVD was good for relaxing my wife's anxiety. But we both found Sheri Bayles extremely annoying, she was really trying hard to be a comedian - unsuccessfully. The high pitched voices she used in imitating expectant mothers made me wince. And all of this extraneous 'comedy' made the video overly long. Unfortunately you couldn't just fast forward through these spots because she would quite often throw good bits of info in with these routines.Another negative is that she quite often reccomends deferment to the doctor for decision making. Something my wife and I aren't willing to do - especially regarding the likes of episiotomies.Plus she spreads her legs so often showing off one of the biggest camel toes making me wince some more.",

Yes, the instructor has sort of an unusual sense of humor--but she gives you tons of information, answers the questions you'd ask if you were there in person, and addresses the issues you were unaware of or might be afraid to ask about.

    "review/text": "My wife and I originally signed up for several classes about childbirth, infant care, and breast feeding at the hospital she'd be giving birth at. We attended the infant care classes first, which we didn't find very helpful - due to the way the class was run. We then found out that our childbirth classes were being moved around and that created some scheduling issues for us. After my wife read some other women's opinions on the live childbirth classes online we decided to purchase this video instead of attending the classes.Boy was it worth it. First off, you can watch this in the comfort of your own home. So after a long days work you don't have to drive however long to your hospital, sit under the hazy florescent lights for two hours trying to absorb as much as you can. You can watch this video as much as you want, and if you forget something you just watch that section over again. And if you do have questions you can always ask the OBGYN.Secondly, she covers everything! The DVD is over four hours long, but it is divided into six sections so you don't have to watch it all in one sitting. She gives pros and cons to various topics like medication, natural vs cesarean birth , etch. In other words, it's not one sided.She makes it fun too by injecting humor into the teaching. It's not just a boring documentary on childbirth. I especially found the sections on the female anatomy, terms about labor, etc, and how the baby is situated within the mother very helpful - hey I'm a guy :)I suppose it ultimately depends on how you learn best. If you would rather go sit in a room with other people you don't know, an instructor who may structure the class in a way you don't like, then go for it. But for my wife and me we took the video route and picked this DVD b/c of the positive reviews.You won't be sorry, Get this Video. And for all you mothers to be reading this review, this review is coming from the perspective of a guy so you may want to share it with your husband/partner. If a guy like me found it very useful (and I'm not even the one having the kid) then think about how useful it will be for the mothers to be.",

My ob/gyn recommended this DVD and I can say it's definitely been informative - the set-up is a class situation so it seems like the viewer is just another class member in an intimate setting - and educational, especially for first-time parents who have no clue what to expect. Bayles has a lot of experience and you can tell she's no stranger to these classes, but what makes them very hard for me to watch is that she seems to make fun of people a lot and that really irks me and distracts me from the subject matter. I'm all for a little light humor and a casual approach to a serious subject here and there, but she really goes overboard with it, going so far as to tell stories of things previous clients have done or said, as if they're just so stupid and oh isn't it so much fun to laugh at these people who are, by the way, just like you. I've learned to fast forward or mute when she goes into her little stand-up routines (they're easy to see coming because her face goes slack and she does this really goofy voice) until she gets back to the stuff I'm actually interested in learning about. I haven't tried out other childbirth DVDs, so I can't compare, but if I had to do it over again, I'd probably skip this one due to her style and spend my money elsewhere.",

For instance, she covers, and jokes about, the breaking of one's water and the dreaded loss of bowel control during delivery as a means to show that neither are anything to fear; they are natural occurences.

Otherwise, they are terrific and I would definitely recommend them.",

    "review/text": "This DVD set far exceeded my expectations. My husband and I live overseas, and childbirth class options are limited (and in another language), leading us to seek additional avenues of learning about the process and our options. We are aiming for a natural childbirth, but are using a common-sense approach, so we also want to be informed about all our options related to pain relief. This DVD set provided exactly that. Sheri (the host) does not conceal the fact that in low-risk pregnancies, she favors unmedicated childbirth, but nor does she try to shove it down your throat. She addresses the epidural and its potential risks / side effects, and then advises that for those who do choose to get the epidural, there is a \"right time\" to get it. She presents the information in an organized, list-like fashion, which allowed me to boil down all the salient points to a few 3x5 index cards, which I plan to take with me to the hospital, and have referred to constantly in the final months of my pregnancy. For example, here's how a couple of my index cards read:PRE-LABOR:1. Pelvic Station: baby's descent (at 37 weeks, ask doc about baby's station)2. Effacement: thinning of cervix, measured by % (the thinner it is, the faster it opens). First-timers efface, then dilate; second-timers dilate then efface.3. Dilation: how wide cervix is open.6 Preliminary Signs of Labor:1. Braxton-Hicks Contractions2. Weight Stabilization - 2 weeks before labor3. Burst of energy for 48 hours - 2 weeks before labor4. Baby drops - pee all the time, breathe again (after 36 weeks)5. Increased discharge.6. Diarrhea - night before going into labor.3 Actual Signs of Labor (must have TWO of THREE for it to be labor):1. Loss of mucous plug.2. Breaking water. (When this happens, sit down, note time, call doctor, green means go to the hospital right away.)3. Contractions. (Measured from start to start.)CONTRACTIONS:Call doc: when 5 minutes apart for one hour (for first-timers). Every 5 minutes = cervix dilated 1-3 cm.Go to hospital: when can't talk through contractions. ENJOY down time.She also reviews in detail the three stages of labor, the three phases of stage one labor, the progression of contractions, breathing and pushing techniques, comfort measures for mom, pain medication options, emergency delivery, and much more. I highly recommend this DVD set, particularly for those who are unable to or opt not to attend a childbirth class. From what we've found, this DVD set really is the next best thing.",

Some of it was actually quite humorous because I could relate to what they were talking about. I can't really say whether the information helped in the end because I didn't end up needing the information (I ended up having an emergency c-section a month early) but after watching the DVD I definitely felt more ready for the experience and learned many new things. I really liked that they had a bunch of pregnant couples in the video and not just one person talking. I definitely recommend this DVD. It's easy to watch and they make sure you understand everything before they move on. Plus, unlike the live classes, you can rewatch this as many times as you want/need.",

One of my clients, a 19 yr. old went to a wedding three hours away from her home thinking she still had two weeks before the baby was due. Her doctor said he thought it would be OK. As God would have it, her water bag broke just before the ceremony and she was rushed to the local hospital where she gave birth just a few hours later. She told me the next day that though she was at a strange hospital with a doctor she didn't know, she felt very confident because of the preperation she received at our center. That's just one of many comments we've received. Our whole office loves these DVDs.",

I appreciated that she covered every stage from a few weeks before labor to what to expect the first 4-6 weeks after delivery, giving information about both C-section and natural birth. We skipped the sections on \"cord blood banking.\" She's easy to listen to, a natural teacher, and with a great sense of humor too.I just wish she had made even a few passing comments on delivering multiples, since she herself is the mother of twin boys, and I was disappointed she didn't address multiple births at all.",

Also, look at the Business of Being Born video by Ricki Lake it is also very informative.",

I tend to fast forward when she goes into her \"funny story\" mode.

Being that we are a couple with a great sense of humor, and don't like to take anything too seriously, \"laugh and learn\" sounded like the right choice. Honestly, we both found this woman-Ms. Bayles- to be extremely annoying with her stories and condescending atttude. She constantly made fun of the people she was talking about...especially the men. We were expecting a nice take it easy approach to lamaze, but we found ourselves rolling our eyes at every digression. Although, I have to say that she is quite knowledgeable and if she would stick to the facts and not try so hard to be funny, this would be a worthwhile dvd. By the way, I never write reviews, ever.",

Unless you have been living under a rock somewhere, her accent should not be offensive in any way. After reading some reviews, I put the DVD in expecting to hear The Nanny talking. It is nothing so harsh as that. If you do not have time, energy or desire to take a class then this DVD is a perfect alternative.

The lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in REALLY learning about childbirth. She explains everything. How your body should be functioning, what is stretching, what liquids to look for as signs of this and that, charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly it's growing and she even quizzes the husbands! There is so much to learn. Open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though, it's like four or five hours long. PHEW. But it probably wouldn't be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway. It is a lot of information to grasp. Enjoy!!",

Yes, it is true that this might be more convienient and cheaper than the child birth classes (which is why we got the DVD), but it does have it's drawbacks.My first concern- all of the couples do not represent different age groups. It seems that all of them are in their late 30's or 40's, which doesn't represent a true range of people that would be at the class. I am 27 years old, and would love to see some couples that my husband and I can relate to. I know there are several pregnant women my age (or younger), so they should have a mixed group...I know that it was taped somewhat recently also, so that surprises me with the choice of couples. Why also are some of them seperated from each other? For some reason, that really bothers me!Yes...Sheri can be very annoying at times. My husband and I get very frustrated at her imitations of pregnant women. I keep telling my husband, please don't let me sound like that when I am having our baby. I was expecting a lot more visuals, instead of just a taping of a class with poster board. Maybe I was misled by the explanation or the title. I was suprised to see it like a classroom set up, with no other visual aides other than the ones she holds up.Although there are several annoyances of the video, I am learning some informative tips, and pertinent information. I still am glad I chose not to go to a class, just so it can be a little bit more personal and laid back with just the two of us.",

    "review/text": "The instructor is one of the most annoying people we've ever forced ourselves to sit through - my husband and I had a tough time not just turning it off and getting the info elsewhere. She really seems to think she's funny but is instead really just patronizing and sometimes seems rather insulting of the basic intelligence of the people in the class. It really is hard to sit through.After reading Ina May Gaskin's \"Guide to Childbirth\" and really internalizing the value of having positive messages surrounding you while in labor, I was so annoyed & disappointed (actually threw a few pillows at the tv) when Sheri kept harping on how painful birth has to be, and how she as a nurse sends people home from the hospital in early labor \"because they're not in enough obvious pain yet\" (rather than the more positive way of saying they would be better off laboring at home for the time being in a more comfortable setting.) The camera would then of course cut to one of the women in the group who had a deer-in-the-headlights look (again), and we all see that Sheri has once again successfully freaked out a woman who should instead be entering labor with an empowering \"I can do this\" attitude. I have to wonder how a couple of these women made it through their labors - they seemed very overwhelmed by the negative messages by the end of all the classes. It's a shame, and I found myself freaked out needlessly during the video, and am back to Ina May's book for my last 2 weeks of pregnancy to try to get Sheri's unfortunate messages out of my head. I'm also having my husband and mother read that book before my labor so that they understand what a huge impact your surroundings and the messages conveyed by the people there have on the progression of a labor. If Sheri was my nurse I would likely end up with all of the medical interventions she listed just due to her abrupt manner.I have to admit that it is helpful to view an informational video in addition to all the reading one does in preparation for labor- I just wish I knew about a better one somewhere.",

The teacher is qualified and just funny. She keeps you interested and gives the info in easy to remember ways. I like that there are five couples in the class, so you still get the worries and questions that other new parents could only provide. The interaction is great and you can stop and start the dvd at you convenience. I will say that it held my interest so much that I watched the entire first dvd without stopping!

It would have been nice to have Postpartum Vaginal Delivery as a separate section, or to have that part talked about first so it would be easier to watch without FF through all the c/s stuff, but with the taglines that pop-up throughout the sections, it wasn't hard to resume Play at the correct time.Highly recommending this one to my pregnant friends!

My mom looked it up here on Amazon, and it was cheaper, and it qualified for free S&H, so that was a bonus. I love this DVD. It has alot of good information, and Sheri makes it fun by making jokes about different things. I also like that she's teaching 5 couples (one of which already has a child), that way she's not just talking to the camera. After going over some information, she \"quizzes\" the couples on the information they have just learned. I like this, because it feels like an actual childbirth class.",

    "review/text": "let me start off by saying...if you looking for a labor dvd that uses breathing techniques and isn't judgmental if you will be having an epidural or not...THIS IS THE DVD!!! I am 37 weeks pregnant and i def plan on having an epidural but i also wanted some sort of direction and help with breathing techniques and helping cope with labor pains. My husband works alot and there was no way he could make it to weekly meetings at the lamaze class. So i decided we needed SOMETHING to help me and i wanted him to know what was going to happen and what he could do to help. This DVD is great. It goes through the stages and everything. 2 dvds. Its great also because you dont have to watch them all the way through. Only how much you want. Although my husband uses this as an excuse and falls asleep. Maybe its not such a good idea when your husband fall asleep so easily but i def recommend it. So happy with this DVD. The only CON if you could call it that, was that the instructor is always making little jokes. Not very funny sometimes but tolerable.",

She also brought a great sense of humor to both pregnancy and delivery related topics, which put my mind & my husband's at ease as far as what the process ahead of us. Afterwards, I ordered her breast-feeding & baby care dvd's and enjoyed those as well. I'm at my 39th week and feel well informed for my pregnancy & caring for baby after Sheri's dvd classes. Not everybody has the time or money to go to actual classes, so this was a convenient alternative from the comfort of my own home.",

However, the video was done with real couples so they were asking questions that we would have asked anyways. The instructor is great, funny and knowledgeable.Whatever you do, don't skip getting educated whether that's via class/book/video. However, I feel the video is a good compromise between reading a book and attending a real class. It also saved us some diaper money and we can also watch it again as a refresher.",

She is very outgoing and makes learning the information fun. We were laughing half the time.After going through the process myself I have to laugh even more because she was right on with how I felt during labor.She encourage natural childbirth, but goes over all options.I am about to have my second child and can't wait to watch it again and review. Her other videos aren't bad, but not as good as this one.You wont regret buying this:)",

Don't get me wrong some of the humor is corny and seems set up, but it makes some of the content much easier to relate to. For instance at one point the instructor talks about the mucus plug, and rather than go on with some nasty details she gave some really funny stories to break up the tension and make the video actually interesting and educational.

The information is reasonably good, as far as I can tell. But the woman teaching the class has an annoying New York accent, and she's trying to be funny but mostly isn't. In fact, she seems to make fun of previous patients, and that's off-putting to me. Also, the section on cord blood banking including a big plug for a particular company, and that made me wonder if she was being paid to do that.That being said, the information itself is good and she conveys a lot of it. I just don't care for the format or the teacher so much, and I think more visual aids would have helped rather than just looking at the teacher all the time. I'd have preferred a more multi-media approach.",

From my point of view, being a labor and delivery nurse, this video goes over everything you need to know. From early labor signs, to breathing techniques, to pain control, to postpartum and more! I highly recommend this video! It goes over everything that you would learn in a childbirth class, but from the comfort of your own home!One thing I would like to add to the video is when it talks about when to call your doctor. Sherri (the instructor) says to call your doctor when you are contracting every 5 mins and can no longer talk through the contractions, I would check with your doctor for their labor calling guidelines.",

The purpose of us buying this was to gain understanding of what's in store for our first childbirth, not to be entertained. If she didn't have some of the comedy and antics this would be a really boring dump of straight knowledge like a college course or something. I think she does a great job overall in the DVD mixing facts, concerns, choices, questions, and keeping us paying attention with some comedic examples and editorial.I would recommend this to any of my friends/family.

    "review/text": "I watched the 2003 edition in preparation for the birth of my first child and have just watched the 2007 edition in preparation for the next baby's arrival.I highly recommend either or both DVD's but there are in my opinion a couple of important omissions in the 2007 versions as compared to the 2003 but also some improvements.Improvements:Sheri's humor has improved:DAudience/students are easier to identify with (more current).Generally a bit clearer explanations.Better explanation of c-section especially the recovery process.Advice for second time moms.More thorough explanation of the side effects of an epidural.Omissions/cons in 2007 version:Actual breathing techniques aren't as thoroughly explained.How to push/deliver a baby is completely missing.Judgmental towards the need for an epidural.One-sided (pro) information on cord blood banking.With the information from the 2003 DVD (and good genes) I was able to have a natural and fairly quick birth (about 25 minutes of pushing). I recommended the DVD to my best friend who had her first baby a few months later. She had to have pitocin, then an epidural, but with the info from the DVD (on how to push when you can't feel anything), still felt she had an easy birth (12 minutes of pushing). Neither of us took any classes but obviously had prenatal care where we could ask any questions that arose.Though the 2003 version is duller to watch I'd actually recommend it over the 2007 version. 2003 gives you the knowledge you need for a natural birth, and offers support and advice on how to transition from a natural birth process to one with an epidural. After having watched the 2007 version I'll have to go back to the 2003 version to refresh the breathing and pushing techniques.Good luck!",

I mean, sure its corny at times but I had to admit that this DVD would be horrible without it... and I actually kind of enjoy it :)I am a midwifery student and a first time pregnant mother. My husband works in the oilfield and because of his schedule we were unable to schedule a childbirth class together. I bought this DVD and we LOVE IT! As previously stated, I am a student midwife and even I learned some things from the DVD!! The classes are thorough and interesting, and I find they promote the true naturalness of childbirth.I highly recommend it! I will definately be using this as a resource in my future practice.",

After watching this video, we felt a lot more confident, especially my husband, who was afraid of passing out but turned out to be the greatest coach possible. By practicing and using the breathing techniques taught, I was able to avoid an epidural, of which I was deathly afraid, and have the natural childbirth I wanted.

The instructor is a little corny, but not to the point of being annoying. My only criticism (and it's really not that big of an issue) is that, though she provides enough information about epidurals and c-sections, the instructor's personal slant toward natural childbirth is apparent.

We liked the fact that we can watch the DVD on our own time, and space out the lessons so as to not get too much information thrown at us at once. The price was really great as well compared to the $150 the hospital charges for one full day of class.The DVD is very informative and Sheri definitely teaches the classes with a lot of knowledge and confidence. We feel like we learned a lot and are much more comfortable about the impending delivery.However, it is amazing that this DVD was actually professionally shot. It seems like Sheri's husband or some other friend filmed it. The set and the participants do nothing to enhance the learning and may actually take away from it. The participants seem bored out of their minds and don't participate very much. The set is awkward and unappealing. Sheri herself is quite over-the-top obnoxious and thinks she's very funny, but if you get past this and listen to what she's saying (and not how), you'll learn a lot. All in all very informative, but I think if there were a few more chapters of having to listen to Sheri, we would have strangled ourselves....",

    "review/text": "My husband and I were unable to attend any actual birthing/lamaze classes due to lack of time with our hectic schedule. I've been reading all the materials I could find on pregnancy and labor the past eight months, but felt it was important to have something approaching a \"class\" for me and my husband. This DVD came into my hands after some searching and really fit the bill.RN Sheri Bayles essentially runs a class with five couples--and the viewers are along for the ride. The class is broken into 6 specific sections over two DVDs. Disc 1 covers Preliminary Signs of Labor, Actual Signs of Labor, Comfort Measures and Delivery. Disc 2 covers Medications used in Labor, Cesarean Delivery and Post-op, and Postpartum recovery. Now this is not a fancy DVD with lots of graphics, different locations and special features. It's a fairly straightforward lecture and discussion process on these subjects with occasional diagrams used help visualization. The bare-bones approach could be considered boring, if the viewers are expecting a more hi-tech video, but I found it exactly what I was looking for, since I required a substitute for the actual class. I found Sheri Bayles a good speaker and amusing to listen to--and so did my husband. Sense of humor is very subjective, so this may not appeal to everyone, and if you're considering buying this, see if you can find a way to view some of it prior to buying. Whether or not the humor is to your taste, there's some good information packed into this DVD and I'd recommend it to any couple who has questions and concerns regarding labor and delivery.This isn't a pregnancy overview, and I'm not certain I'd recommend it to those women who have just become pregnant, if only because there's a lot of early pregnancy information to absorb, and focusing on labor and delivery at four weeks along can be more anxiety than a couple needs. Neither is it a comprehensive review of labor and delivery. The material in this DVD is best complemented by books and other DVDs and information from the couple's doctor/midwife. Especially since the downside of the DVD is that you can't ask questions that might arise. The DVD is admittedly biased towards natural childbirth. While Ms. Bayles does discuss medication and medical interventions, providing pros and cons of each, there is a greater preference for natural childbirth when it is safe for mother and baby. Considering the tone some of the Lamaze books published, the bias of the DVD is mild enough that even those considering medicated delivery should gain plenty of information, but they should be aware of the bias.The main detractor from this DVD is the commercial aspect of Cord Blood Banking. While this is clearly a new and fairly hot topic in the world of pregnancy and delivery, Ms. Bayles is a strong supporter of banking cord blood. Without this \"Special Feature\", the overall class structure feels genuine and interesting, but the inclusion of this information turns the DVD a bit too commercially driven at the end. This isn't a cheap DVD, and this so-called \"Special Feature\" can cheapen the experience viewers have. Cord blood banking is still highly controversial and questionable for most couples, not to mention expensive! This may be information some couples want to know about, but I found it distracting and irritating on what was otherwise a good quality DVD about childbirth.Bottom line, this is a decent DVD for information, but may not be an investment all couples wish to make. If a couple has already attended classes and read up on labor and delivery, this may just be a reiteration of what they already know. However, for a couple that has questions, especially surrounding natural childbirth and Lamaze, this DVD can be a great resource to answer some of those questions and know what to ask the doctor. I found the humor refreshing and the format simple, but comfortable for our purposes. For expecting parents, some other resources to check out include \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\" (the newest edition), \"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy\" and \"The Expectant Father\".Happy viewing!

I searched the internet and read many reviews on online or dvd childbirth classes, and decided to go with Laugh and Learn about Childbirth DVD. I wanted my husband to be farmiliar with the terms used in labor and the overall process- but at the same time, didn't want to shock or scare him at all. He tends to be a bit nervous around blood and guts!This DVD was great! It was extremely informative and lighthearted. Humor and joking around is used to bring home the important information in a way that my husband appreciated a lot. I like that the DVD is broken up into 6 half hour sessions, so you have watch it on your own time. Although it is meant to be a tool for first time Moms, there is a couple in the DVD who is having thier second child so it can be useful to second time Moms, as well. In conclusion, if you don't have a ton of time for a class, you want a cheaper alternative, your husband is clueless and squimish about birth (no actual lady parts are shown in the dvd!!!)or you may feel more comfortable learning at your own speed in your own home..............I strongly suggest this DVD!!!

    "review/text": "This DVD is divided into 6 classes, just as a regular, live prenatal course would be. The classes are1. Anatomy and Preliminary Signs of Labor (31:45)2. Three Actual Signs of Labor and Two Breathing Techniques (57:50)3. Labor and Delivery (49:25)4. Pushing and Third Breathing Technique (49:25)5. Medications Used in Labor, Induction, Forceps, Vacuum, and Monitoring (56:50)6. Cesarean Delivery, Post-op C/S, and Postpartum Vaginal Delivery (40:50)As a physician, I recommend it. I purchased this because my husband and I had way too much going on (moving, new jobs, etc.) during this pregnancy, and could not find a class that fit our schedule.Sheri Bayles is extremely informative and experienced. She explains everything clearly and with good diagrams and props. She is very organized. She seems friendly.CONS:--Sheri has annoying mannerisms and really wants you to think she's a comedienne. If you can overcome this, you will learn a LOT from her.--The set is really far from being aesthetically pleasing.--Most of the moms don't look like they're REALLY participating; not great models for you. They also look like they stepped out of the 1980s, even though this was filmed in the 21st century.The cons are small, though. This is very informative, if you can get past the annoying mannerisms and overall lack of prettiness to this video.I liked having the classes laid out as a \"real\" class would have been. Sheri does a good job of making one class relevant to the next. I also enjoyed the convenience of this DVD; my husband and I were able to take this to work and play it on our computers, then watch it at home together, then review one final time, something you don't get to do if you take a live class.So...I give it 5 stars for information, organization, and memorable delivery. I only gave it 4 stars overall because of the ugly-to-look-at-ness and the sometimes annoying qualities of the teacher. The information that lies therein is very, very high-quality. I'd buy this DVD again despite its minor shortcomings.",

My wife and I enjoy watching it, and learned a lot. The baby came out like a piece of cake (my wife doesn't agree on that one completely) but we both knew what we where doing)We read the reviews that mostly criticized Sheri's sense of humor but we took a chance. Her humor is not that bad actually. She gets funny and sometimes goes a bit over the edge, however she is very knowledgeable and definitely has a talent of teaching. When she is describing important stuff she is serious and right on the point.Some reviews criticized the quality of film making. I am professional photographer and my wife is an art teacher and we both studied film in college. In our opinion the cinematography part of the video is quite appropriate, informative video doesn't have to be a master piece.Highly recommend it.",

    "review/summary": "helpful facts but biased presentation - think twice if you know you'll need/want intervention in your birthplan",
    "review/text": "This is a DVD set that's full of good factual information that's then clouded by the instructor's biases and obvious corporate sponsorships.The facts: she does a very nice job of presenting critical information that I'm glad I now know - such as the 3 phases of labor and the stages within each, simple breathing techniques that I won't be likely to forget in the moment, etc. Yes, she's a little to full of her own sense of humor but in my opinion that's easily overlooked when you consider that you're getting tons of good information in roughly 4 hours of material. And at least she tried to make the subject matter interesting rather than just dry facts.Biases: she's obviously a very strong advocate for natural birth - no pain meds, no interventions. While she acknowledges that there are sometimes medical reasons that make interventions necessary and describes the interventions well, she does nothing to alleviate the viewers concerns about these procedures and in fact makes you feel pretty bad about \"putting your baby through it\" (not her exact words but definitely her attitude). The pattern for describing an epidural, and inducement, or another intervention goes something like: (a) here is how the procedure works (facts), (b) here's why it's bad for you, (c) here's why it's bad for your baby, (d) oh, and sometimes it's medically necessary, oh well. As someone who knows that she fits into the \"medically necessary\" category I didn't appreciate the judgment and lack of support. I went to my OB with a list of questions a mile long after watching the section on being induced and he countered quite a few of her \"why it's bad for you and your baby\" arguments as extreme cases based on his professional experience and knowledge - I think she's presenting worst case scenarios for these interventions as if they're the most likely outcome. I bought the dvds to increase my knowledge and decrease my anxiety about labor -- I know more than when I started but she definitely did not decrease my anxiety.The corporate sponsorship: she's very obviously a shill for Viacord (a cord blood banking company). I briefly worked for one of the companies (not Viacord but a major competitor of theirs) and I can tell you she presents a very, very one sided argument for cord blood banking. She's not presenting facts, she's using the marketing techniques that all these firms use to convince you to buy this \"insurance\". For some people it may be a wise choice - especially those with a strong family history of diseases that cord stem cells have been proven to treat - but I did not expect to nor appreciate being marketed to in the guise of education, especially since I PAID for this dvd set.All in all, if you can ignore the rest, there's a lot of good factual information here that's pretty well presented. But, if I had known how biased the instructor would be, I would have looked for a different dvd.",

    "review/text": "I was very happy with this DVD set (and in fact just ordered the breastfeeding DVD from the same instructor). I watched it in lieu of attending childbirth classes and do not regret that decision. I had read several books about labor and delivery, etc., and can't say that the video really contained a lot of new information but it brought the information together nicely and made me feel more prepared overall. I also appreciated the fact that the instructor did not spend a lot of time on breathing techniques and did not overly emphasize natural childbirth. Instead, she discussed the desirability of postponing medications until the labor is well underway because of the cascade effect of interventions (which seems sensible to me). But she certainly didn't try to push going natural all the way. As for the humor, it's not anywhere near as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be.",

    "review/text": "The DVD was a welcomed relief for me! I had no clue what a Lamaze class was about and I thought I'd be sitting in front of the TV with my fiance for the entire time doing the \"he he hoo\" bit. That's not it at all! I'm an information junkie and Sheri really explains to you a lot of the medical terms that they'll use that you normally wouldn't understand. Like when someone says, \"Shes 100%, -2 and 3\" it means that you're 100% effaced, the baby has dropped to the -2 station (-4 is when the baby is past the pubic bone) and 3 centimeters dilated.She gives examples of the different positions you can use to birth your little bundle of joy and what makes them work for the different situations. Also there isn't that annoying feeling of her talking directly to the camera since she is talking to the couples on set/class. Yes, she does go overboard with the humor sometimes but only sometimes. There were tons of times I was sitting on the couch just rolling with laughter as she talked about some funny stories that happened to her as a labor nurse and some demonstrations of \"what you should sound like when you call the doctor as your contractions become five minutes apart.\"Overall this is the best information I have gotten during my entire pregnancy and I've spent a small fortune on other literature. I'm bringing my portable DVD player and this video to my birth just so I can feel calmed.",

    "review/summary": "Learn About Labor & Laugh vs. Labor 101",
    "review/text": "I can confidently recommend both Labor 101 or Learn About Labor and Laugh. If I could only choose one I would choose Labor 101. Here's why.Even though they're both informative I am more prone to watch Labor 101 multiple times. I use the relaxation cd almost daily. I'm glad I watched Learn about Labor and Laugh, BUT once is enough for me.Some difference:-Style-Learn about labor and laugh films the dvd in a large room with a number of pregnant couple in attendance. The instructor is addressing those students as though it is a live class. This makes you feel like you're really sitting in on a class. The drawback is that there is a lot of wasted conversation as a result. For example, she goes around the room getting to know each class member and the introductions of a large group takes awhile. Labor 101 addresses you directly and cuts down on small talk.-Content-They both cover the stages of labor, birth options, interventions, breathing and pushing. The pushing segment of labor 101 was more useful to me because you actually watch the pushing stage of labor and hear the doctor coaching and guiding the pregnant woman.-Diagrams-Learn about labor and laugh shows diagrams and picutres using a flip chart while Labor 101 uses digital animation and birth photography to show diagrams. There is far more birth related imagery show in Labor 101. The camera doesn't spend as much time on a talking head.-Watching Birth-There is no birth footage in Learn About Labor and Laugh. You witness two births in Labor 101 and a lot of birth pictures.-Entertainment Quality-Sheri Bayles in Learn About Labor and Laugh tells a lot of jokes. Even though she takes it a bit far like she doesn't quite know when to stop you might laugh in spite of yourself because some of it's true. Labor 101 takes a more serious approach but isn't completely dry either.-Breathing-Learn about Labor and Laugh teaches one way to breath and has you practice during the dvd. Labor 101 covers three options for breathing but recommends slow deep abdominal breathing.-Relaxation-Learn about Labor and Laugh doesn't cover relaxation at all. Labor 101 spends a great deal of time on relaxation and how to voice positive affirmations as well as other tips on setting up a comfortable environment. This created the gap for me. The relaxation cd is the core of your preparation. I could practice every day and experiment with different techniques. I found a favorite but I'm getting better at all of them.-Package-There are 2 dvds in learn about labor and laugh. The first one is helpful, but the second dvd is spent entirely on c-section, postpartum, and reuniting the couples that attended the class after birth. Labor 101 has 1 dvd and two cds. The entire dvd focuses on labor from home to the hospital. Labor 101's All About Labor cd details emotions, behaviors, and physical signs of each stage of labor as well what type of support the laboring woman will need. Labor 101 is more informative on third stage labor (placental delivery) and newborn procedures. It also includes the previous mentioned relaxation cd.-Special Emphasis-Learn about Labor and Laugh spends a significant amount of time on blood banking and labor 101 spends a significant amount of time trying to involve the husband to take the role of coach seriously. Both give an equal and objective amount of emphasis to the pros and cons of medicated versus un-medicated. They both lean toward natural is best.-Review-Learn about Labor and Laugh spends a lot of time repeating, reviewing, and quizzing the students. Labor 101 reviews material by interviewing a doctor or midwife or showing an example in a birth video.Both are a safe bet!",

    "review/text": "We bought this DVD as a refresher course since this would be our second child. Sheri obviously knows her stuff and the DVD was every bit as informative as the actual lamaze class that we attended for our first child. The downside is her delivery (no pun intended). She acts out scenes as if she is the patient and the doctor/nurse which gets annoying over time. She has a New Jersey accent so it is kind of like listening to Fran Drescher as The Nanny tell you about childbirth - but not that extreme (my apologies to anyone from NJ).The other complaint is the sound quality. Because neither Sheri or the participating parents are wearing microphones they just sound far away. It is in a home setting and it sounds like it. It definitely does not have a professional sound quality.Overall, I would recommend this DVD. It is especially good if you want to go back and review a couple of sections a few times (you can never be too sure you had all of the signs of true labor down). We liked the DVD overall but it her delivery got annoying at times. And don't be fooled by the title and cover. It was mostly a serious DVD.

The instructor is sometimes a little annoying but not so much so that it's hard to watch the DVD. One thing that annoyed me a little was that at times I felt more nervous about the birthing process and my ability to handle labor pains after watching segments. When in labor I didn't find the \"intensity\" that she describes to be accurate, personally. I was well able to tolerate the contractions without acting as she often dramatized in the program and managed to give birth without pain meds.

She is certainly animated, but no more so than any other instructor I would expect to see teaching any kind of class like this. I thought I knew a lot about childbirth, because I've read the 'What to expect' book and 'Your pregnancy week by week', but I have learned a lot about labor, in addition to the breathing techniques.

It was nice to be able to pause it and start it whenever we wanted to.

I am very sensitive to that kind of thing, but to tell you the truth she was not bad at all. She is a good teacher that just tries to keep the mood light with some humor. If she didn't do that (humor) then the video, to tell the truth would be very boring. I guess people just like to complain about anything. I tell you that we sure appreciate the fact that this video was an option for my daughter. It sure alleviated alot of her worry and she went into the hospital with knowledge under her belt. There is sure nothing wrong with that. Plus the fact that you can rewatch any section that you feel you need to brush up on. You can't do that with a real class.

Nothing was graphic. Sheri explained everything fully, but there were no close up images of women pushing out babies (like there were in my Child Prep class). Instead, props were used.2. Sheri is very likable, which made viewing fun and I really didn't find her cheesy.3. There is a ton of information in this DVD. Like I said, I learned more from this DVD than I did from my Child Prep classes.4. Sheri gave a lot of easy ways to remember things, for example \"Green means Go\" in reference to Meconium in the amniotic fluid.5. The couples that were present asked a lot of the questions I would have asked, so I never felt like I missed anything.The only negative I can think of is that Sheri is biased towards natural childbirth, however, she fully discusses the different forms of pain relief and when to have them administered.If you want a graphic video that is up close and personal, than this isn't your DVD, but if you want something that will make you laugh, and ease a lot of your fears, than this is a great buy.",

It has answered some of the most basic questions that I have about going into labor and breathing techniques to use. The old fashion, typical movie depiction of breathing (the very fast in and out) always made it look like you'd hyperventilate before birth! And this DVD shows that it's not necessary to breath like that. Her sence of humor, I think, is meant more to make you comfortable talking about gross and intimate topics. She's not really funny, per say, but I did giggle at a few of her antics. She seems very sweet and VERY knowledgable. My husband and I will be much more comfortable heading into labor knowing the pre-labor signs and the actual labor signs. I bought this used so it was less than $13-$15 - WELL WORTH IT!!!",

    "review/text": "This is my 2nd pregnancy. During my first, I left the hospital's course wondering why I had ever considered natural childbirth. When circumstances arose so that induction was required if we were to ensure my husband's presence at our firstborn's delivery, any inkling of attempting to deliver without the epidural also went out the window.This time, DH's work schedule has prohibited us from an in-depth NCB course. While this video is definitely taught from the mindset that childbirth is a natural experience, it is not pushy, just encouraging. The instructor is a little cheesy at times (DH said think \"Coffee Talk\" woman), but she present valuable information for anyone who wants to know the basics about labor and delivery. I would have loved to see more comfort/coping techniques, but I learned more from her than I did from my course at the hospital, and I can always go back and review.Whether your goal is Natural Childbirth or not, this video is informative and encouraging.My main complaint is that both dvd's have a plug for Viacord... not a bad thing per se, since you can skip them, but perhaps a sign that the cord-blood banking company helped pay for the production?",

I like them to know they have options and that childbirth is not some gigantic emergency!I guess if you're wanting the 'oh, I just had a contraction, take off to the hospital for every intervention possible' this video will suffice. But if you want a labor and birth where you're in control, educated, involved in the process, prepared with pain coping techniques or even want an unmedicated birth it's worth your time and money to invest in an out of hospital childbirth class.

    "review/text": "Both DVDs have merit, but if you're planning to go natural buy Labor 101.Labor 101 approaches childbirth like you want to be an informed consumer and aware of all of your options. It shares secrets on pain relief, pressure discomfort, avoiding tearing, positions, and speeding up labor. It gives detailed info on how to cope with certain situations and have discussions with your doctor. There are modest birth scenarios to watch during discussion to help gain a visual understanding as well as some 3D digital animation on dilation, station, and uterine contractions. You'll get clear concise detail on how to breathe filling your diaphragm with slow controlled breaths. It treats you like an active participant in the process of childbirth. It promotes positive affirmations, progressive relaxations, and gives both a history and explanation on the history of childbirth education.Laugh & Learn is humorous and entertaining and gives a good basic overview for people who are curious about what to expect. It doesn't show any births but there are flip charts that show a few pictures on anatomy. You learn stages of labor and when to get an epidural. She recommends big breathy blows and that is the only information you receive on coping. You practice a few pushes by pulling back your legs and pretending to have a bowel movement. There are a lot of potty jokes as you view a staged class that can be somewhat over kill. Perhaps the intent is to reduce fear and make it funny, but this approach leaves you inadequately prepared. That is, it's funny until you get to cord blood banking and then suddenly you get a very serious info-mercial on why you should spend tens of thousands of dollars on all the bad things that will most likely happen to your baby (clearly a paid endorsement). I would recommend this dvd to people who are planning to get an epidural but not feeling like they need to practice or discuss techniques and options.",

    "review/text": "I watched this DVD prior to giving birth to my second child - we weren't able to make it to the local childbirth refresher classes. I was really impressed - wish I had known about it for my first child. It is very informative and comprehensive, with relevant and accurate information presented in a way that makes it easy to learn. The breathing techniques she suggests for getting through labor were by far the best advice I have ever received, and they actually worked (I was 7-8 cm dilated after an hour of labour, and it was actually very manageable, thanks to this DVD) - none of this hee-hee-hoo business, and it was easy to stay calm and focused! She is pro-natural childbirth, but I didn't find this overwhelming or over the top. After all, it is you who has to decide what's best for you and you shouldn't feel guilt about your decision, whether you take advantage of medical intervention or not. It's good to hear thoughts from both ends of the spectrum so that you know your options. She has a pretty goofy sense of humor, but I appreciated it - who wants to sit through a stuffy, boring, serious lecture? Excellent, excellent DVD, highly recommended for mom and dad-to-be or anyone who needs a refresher.",

Nowhere else do they say that a birthing ball will help with standard pregnancy pain, but it worked wonders for my wife!When it came to our birth much of the techniques and advice in the video did not help. Of course every pregnancy and birth is different, but could ours have been so different that most of the video was useless to us?Her video does poke a little fun and is probably more entertaining to watch than others but, I would not recommend spending your money on it.

The instructor presents the information in a way that helps you to make informed decisions about childbirth (medicated or not) without trying to brainwash you one way or another.She is not a professional comedian but she does make you laugh now and then which helps to make the time pass by in a more pleasant way.",

My husband and I have been watching it one section at a time, since each section is between 30 and 45 minutes. There is a lot of useful information, such as early signs of labor, the stages of labor, and alternatives to what she calls \"normal birth\". However, there is definitely a preaching tone about not using any type of medications during labor and even though she discusses them; she definitely makes her opinions known. Still, if you don't have a good child birth class available to you, this is better than nothing. Perhaps balance this with the bookThe Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancyby Vicki Iovine for a different point of view.",

Sheri Bayles herself is wonderfully warm and witty, and her extremely knowledgeable presentation takes much of the scaryness out of being a first time mom (and first time dad, of course!). I will definitley recommend this video to my friends!However, I was surprised and shocked when I read some recent reviews of this dvd. These reviews seem to have been written solely for the purpose of releasing unrelated, build-up personal anger instead of giving other parents-to-be useful comments about the dvd. I understand that not everybody will always give this dvd 5 stars as I did, but I believe reviews should still be written in a reasonable and understandable manner. So anyone who is unsure about buying the dvd should take a look at Amazon's overall rating of this class, which speaks for itself. Thank you Sheri!",

Additionally, the lamaze class we found that may have worked for us was a few hours a night for four consecutive Wednesdays. As many of you know, this becomes more challenging to do after working an 8-10 hour day when you're getting bigger by the second! Needless to say, everything we wanted to know was well explained here. The instructor was knowledgeable and we were able to watch and re-watch at our own pace (which was wonderful). The setting and participants seemed a bit dated, but the information was current and practical. I will be recommending this to all of my friends.Oh - and just one side note. The price may seem high, but when you compare it to the cost of a childbirth education class, it's a bargain. Additionally, you will have it available as a refresher if you decide to have another child.*** UPDATE: I have been meaning to re-review this item since the birth of my first child 13 months ago, and am just getting to it now. I am happy to report that the breathing techniques and instructions on pushing were so helpful, I managed to deliver my son with only 22 minutes of very efficient pushing. The breathing techniques were so valuable considering I was 5 cm when they requested the epidural and 10 cm when they checked immediately after. I did a lot by myself with Suzy's help!

    "review/text": "Dario Argento has somehow escaped the american audience for over 30 years, that is until this recent wave of affordable well distributed re-releases. Stendahl Syndrome is more akin to his &quot;Deep Red&quot;, &quot;Bird With Crystal Plumage&quot; and &quot;Tenebre&quot; than say &quot;Suspiria&quot;, &quot;Inferno&quot; or &quot;Phenomena&quot;. In that it is a fantasy based crime thriller as opposed to a supernatural/occult horror. Starring Dario's beautiful daughter Asia Argento who plays a police officer on the trail of a serial rapist when the tables are turned and she becomes the rapist's latest victim (while any scene involving such violence towards women is certainly disturbing, the film is however nowhere near as brutal as the critics claim). On top of all this Asia's character also suffers from a rare disorder in which great artwork causes powerful hallucinations and blackouts to the viewer. This is apparently known as the Stendahl Syndrome. While not as brillant as most of Dario's work it is far better then his recent adaptation of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; or his other film starring Asia &quot;Trauma&quot;.",

Clearly, this is one of Dario Argento's masterworks, aided by a haunting score by the talented Ennio Morricone.Asia Argento, who plays the heroine, becomes unhinged by her violation. She was not a well woman to begin with, suffering fom a syndrome named after the writer Stendhal that causes her to faint when she views certain works of art that overwhelm her. Her sexual victimization pushes her over the brink of madness, and what ensues is sheer terror. She experiences difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality. Her psychological predicament becomes all the more heinous when reality, in the guise of her assailant who continues to stalk her, becomes more horrifying than the chimeras conjured by her overheated imagination.In its depiction of a woman's descent into madness, this film reminds me of Roman Polanski's \"Repulsion,\" but Dario Argento's film is richer and fuller, whereas Polanski's is claustrophobic. \"The Stendhal Syndrome\" is Argento at the top of his game.--Bryan Cassiday, author of \"Fete of Death\"",

    "review/text": "\"The Stendhal Syndrome\" is Dario Argento's hardest movie to watch. The entire movie runs darker and deeper than his better work and leaves the viewers feeling a little, well... sick.Asia Argento is beautiful but totally unbelievable as a cop on the track of a serial rapist. She's totally set up to be victimized and victimized she is. In brutal, graphic fashion. What makes these rape scenes even harder to watch is the knowledge that Dario Argento is directing his own daughter.There are some nice visuals as Asia falls into a painting underwater to share a smooch with an odd-looking fish, and when she steps into a painting of a waterfall. In another scene, a nasty piece of graffiti rips itself from the wall. However, not enough is done with Asia's \"Stendhal Syndrome\"; it just doesn't come as much into play as I would have liked.The plot becomes convoluted and doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and while this is to be expected from an Argento film, it's a little more noticable seeing as how the movie plays more straightforward than his more stylish ventures (Suspiria, Deep Red, Tenebrae).The Troma features are ok on the DVD, including an interview with Dario Argento about Italian horror and a bunch of Troma previews. The picture is a little dark and grainy, making me wish for the crystal-clear clarity of DVD's like \"Suspira\".\"The Stendhal Syndrome\" is not one of Dario's best work, but it's worth seeing if you're a fan. Just be warned: it's not easy to watch.",

    "review/text": "Detective Anni Manni suffers from two things, she can't look at some works of art without fainting into an unconscious fantasy, and there is a homicidal, rapist-killer toying with her. After being brutalized by the madman and having her emotions and memory jumbled, she returns home to try and piece her fragile self back together. Stendhal Syndrome is haphazard mess, struggling to work, yet ultimately failing. Dario Argento presents a bleak film, negative because it lacks the Argento flourish, the stylized touch that made him famous. Aside from the occasional shot here and there, the film is outright flat, brutal, and clumsy. Truly, it is only the outright brutality that makes it interesting. Without that ugly touch to prod at and thicken the skin of the viewer, it is just a dud.What this film reminded me of, in terms of a director slightly shifting in style, was Hitchcock's Frenzy. With Frenzy, Hitchcock directed more violent scenes, nudity, and stronger elements in general, and it is the same with Dario and the overt cruelties in present in Stendhal Syndrome. Gone are the expressionistic tones and otherworldliness that made his violence slick and dreamlike. Instead, Stendhal is just a mean debacle, bookended by a flawed beginning and end, but a good, entertaining middle.The DVD itself is unforgivable. Troma delayed this for quite sometime, witch would lead one to believe they were taking great care with the film. It is perfectly obvious that they probably delayed the DVD only because of all the self-gratifying promos tacked onto it. The transfer is hideous, barely better than video, washed out color, grainy, and horrible contrast. The extra interviews (two with Dario, one with Sergio Stivaletti, and one, for some reason, with Ruggero Deodato?) are done on bad video with bad microphones, and cameramen, who neither know how to sit still, frame, or focus very well. There is a third interview with Dario that is quite good, fine sound and thank god, a cameraman who uses a tripod. If Troma is going to acquire more serious titles by genre filmmakers, they should treat the material with some respect and not do such an inexcusable hack job.",

    "review/summary": "Stylish but Incoherent",
    "review/text": "I am slightly embarrassed to admit that this is my first Dario Argento film. For anyone even remotely interested in horror movies, this admission is not an easy one. I don't really know why I waited so long to watch an Argento film; perhaps it is merely an oversight on my part. It certainly has nothing to do with an aversion to Italian horror cinema; I have seen several films by such notables as Lucio Fulci, Ruggero Deodato, and Umberto Lenzi but never anything from Dario. Argento's body of work is voluminous: he's been making films for over thirty years, with his best work appearing in the 1970s and early 1980s. I'll eventually watch \"Suspiria,\" \"Inferno,\" and \"Deep Red,\" but for my first Argento film I decided to view \"The Stendhal Syndrome,\" mainly because the plot sounded immensely intriguing even for a horror film. The additional factor of Asia Argento in the starring role of Anna Manni definitely didn't hurt, either. Asia is Dario's daughter, an actress whose star is rising with recent appearances in American big budget films.\"The Stendhal Syndrome,\" set in Italy, tells the story of police detective Anna Manni. Anna's latest case involves a serial rapist who with his last two victims added murder to his resume. Regrettably for Anna, this criminal has now set his sights on her. His first move against Manni entails luring her to a museum where she falls victim to an odd psychological malady called the Stendhal Syndrome. Named for the famous French writer Stendhal, this mental affliction causes the sufferer to undergo nausea, headaches, depression, and severe hallucinations when confronted with works of art. In Anna's case, the trip to the museum turns into nothing less than a bizarre interaction with a painting in which Anna perceives herself actually entering the picture for a quick dip in the ocean where see encounters a smoochy fish. Subsequent episodes include walking into a painting of a waterfall and entering a picture only to find herself at a murder scene. The rapist soon plays a cat and mouse game with Anna, driving her nearly mad with his attentions. The game wears Anna down, causing a rift with her policeman boyfriend and requiring periodic visits to a psychiatrist to work through the trauma she suffers at the hands of her adversary. Director Argento plays games with the viewer as well, concealing the implications of Anna's experiences with her stalker until the end of the film. \"The Stendhal Syndrome\" runs for a lengthy two hours, taking turns which are at times fascinating or boring.The most basic problem with \"The Stendhal Syndrome\" is Argento's uneven pacing and a lack of plot coherency. All of the best effects appear in the first thirty minutes of the film, thereby letting the rest of the movie fall into a rather boring montage of scenes until again picking up steam in the last ten minutes. Don't get me wrong; I think this movie is worth watching, but I also feel it is worth watching only for a limited number of scenes. \"The Stendhal Syndrome\" just doesn't work as a coherent film. The plot is hazy at best, with Argento providing more questions than answers. I once read that Argento's plots often sink into a quagmire of confusion, and if this is so, maybe that explains what happened here. All I can say is that a few scenes possess incredibly great power, while the majority of the movie lags far behind. You get the sense you are watching a genius at work, but that he's a lazy genius who lacks the fortitude to carry a great idea to fruition.Sergio Stivaletti did the special effects for \"The Stendhal Syndrome,\" and they are quite impressive. The scenes where Anna suffers through a Stendhal episode look good considering this movie probably didn't have a big budget. Moreover, many of the graphic effects produce cringe worthy moments that should warm the heart of any serious horror connoisseur. An interview on the DVD with Stivaletti discusses in depth the problems and successes of the effects work that occurred during the course of the movie. This was the first time Stivaletti ever used computer graphics, and he did a good job overall.The biggest surprise with this DVD is its release by Troma films. Troma, if you're not aware, is a studio dedicated to producing the worst Z grade junk in film history. One thing Troma does know how to do, however, is release DVD's with lots of extras. There are interviews with Dario Argento here, along with an interview with \"Cannibal Holocaust\" director Ruggero Deodato (why? I don't know), a bunch of trailers for low-grade schlock like \"The Rowdy Girls,\" \"Teenage Catgirls in Heat,\" \"Killer Condom,\" and \"Terror Firmer,\" and yet another one of those Troma Intelligence Tests. Aren't all of these extras great? Maybe so, but Troma technicians botched the transfer of the film. \"The Stendhal Syndrome\" is awash in haze, murky shadows, and grain. In short, the movie doesn't look as good as it should. Troma knows better.I won't let the uneven \"The Stendhal Syndrome\" get me down. All directors have their difficulties, and this film, while far from great, isn't bad either. Asia Argento does a fair job in the lead, although it's difficult to imagine her as a police officer. Be sure and pay attention when Asia dons a blonde wig. She looks so much like Traci Lords that it's scary. Good effects, good gore, a great if repetitive score by Ennio Morricone, and an occasionally interesting plot make \"The Stendhal Syndrome\" a must see for Italian horror fans.",

I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality.

I find that hard to believe. I don't own a DVD of this movie, but as a previous reviewer said, it can't look worse than this.The sound however is excellent, and features the dubbed English version and the original Italian track.The movie itself I found quite good, except for the ending (I'm not an Argento fan, so some of the fans out there might object). I found THE STENDHAL SYNDROME suffered from the same problem that TERROR AT THE OPERA suffered from, it doesn't know when to end.

Asia Argento gives her best here, and unfortunately you can not listen to her real voice, since she was dubbed (despite most people find her voice horrible). Kretschmann is revolting and yet convincing: great phisique du role and twisted minded. Argento brings us inside the Uffizi gallery with the usual elegance is renowned for. Florence has never been so ambiguous.Troma could have helped this movie gain a five-star. But the video quality is scarce and all but clean and the audio track is forgettable. Good job with the extra features, with a commentary section by Sergio Stivaletti (special effects), an interview with Ruggero Deodato (Cannibal Ferox), Lloyd Kaufmann interviewing Argento and Dario being interviewed in Stockholm (find an easter egg!). Senseless, but funny, some Troma tests and trailers.Could have been a Master DVD. Could have.",

Added to that you get fine performances by Dario's daughter Asia and Thomas Kretschmann. But moreover the movie doesn't lack a good story and shows not one narrative weakness throughout it's complete running time. The stringent plot makes it somehow different from almost every Argento flick since. The movie is highly recommended to all fans of the horror-/thriller-genre - you won't be disappointed. And all the earlier aficionados, that didn't waste to much thought about the story, will get their kicks too. After all we're talking about the maestro...",

    "review/text": "The fact that The Stendhal Syndrome, one of Dario Argento's best acted films, is released by Troma on DVD is misleading. The packaging concentrates only on the most sensationalistic of the film's aspects (the gore, Asia Argento's presence in the &quot;Sexiest Women&quot; list of a major men's magazine).And ever since Dario Argento has started aiming for plotting and script (Trauma, The Phantom of the Opera) instead of the random stream-of-consciousness imagery that marks his best works (Suspiria, Tenebre, Inferno), his films have become shakier. The Stendhal Syndrome stands out among his '90s works thanks to a varied performance by Asia Argento, who nails the complexities of the lead character's fears, aggressions, sensuality, and the mix of strength and vulnerability that makes her final fate all the more affecting.The Stendhal Syndrome isn't a great film, but it's certainly worth watching. When it gets under Anna's skin, such as during her pivotal moment of lashing back out at her tormentor, it's powerfully visceral filmmaking.This DVD edition offers plenty of extras, though the lack of a commentary track is somewhat disappointing, and (again) the packaging is quite hideous. But judging from the Argento interview included, perhaps it wasn't a bad idea not to have Dario comment on the film, given his very thick and nearly incomprehensible accent. The DVD menus, however, should've been cleaned up; they're very hard to read, and the chapter division isn't meticulous enough. Why bother breaking the film up into chapters if each chunk is a good seven minutes long?",

    "review/text": "Italian &quot;Master of Horror&quot;,Dario Argento brings us one of his most frightening and realistic films to date. Argento's own daughter, the very beautiful Asia Argento gives an amazing and very chilling performance as a policewoman working with the Anti-Rape league in Rome,Italy.While tracking down a serial rapist in an art museum she succumbs to an illness known as the &quot;Stendhal Syndrome&quot;, an actual affliction named after one of the first reported cases. The illnes causes certain people to become emerced in and hallucinate when in the presents of works of art. After fainting from such an experience, Anna(Asia Argento) is attacked by the rapist she was on the trail of in an extremely unnerving scene,which may be too much for some viewers. The film then takes a drastic change from Dario Argento's early works, which mainly focused on the search for a serial killer knocking off victims one by one. Instead this movie focuses on the victim of a horrible crime and how it dramatically alters and overwelms every aspect of their lives from then on. As the suprises and shocks hit you one after the other Argento showers the screen with some amazing vsual effects and the breathtaking scenery of his beloved Italy. The director apparently took this film as an opportunity to showcase and show-off Italy's proud and wonderous art history (and who could blame him?). Great works of art whirl by you in such a way that you may even experience a case of the Stendhal Syndrome yourself. A beautiful and dark modern &quot;film noir&quot; with an enchanting score by the legendary Ennio Morricone, Stendhal Syndome is truly a one of a kind film exprience from a great director who proves he still has a few tricks up his sleeve. Asia Argento SHOULD have won an Academy Award for her outstanding performance. She is without a doubt one of the best young actress working today.",

    "review/text": "I have read so many reviews {mostly on other websites} saying that Dario Argento's films in the 90s are all disappointing compared to his past masterpieces. I totally disagree. I think Argento has yet to lose his touch.It's just after so many great horror/thriller/mystery movies, you tend to keep comparing all his movies to his earlier masterpieces. Even though The Stendahl Syndrome is not as great as Suspiria, Deep Red, Phenomena, etc., it's still alot better then the majority of thrillers out nowadays.I will not get into the plot and story line because there are plenty of other reviews to go to for that. I just want to go into why I love this film. First off the story and plot {that I just chose to ignore in this review} is pretty original but still has common elements of other Argento films. Second, the scenes where Asia &quot;falls&quot; or &quot;walks&quot; into art are great and I wish there was more scenes like that. The rape and torture scenes are kinda hard to watch but they are not over the top {atleast not by Argento standards} and halfway through Asia gets to turn the tables for a bit. The movie switches between 2 or 3 different overall feels. At first, it's got paranoia and horror with Asia having constant encounters with the villian but then it changes to a more calm and healing feel and then switches back to fear before the last scenes fall into place.The only things that really bothered me was Asia has a cop, she didn't quite bring in the feel that she was one. And this film has alot of similar elements to Argento's earlier film Tenebre. Either way I highly suggest this film to fans of psychologic thrillers but this is not a good film to experience Dario Argento for the first time if you have yet to witness any of his great early work.",

    "review/text": "Asia Argento is a cop on the trail of a rapist/serial killer who she follows from Rome to Florence. Once in Florence she falls victim to the Stendhal Syndrome, a supposedly real psychological condition(it's described in detail on the second disc) that causes people to feel ill, become disoriented, hallucinate, faint or lose touch with reality when exposed to certain pieces of artwork or architecture. While this condition may indeed exist, I doubt anybody experiences it to quite the degree Asia does in this film, as she is able to literally(in her mind) step into a painting and immerse herself in the environment the painting depicts. These scenes showcase Dario's flair for visuals. So, it's bad enough that she's got this Stendhal stuff to deal with, but at the same time, the killer has targeted her. Like the killer in Argento's Opera, he becomes smitten with Asia, and isn't so much interested in killing her as he is taking her for his own perversions whenever he feels like it. This sets off a series of events that leads Asia through a nightmarish adventure. To give away more of the plot is to give away some of the twists. This movie is kinda split amongst the Argento fanbase, with some on one side saying he'd lost his way and others saying it's one of the most underrated and misunderstood movies of his career. Of course you'll have to see it for yourself to be the judge of where you stand. Personally, I found it very enjoyable and disturbing. Only two things really bugged me about it and they're not too big. First off, the movie does drag a bit near the halfway mark more than it should. Second, it's hard to build alot of sympathy for Asia's character because she's such an emotional basket case from the very beginning. The whole film has her going through many psychological changes, freaking out, crying and doing irrational stuff at any given moment. I realize that this is all part of the overall point, but we never see her \"normal\" to begin with, so it's kinda hard to identify with her on any level at all. That's not to say Asia's performance is bad coz she actually plays it quite well(of course she's pretty much made a career out of playing women with psychological baggage of varying degrees). Very well, actually. A very interesting film any way you cut it, and a must for Argento fans. This dvd from Blue Underground looks wonderful compared to that cruddy Troma disc we've had to suffer through for the last few years. Disc 2 consists of various individual interviews totaling a little over an hour and a half with Dario and other crew members. One interview is with the psychologist who Dario consulted about the Stendhal Syndrome. This is the doctor who apparently is the world's authority on the syndrome and treats many patients at a hospital in Florence. She also wrote the book on the subject. This is an interesting little feature. Supposedly 80% of the population suffers from this syndrome to some degree. BS or not? You decide. Good movie though.",

It also didn't feel like it was a FULL letterbox version as parts of the opening credits were cut off on the left and right edges.One of the interviews was OK, but it was really an interview all about Argento's 'Phantom of the Opera'. The other interviews were extremely cheesy as they weren't even done in person -- it was just Dario holding a microphone answering questions that were coming to him over the phone.The movie is quite interesting and better than I expected. It deserves a much better DVD than this extremely cheesy production from Troma, though. Movie gets a 4/5, DVD gets a 1/5.",

    "review/text": "Argento peaked with \"Susperia\", but this film is still worth looking at, even if it's only for the first half.One major question is why Argento kept casting his daughter in his later films? Maybe he thinks she is a brilliant actress. Maybe he enjoys filming her in the shower and being raped. Maybe (and this is my personal theory) he doesn't have to pay her as much. Whatever the reason, Asia is unconvincing in this role, and had a stronger actress been cast, the film might have held together better.Asia is Anna, a police officer from Rome. Right off the bat there's a problem with this. Since it's unlikely Roman police academies recruit out of middle schools, Asia is way, way to young for this role. But, bless her heart, she does give the part her all and creates a likable, sympathetic character out of Anna. Anna is in Florence following up on a lead in a serial rapist case. While in the Uffuzi Gallery she is overcome with intense sensations and hallucinations known as Stendhal Syndrome, and Asia does do a good job in getting us to believe she is disoriented and amnesiatic for a time. She's then brutally raped by her quarry, returns to Rome for counseling, and then kidnapped and raped again by the monster Alfredo. Here is where Argento had a chance to really give the plot some meat, since Alfredo has fallen in a perverse sort of love with Anna, and exploring their relationship would have been interesting.So....Anna escapes and we think it's the end, right? Uh, no. The movie proceeds to drag on while Anna starts wearing a blonde wig, dates a cute French research assistant and believes herself to be pursued by the presumed dead Alfredo. By the time we get to the pretty good finale, the movie has lost so much momentum that it's hard to work up any suspense anymore.Still, there are some wonderful trademark Argento shots and angles that are worth watching. Otherwise, the story was too complex for Argento and so it falls flat. Asia tried to make a strong character out of Anna but she was too young and too inexperienced at the time to do so. Alfredo was played wonderfully and while he's on-screen is very scary. This film had so much potential.",

    "review/summary": "Difficult and contradictory but occasionally fascinating",
    "review/text": "The Stendhal Syndrome is probably Dario Argento's most difficult and contradictory film. On one side it's a nasty little thriller about a serial rapist and killer with some unpleasant violence (albeit not as excessive as you might expect). And yet at the same time it does make a genuine effort to build a narrative around the psychological after-effects on one of his victims as she continually reinvents herself in an attempt to run away from the experience. Unfortunately, the fact that she's played by Asia Argento, an actress with more ferocity than subtlety doesn't help. Nor does the fact that the Stendhal Syndrome itself, a form of emotional overload and physical breakdown in the presence of great works of art somewhat similar to the Jerusalem Syndrome, isn't really explored. The bad cgi when it is doesn't help either. Still, it's much, much better than the likes of Argento's pitiful Phantom of the Opera or The Card Player, but it's not essential viewing by a long, long way.The film has always had a checkered history on DVD - for all Lloyd Kaufman's boasts of releasing the uncut version, Troma's release was less than impressive and 74 seconds shorter than the Italian version (a couple of brief dialogue scenes trimmed by Argento himself) with a underwhelming transfer that offered only the English dub. The extras were a mixed bag too - three interviews with Dario Argento (one about Phantom of the Opera), a TV spot, stills gallery, interview with fx man Sergio Stivaletti and, for no discernible reason, Ruggero Deodato on Cannibal Holocaust and far too much Troma crap. Whereas the Italian PAL 2-disc DVD offered the dubbed American version and the very slightly longer subtitled Italian version on separate discs but was overcropped to 1.78:1 rather than the original 1.66:1 widescreen, Blue Underground offers the uncut film on the first disc with optional English or Italian soundtracks in 1.66:1 (the film reverts to subtitled Italian for the restored scenes) in a superb transfer supervised by cinematographer Giuseppe Rotuno that finally shows the film in it's true colors after years of grainy and washed-out transfers. There's also a good selection of substantial interviews on the second disc. Although the making of documentary on the Italian two-disc set hasn't been included, with separate interviews with Argento, special effects supervisor Sergio Stivaletti, assistant director Luigi Cozzi and production designer Massimo Antonello Geleng, there's no cause for complaint. Best of all is the fascinating interview with psychological consultant Graziella Magherini, who originally identified the syndrome in the unrelated non-fiction book that inspired the film.",

    "review/text": "This flick is not my favorite argento movie but that being said it's still a good movie. This is more of a psychological thriller and that may not please some argento fans who want a straight forward giallo or murder mystery. Asia argento is a excellent actress and she carries this movie as well. The blu ray edition is a better edition than the standard one however the blu ray process really brings out the grainy style of filming. The \"evil dead 2\" also is this grainy and it leads to a sparkle like effect that is only slightly distracting in some scenes. Perhaps on future blu ray releases the producers can tone down the grain if a movie utilized it as a technique in filming. Personally I have never been a fan of grainy filming it's not artistic it's just grainy. But the picture is crystal clear and the movie has never looked better so it's a proud addition to my horror collection. If you enjoy murder mysteries with a psycholical theme you may enjoy this movie but if you want a straight forward murder mystery you might be more happy with 'the bird with the crystal plumage\" blu ray instead.",

    "review/text": "On watching the first half of this film you'd be forgiven for thinking it's one of those grisly 'rape n' murder' horrors we get all the time nowadays - except for the occasional dream sequence thrown in (sometimes done well but there is some pointless cgi here)I was shocked by some of the films content as I'm more used to his earlier work (daft slashers with great art direction) and hadn't seen anything by Argento post-'terror at the opera'. However, It was worth sitting throughWhat struck me the most was how moving I found the second half of this film. You really care for the characters - even the seemingly insignificant support characters - and at the films climax (although totally predictable) I actually weeped like a little girlThat could just be me thoughBut seriously, Argento has actually gone up in my estimation - There are some truly original moments and themes explored that you wont get in any other genre horror movie - this is a surreal psycological thriller more than anything. Perhaps not as enjoyable as Suspira, Tenebrae or Profondo Rosso - but definitly worth a look if you want to see a different side to Argento's work",

    "review/text": "It still astonishes me how often this film seems to get slated. From the first time I saw it, I have always rated it among Argento's best. A popular train of current thought seems to welcome Nohosonno as return to form since his last major triumph, OPERA. Apart from the fact that I think these two films are often overrated (they are still great films), this does a grave injustice to Stendhal. But then again, I also quite like Phantom of the Opera, must be the Asia factor! (rightly acknowledged by most as one of Argento's weaker efforts; however, given his pedigree, this is not as bad as it would for most).The Troma release is unusual in that the voluminous extras tend to clash with the main feature. You can easily ignore these if they are not to your taste. I bought the special edition of Smow White (largely due to the Suspiria connection), and have still to watch any of the 7 hours (or whatever) of bonus materials.The picture quality does seem quite washed out, but having not seen the French DVD or any projected version, I don't know how much of this is directorial intent. It fits quite nicely to the atmosphere of the film / Morricone's music.I hope this film earns greater recognition as the years progress. It may also come to be seen to as the prologue to the new trinity of giallo that Argento is working on. His new film, I seem to remember reading somewhere, also involves Asia playing a policewoman.",

    "review/text": "Make no mistake, this really is a cruel film, and more emotionally involving than usually is the case with a Dario Argento film. It is &quot;giallo&quot; in style, however the plot points more to a psychological study, both of victim and of the psycho himself. Almost universally panned on it's release, it's a film that grows on you from each viewing. There are quite a few rapescenes in here that are truly harrowing, and they are to be commended for showing how degrading and brutal a rape can be. Also on the bonus side are some ravishing scenes from the Uffici-gallery, a nice (though not top) Morriconescore and an interesting character study from Kretschmann as the psycho. Asias performance is more of a mixed bag. Gritty and determined, yet vulnerable and on the verge of a nervous breakdown, she is sometimes impressive. However, she seldom convinces entirely, especially at being masculin. Other minuspoints are also: slow middlesection (the therapy sessions really go on forever), some embarrassing performances (could be the dubbing) and a few akward plot-turns.

    "review/summary": "Excellent Latter Day Argento Film",
    "review/text": "While not the roller coaster of non-stop virtuoso bravura camera work, wierd lighting, and non-stop murders as many of the films Argento made his name on, The Stendhal Syndrome is nevertheless a very fine latter day film by Italian horror/suspense maestro Argento.The focus here is on Anna, a police detective with Rome's anti-rape police unit, very well played by the director's daughter Asia Argento. Anna suffers from the title syndrome, which causes those afflicted to literally lose themselves in works of art. This leaves Anna vulnerable to the very serial killer/rapist she is working to help catch.Mr. Argento pulls absolutely no punches in depicting the absolute horror of Anna's rape, and while the film's unflinching cruelty may be hard for some people to watch, it is totally appropriate to the subject matter--the fact that Dario Argento takes the issue of rape so seriously in this film for me rules out any accusations of bad taste.The focus is very much on the character of Anna, of how both the Stendhal Syndrome she suffers from and the experience of being raped and stalked affect her character, and Asia Argento is a fascinating presence to watch in the role.Mr. Argento employs his considerable cinematic skill well in this film, not overwhelming the story and character issues with excessive stylistic flourishes, but nevertheless employing, with more restraint than usual, some very stunning and brilliant camera work and scene staging in the depiction of the both the experience of Anna's losing of herself in great works of art, and in conveying the terror of her situation. Many breathtaking Italian works of art are featured in the film, and the Italian locations are well used too.If Anna were simply to turn out to be a passive victim, though, there would not be much of a story, but to reveal all that happens would be to spoil the experience of watching this film for yourself.Ennio Morricone did a fine job with the music score for the film, and the quality of Troma's VHS tape, while not quite up to the standards of Anchor Bay, is of surprisingly good quality. There were a few places near the middle of the film where the image flickered a bit for a short time, but aside from this brief distraction, the picture and sound quality are excellent. While probably not quite the full original 1.66:1 aspect ratio, this VHS version is nevertheless moderately letterboxed, so there obviously can't be much of the picture not on screen here. This version, by the way, the $14.98 retail version, is the superior quality SP speed version--beware the inferior quality EP version sold elsewhere on Amazon for $9.98.",

Although there is some slight graininess and very minor artifacting during the film, the image actually looks really Nice, especially considering Troma put it out. I was very relieved it looks as good as it does. The film itself is better on a second viewing and, although it's not amongst Argento's best, it is definitely a superior thriller by the italian maestro. The excellent Ennio Morricone score is also a major plus. And Asia is quite effective as the young woman subject to the hallucinatory nightmarish condition brought on by works of art. A psycho rapist with a razor-blade smile is killing women in Italy and Asia's art-visions lead her into his clutches. Yes, this is the film where Argento filmed his own daughter's rape scene. Extras on the disc include two interviews with Dario (the Lloyd Kaufman one and another on the set of &quot;Phantom&quot; which is a lot more interesting) not to mention some &quot;hidden&quot; interview footage of Argento in Stockholm (accessed by hitting the &quot;9&quot; to get the razor blade). There's also an interview with Sergio Stivaletti and for some reason, there's an interview with Ruggero Deodato who discusses &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; (don't really know why it's on this disc) The interview with Deodato has really bad translated subtitles....he talks and talks, but the subtitles are really basic and abbreviated. Better than nothing, I suppose. The film &quot;bios&quot; on Dario and Asia are simply filmographies (it amusingly lists &quot;Four Patches on Grey Velvet&quot; instead of &quot;Flies&quot;! ). The disc also contains all that superfluous Troma stuff (games - trivia - Troma tours- etc.). All in all, a great disc for Argento fans!",

She does go after a serial killer that goes around raping and murdering people, Anna must know more of the killer's instincts and moves if her Stendhal Syndrome doesn't get in the way.Very artsy and gory psychological horror fantasy thriller from Italy's greatest horror master Dario Argento offers surreal imagery, gory violence especially the realistic razorblade to the lip sequence that will make you cringe, and a creepy score by Ennio Morricone. Dario's daughter Asia is truly gorgeous in this picture as the detective, the film does have scares and good focus on characterizations. It's a very original and stunning horror-feast for fans of the genre and Italian horror movies, it's totally one of Argento's best movies.This 2-Disc DVD contains quality picture and sound plus the uncut uncensored version of the film with both English language and Italian language with English subtitles.

    "review/text": "I've seen this movie only once, and only a couple of days ago, but details are becoming vaguer and vaguer in my mind. This is never a good sign. It was watchable, definitely, and it generated a very strong, surreal atmosphere throughout the first half, but it fails to go anywhere terribly interesting, and gets increasingly dull as the film goes along. It's still worth seeing if you're a fan of Dario Argento, but if you aren't there are a helluva lot of others films you need to see first.The film stars Asia Argento as a detective on the track of a serial rapist/murderer, who becomes the victim said criminal shortly after she is succumbs to the Stendhal Syndrome.(i.e. a strong physical reaction to a piece of art. Fainting is the symptom in her case) There's not much of a plot-arc here, as after the setup it is just sort of a portrait of her life, as she takes a turn for the nutty after her experience, and is again victimized by the still at-large killer. Much of the early film is quite compelling, as Asia lives in a world somewhere between reality in fantasy, where she walks in and out of paintings, accompanied by Ennio Morricone's repetitive and haunting score. However, the more surreal aspects of the film are de-emphasized in the latter portions, and are, sadly, not replaced by increased plot development or action. And, even the effective earlier portions tends to be less effective than his Dario's best work. My problem with the second half is probably heightened by the fact that I stumbled across what happens at the end of the film before actually viewing it. However, this is true of most of the Argento films I've seen, and none of the others have faultered in the latter portions to nearly the same extent. Beyond this, the hints as to the conclusion of the film are so incredibly blatant that I suspect most viewers will have no difficulty figuring it out long before the ending, though I certainly couldn't say for certain.(I'm also perhaps a bit influenced some of the reviews I've read before hand, which said that it started pretty strong but got boring by the second half. But I kinda doubt this effected me too much. There just isn't anything of interest going on in most of the second half of the film.)Many people have talked about how disturbing the rape-scenes in this film are. Personally I'm not affected by them much. I guess this is because rape is, presumably, most disturbing and painful from a psychological standpoint, and I just can't connect that way. But, lots of people are disturbed by them, so consider yourself warned. This is a different sort of thriller than most of Argento's most famous work, so there is less of an emphasis on the horror set-piece. What this comes down to is that there aren't any really effective horror or violence related scenes in the film. Most horribly, they use some absolutely hideous computer animation for some gore and other visual effects. If you can't afford decent CGI, don't use it, for God's sake!The acting is a mixed bag, as usual. Asia is acceptable, if not amazing, other than in the scenes where she is supposed to be 'tough' which she can't pull of at all. The rapist is pretty good too, very creepy while still seeming more or less human. No one else in the film is worthy of particular mention.As many have said, the DVD does look rather crappy, though it isn't quite as bad as I'd imagined considering just how maligned it is.(It's not far off, however) Still, if you're expecting something like the various Anchor Bay releases of Dario Argento's films your gonna be in for a nasty surprise.Definitely subpar, but with enough effective aspects to make it worth checking out, it you're into this sort of stuff.",

    "review/text": "THE STENDHAL SYNDROME[La Sindrome di Stendhal](Italy - 1995)Aspect ratio: 1.66:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby DigitalQuite unlike anything Dario Argento has directed before, THE STENDHAL SYNDROME is a grimly realistic portrait of a female police officer (Asia Argento, essentially miscast) whose encounters with a sadistic rapist/serial killer (Thomas Kretschmann) have devastating consequences. Though distinguished by some truly horrific violence, played straight by Argento with few of his trademark stylistic flourishes, the film is much too languid for its own good, wasting a lot of valuable time on an otherwise laudable attempt to depict the long-term consequences of a vicious sexual assault on the central character. Furthermore, the harsh subject matter allows no room for levity, and the austere scenario is at odds with the sumptuous artwork that acts as a catalyst for the murderous proceedings. Asia's convulsive reactions to works of art (hence the ornate title) makes her a target for Kretschmann's psychopathic killer, allowing Argento to fill the screen with paintings, sculptures and beautiful objet d'art, which offsets the film's own lack of visual flair.But there's a fierce intelligence underpinning the somewhat predictable scenario: When Asia de-emphasizes her femininity in response to the initial attack, only to re-establish her womanhood after a second assault in which she emerges the victor (or does she?), it becomes easier to forgive the painfully obvious surprises which clog up the final quarter. Only one scene recalls the best of Argento's work: A potential victim being stalked through a dimly lit room full of oversized marble statues, a brilliantly edited sequence which suggests everything and reveals nothing. Overall, \"Stendhal\" may not be vintage Argento, but it's too clever and too unsettling to be easily dismissed, and it gets under the skin like no other horror film in recent memory. See it and make up your own mind.",

    "review/text": "This movie is definately one of Argento's best. As usual the movie features Argento's masterful camerawork and artistic set design. The movie also features enough scares to satisfy any horror fan. Where this movie truly shines, however, is in it's pschological aspects. It is unberable at times to watch the tortures which Argento puts his daughter Asia through. After an intense first half, the movie shifts it's tone radically. Unbelieveably it becomes more disturbing. If not for a few cheesy cgi effects this would be a perfect movie. Still, if you can sit through it and keep your eyes on the screen, it would be hard to find a more rewarding film experience. Buy this movie today.",

    "review/text": "This certainly isn't one of Dario's classics, but the presence of Dario's daughter Asia in the central role, certainly raises the quality and interest of the film. She is a solid actor and good fun to watch on screen. Admittedly the plot is somewhat loose in parts, but this is typical of the Dario Argento style, and this movie certainly has the hallmarks of one of his films. There is a fair degree of blood and guts but nothing too torturous to get worked up about. I'd say it's about on par with most of his other efforts in this regard and perhaps a little less confronting. As others have mentioned the quality of the film on this DVD is quite poor. It looks very much like it was filmed on video rather than real film. The colours are washed out and the image is grainy rather than sharp. This is somewhat of an Achilles heel because Dario's movies draw much of their power from their vivid often somewhat surrealistic imagery. When you are watching a diminished copy like this, you just don't notice the cinematography. Hopefully, as others have said, a better copy is still to be released.",

The film alone would rate at least 4 (out of 5 stars) but the Troma DVD is pretty appalling. The audio is hissy and the volume low and the picture is incorrectly letterboxed and riddled with digital artifacts. If the DVD weren't bad enough it's made even worse by having a horrible, embarrassing introduction and foolish, faux interviews with Troma president Lloyd Kaufman. A good film is severely cheapened by a poor presentation. A big, fat ZERO for the disc. Hopefully, Blue Undergroud or Anchor Bay or Mondo Macabro will be able to obtain the rights soon and do this film justice.",

    "review/text": "When it came to the 90s a lot of horror filmmakers who had their rise to fame in the 70s and 80s were for some reason unable to make the transition into the 90s. In general most filmmakers don't get better with age they get worse. Of course there are always exceptions. I believe Dario Argento was one of the exceptions, well sort of. I think the 90s started off well for him, Trauma was a much underrated movie in my opinion. While you can see he was starting to lose it just a bit, he still made a solid movie.The Stendhal Syndrome continues that; it's a movie by a director who reached greatness and is still hanging on to that. This is one of those movies that really stands-out in Argento's career; for starters The Stendhal Syndrome is a lot darker than his previous movies. It has more in common with a 70s exploitation flick than it does what Argento is known for. Like I said The Stendhal Syndrome is a lot darker than Argento's past movies and even at times feels a lot more real. Dario Argento was a filmmaker who really knew how to create a sense of dread and doom and while it doesn't always work here for the most part it has that feel through out.The Stendhal Syndrome as I stated really does stand-out; at times it's almost like a different filmmaker and that is actually a very good thing. Argento strays from his formula of past movies and makes a very solid and in my opinion a much underrated movie in his brilliant career. While he does stray in parts there are also flashes of what made Dario Argento one of the most Iconic horror filmmakers of all time. The Stendhal Syndrome is labeled a Giallo and while it does have those elements it strays from the typical conventions of what a Giallo is.The screenplay by Dario Argento was overall rather solid. A lot of people tend to forget that he is actually a good writer. If you go back and view his early work such as The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Deep Red they were very well written and while the only weakness in Argento as a filmmaker could possibly be seen as a writer he did manage to write some solid scripts. But really starting with Suspiria his scripts did start to lack. That isn't to say they were badly written, but they often lacked logic and it was Dario Argento the director that made those movies he did starting with Suspiria such brilliant horror movies.Unlike some of his past movies, The Stendhal Syndrome is very character driven. While there are some murder scenes and some being very graphic the movie relies more on character moments rather than action and I think it was done rather well. Argento sort of took elements from his past movies, but mixed them up. By this time in his career I think that had to be done. He could have played it safe and done the typical Giallo, but I think that would have hurt the movie and suffered from the, been there, done that. In most Giallos it's about the murders and the investigation. But here in The Stendhal Syndrome the murders and investigation take a backseat and the primary focus is on Anna Manni played by Asia Argento.Again even though I do think early in his career Argento was an excellent writer and than became a good writer his movies weren't really known for their characters. While he did create some interesting characters over his career when talking about his movies the characters often come last. But The Stendhal Syndrome is one movie where you'll probably mention the character of Anna Manni first.On the visual side you know what to expect, while it's not Suspiria or Inferno, the movie still looks quite good from a visual side, but Argento seemed to tone down his normal style, which in this case I believe was a good thing. Argento just might be the best visual director to ever grace the silver screen. But in a movie like this I think Argento's visual style could possibly take away, so it was a wise move to downplay it. But there are many great visual moments; it's a Dario Argento film, but visually the movie is good, but it wasn't a movie to show off his visual style.Don't go into The Stendhal Syndrome expecting the typical Argento movie; like I said this is quite different. There are a couple of murders, but they aren't the main star of the movie and actually there can be long stretches without one. The Stendhal Syndrome does move slowly in some areas, but I don't think it ever gets boring. I always say there is more to filmmaking than just story-telling. This is hard to explain without making Argento sound bad, but in general his movies weren't about story-telling at least as his career went on. But this time around he goes back to that and tells a story of Anna Manni who goes through some pretty horrific events and goes through this mental breakdown. It's all handled quite well and very believable.Any fan of Italian horror knows that often enough the movies can sometimes be incoherent or slightly incoherent. Sometimes something will happen without an explanation or a plot twist that doesn't really seem to make a whole lot of sense. In the case of Argento, his movies can often be seen as a nightmare and I suppose it makes sense when things don't make sense. But The Stendhal Syndrome is very coherent and is as much a drama as it is a horror movie. The Stendhal Syndrome proves again Dario Argento can not only write, but tell a story.The cast is pretty good led by Asia Argento. Most complaints is she looks to young to be a detective, while I guess that is true, I loved Asia in this movie and the way her character transforms from the first half of the movie to what she becomes in the 2nd half was believable and she does an excellent job at playing both. I just adore Asia Argento and despite some complaints I thought she was simply amazing. Thomas Kretschmann is pretty good as Alfredo Grossi the villain, but the movie wasn't really about him. I would have liked to have seen him have a little more screen time, but he does well in his role, which is quite pivotal to Asia's character. Marco Leonardi as Marco Longhi also delivers a good performance. All the cast members were pretty good actually and is probably one of the better acted movies done by Argento.I also enjoyed how the movie changes in the 2nd half. It's sort of like 2 movies for the price of 1. The 2nd half the movie changes focus, but it doesn't feel out of place it actually works quite well. A lot of times when a movie changes focus in the 2nd half it barley works, but to Argento's credit he is able to mix it up and make everything work and work very well. The first half and the 2nd half both fit together, but the focus does change a bit.In closing, The Stendhal Syndrome isn't a perfect movie there are some elements that come across as slightly silly, but as a whole the movie works very well and in my opinion this movie is much underrated by Argento fans. It was a slight change of pace and works well. After this though things would mostly go downhill for Dario Argento, but The Stendhal Syndrome, while not the best work in his career can stand proud next to his brilliant body of work.Interestingly enough, 2004's The Card Player was originally meant to be a sequel, but when Asia Argento wasn't available it became its own movie. The lead character in The Card Player is named Anna Mari rather than Manni. Not sure how it would have worked, but interesting.",

    "review/text": "CONTAINS ONE MINOR SPOILERThe Stendhal Syndrome was the second movie I saw by Dario Argento. Since then I've become a huge fan of his work. Many people find this multi-layered thriller to be one of his failures and I find that hard to believe. Granted, it's more character driven than most of his movies tend to be and the movie's pace and athmosphere change dramatically in the second half. Still, I found out that it's got a lot of his trademarks (having now viewed all his movies except Four flies on grey velvet, which I can't find anywhere). It's stylish as hell, with great use of artworks (as metaphors that is; the scene where Asia covers herself in paint had me wondering), the music score is excellent (by Ennio Morricone; not Goblin) and the violence is at times extreme (the rape scenes particularly, since you know Asia's father is directing them).The real difference with this film considering Dario's other films is the psychological undertone. I have watched this movie now three times and I'm always seeing something I didn't figure out the last time. That's what great complex thrillers do, they always keep you wondering. This is without a doubt Dario Argento's most complex film, it demands the audience pay attention to what's happening. As far as psychological thrillers go, this one ranks high.",

    "review/text": "Despite an incredible opening 20 minutes, THE STENDHAL SYNDROMEsoon meanders into tedium and never manages to recover. Although initially disappointing Argento titles such as TRAUMA, for example, have blossomed with the passage of time, this film seems particularly resistant to reappraisal. Certain elements work extremely well, with Thomas Kretschman's forceful performance, Morricone's repetitive score and Asia Argento's hypnotic visit to the Uffizi Gallery being the major assets. Unfortunately, the film soon abandons it's one truly original idea - the \"Stendhal Syndrome\" itself - and heads in a more mundane killer vs. police direction. Of course, Argento tries to spice this up with abherrent psychology, grotesque sadism and narrative trickery, but the end result never approaches the high standard set by classics such DEEP RED or TENEBRAE. Scenes between Anna (Asia) and the police psychiatrist are interminably boring, whilst the less said about the unconvincing family relationships and romantic scenes, the better. Although this is my least favourite Argento film, it certainly didn't deserve the humiliation of being released by Troma! Lloyd Kaufmann's inane, ill-informed introduction claims the DVD contains the digitally re-mastered director's cut. What this actually means is a BADLY transferred version of the TRUNCATED export print. Compared to the luminous image quality of the French DVD, the Troma disc's muddy, washed out colours are extremely unimpressive. The largely irrelevant extras and promos for idiotic junk only add to the bargain basement atmosphere. If you're an Argento completist, wait for a more definitive release - shelling out for this contemptible mess from Troma would be murder.",

    "review/text": "Assistant Inspector Anna Manni is sent from Rome to Florence on an assignment to capture a serial rapist who has raped 15 women and killed the last two. While at the Uffizi Gallery, the paintings have a weird effect on her, she feels herself being immersed in one of them, and collapses. However, the rapist assaults her, then rapes and kills another woman in front of her. The incident leaves Anna traumatized, with feelings of self-despite, insecurity, and pent-up aggression.The kindly psychologist assigned to her describes the title condition to her in describing what Stendhal (the pen-name of psychological novelist Marie-Henri Beyle) felt at an art musuem: \"My feeling is so profound that is borders on pity. All this speaks clearly to my soul. Oh, if only I could forget it.\" Symptoms also include a cold sweat, nausea, anxiety, hallucinations, severe depression, and personality changes.She returns to her home in Viterbo to recuperate from her ordeal, but the rapist tracks her down and assaults her once again. Anna deals with him in a very brutal scene, but hey, he deserved it. But has he really been defeated? And will Anna become her old self?The Stendhal Syndrome is different from Argento's usual fare in that there are no eerie glaring backwash of red, blue, or green, or horror gore. And leave it to Dario Argento to subject his own daughter to some really nasty ordeals, even if it is only acted out. Asia's pretty in a more natural way instead of the artificial movie bimbos are. She's more a dazed, insecure victim here, but she can be tough. Argento's method of exploring human psychology and concepts (be they architecture or alchemy in Inferno, insects in Phenomena, or witchcraft in Suspiria) carry on in this movie--here, he explores the power that art can have on people. No, Goblin or Keith Emerson do not do the music here, but there's an ongoing haunting theme, with a female vocalist singing the notes. Not on the same level as his classic stuff, but still worth it.",

As is fairly well known country blues got its start down in the South during the early part of the 20th century (if not earlier) as a way for blacks (mainly) to cope with the dreaded, deadly work on the plantations (picking that hard to pick cotton). In this volume (and in a couple of other previously reviewed volumes in this series ) Stefan Grossman, the renowned guitar teacher and performer in his own right has taken old film clips and segments from early television and produced an hour of classic performances by the masters of country blues guitar picking and singing.From the start this is a treat for those interested in finger-picking styles and to witness the legends of this particular pantheon. It starts with a good old Kentucky boy, Merle Travis, doing his mountain version of the classic traditional, \"John Henry\", and works through the likes of Mance Liscomb, Doc and Merle Watson and the Reverend Gary Davis,the last who should be familiar to those who watched the previous DVDs. No finger-picking film could pretend to be complete without a bow to the genius of Elizabeth Cotten (of the folk super-classic \"Freight Train\" fame). The documentary conceptually finishes up with Josh White doing his version of \"John Henry\" to demonstrate some common sources of both black and white acoustic country music. Well done.",

The guy is good...We can not expect to see Dennis Chambers, Weckl or other drumming gods at this festival every time. But I beleive that a drummer performing for Modern Drummer Festival must at least be inspiring or different if not excellent or top-notch... In that sense, performances by Nick D'Virgilio, Shawn Pelton & House Of Diablo, Airto Moreira and Matt Wilson were uninteresting, and I would have preferred to watch something else instead..",

    "review/summary": "Superb Documentary on the Band that brought us Clapton, Beck and Page!",
    "review/text": "This DVD on the HiQ label is a quirky release. It's a UK produced DVD distributed by Voiceprint - which has been releasing the Tony Palmer films in the US this year. The DVD feature is a reissue of a 1992 Documentary on the Yardbirds produced by Delilah productions for Atlantic Records and released on VHS in 1993 by Warner Strategic Marketing (It still has the copyright notice at the end). The 53-minute film features new interviews (at the time it was produced) with all the then living members. Vocalist and harmonica player Keith Reif died in the 1970s. The story of the short span of five years that the band was together is laid out with interviews combined with rare archival footage of performances in the US (Hullabaloo), French and Belgian TV and the BBC. There are many full numbers (though I wish they had indexed these as separate chapters for repeated viewing). The interviews are insightful, particularly the comments from Jeff Beck.There is also a \"Bonus Feature\" which consists of a FABULOUS performance of four numbers from the German TV show \"Beat Beat Beat\" from 1967, with a seven-minute version of \"I'm A Man\" that's worth the price of the DVD alone. (There are more \"Beat Beat Beat\" shows coming early next year from HiQ and I, for one, am excited to see these. The crisp print and great camera close-ups are perfect.The DVD comes with a booklet of, supposedly, liner note but most of the 20-page booklet is devoted to an essay and liner notes for a new Yardbirds album \"Birdland\" recorded in 2003v with new members. These notes have nothing at all to do with the story here.I would give this DVD five stars for what's on the disc - but dropped a star because of this strange packaging, which makes no sense.Steve Ramm\"Anything Phonographic\"",

    "review/text": "As one reviewer suggested this might be a bootleg as it's not listed on the official Yardbirds website.Nonetheless this is worth every penny if only for the excellent quality of live music and TV show footage.There are plenty of band interviews with all of the living Yardbirds including some Clapton, lots of Beck and Page and Peter Grant even gets some camera time. There is one band interview in particular from sometime in the 90's and Beck is straightforward hilarious with his behind the scenes stories and critiques of things like Blow Up.This is very well put together, tells the story and is entertaining.If it is a bootleg or something done without the band's consent then whoever made this should be in big trouble right now.I have Googled for Yardbirds lawsuits against HiQ and could find nothing.People want to see this stuff, especially things about short lived, ground breaking, inventive and elusive bands (Hello Joy Division!).If the Yardbirds or any band that cares about it's \"legacy\" wants make sure the history of their existence gets the correct treatment they should beat all others to the punch and do it themselves (Hello XTC!).Take the Beatles example and claim your history and stop your sobbing (Hello Kinks!)Eventually someone cobbles together a video history of these bands, if not for the love of the music then for money, either way it will get done and we the adoring public will eat it up.Surely people who have been in this business as long as the Yardbirds know that.I'll give it 5 stars just to annoy the \"guy who knows the band\" and that I really do enjoy it and will watch it repeatedly. Hey lighten up, it's only Rock and Roll!Great stuff,Love it, Buy it now!",

Lots of classic, though incomplete, live footage is included and almost all the original participants weigh in with facts and anecdotes. The video is well-edited and easy to watch. Not for fans only this piece is recommended to all rock/pop music lovers but probably essential for true Yardbirds fans.Additionally, this edition includes four complete live performances from the final incarnation of the Yardbirds - Jimmy Page, Chris Dreja, Keith Relf, and Jim McCarty - which is also sold separately.

Great interview segments though, and the video footage is definitely rare and precious for fans of the Yardbirds, Clapton, Beck and Page. My only real gripe is that the running time is only HALF of what it claims (1 hr. 45 min.). After the show is over, it just repeats itself! What a dirty trick...of course, it's no big deal since the video is so cheap. I would have bought it even if they had listed the running time accurately as 52 minutes. Maybe it's just an honest error, but they should fix that so that there are no unpleasant surprises.",

I found Jeff Beck's interviews to be the most interesting because they were extremely frank and uncensored.Many of the performances on this DVD are frustratingly incomplete. SOME of the Video Quality is really poor. The clips from US television are all lip sync, unexciting and disappointing. The more complete genuinely live perfomances from NME Poll Winner concert and the Richmond (UK) Blues Festival with Jeff Beck are very rewarding. The sound quality is not great as can only be expected due to their age and crude recording techniques.The late Keith Relf comes off better than I expected. His showmanship was well highlighted in the DVD.The Bonus Track from German TV 1967 (Beat,Beat,Beat) with Jimmy Page is a real MONSTER. The audio recording is clean and undistorted. The Black and White Video is clean also. The engineers on this recording did an excellent job for the times. The camera work is good. You can really see Jimmy Page working hard. All the songs on the Bonus Track are among the very best of The Yardbirds repertoire. There is an extended version of I'm a Man as it was performed live when I saw The Yardbirds in 1968. Keith Relf puts on a good show here as well. You won't be disappointed by the Bonus Track, which is worth the price of the DVD itself.",

It just seems rushed...and Usher just seems to be more than a little bored. It could just be the way it was recorded, I'm not sure. He's doing his thing though, and the dancers and musicians are certainly on point. Usher didn't seem to relate to the audience too much this time out. Maybe it was editing, I'm not sure, but for me it's an important part of any show. You want the audience to at least believe you're having a good time doing what you're doing!... I don't think the London show was a good show to record. The crowd seemed a bit tame to me. Stateside would have been much better I believe... The entrance was hott! U really don't get to see how really good this is until you look at the DVD extras! It's great. The song selection, staging, dancing, and costumes are all excellent as well. It was well worth the $11.99 I paid for it(I thought that was cheap!). I own a lot of concert DVDs. This one ranks somewhere in the middle. So go out and get, it's great!",

I've seen enough of this tour on YouTube to know he did a hot steamy number to \"Trading Places\" which was not included on the DVD. Bummer. Also being a huge fan and not familiar with the song \"Monster\" which the DVD opened with was a little off putting. The dancers were fabulous as was the set and Usher himself. The crowd seemed a little subdude to me and perhaps that is why Usher didn't seem as into it or as playful as usual. He also kept it pretty clean, for which I was a little disappointed. We all know Usher can move his hips and it wasn't enough thrusting for me, lol. Despite of these little things, I enjoyed the DVD and would recommend it.",

This particular video I designed for the seniors who are beginning to enter the world of fitness or for those who already love to workout but are looking for something different. As always a protion of the video is put towards saftey tips and health tips geared for seniors. The actual workout has three different levels. The first is set at a level where either you have never worked out or for health reasons you need a non impact workout. The second level is of course set at a non-impact to light impact level and the last is medium to high impact. Now when I say high that is based on the age groups of 55-65, so don't let that word scare you. This workout is an interval workout. This means the heart rate will be raised and lowered through out the workout. There is also weight training and balance movements. These are KEY elements as our bodies get older, we need to keep the joints moving and the bones strong and healty. The nice thing about my videos is that as you improve you simply go to the next level within the video! I hope you enjoy this video workout and as always feel free to E-Mail me with your comments and what you would like to see in the upcoming videos. Best of Health and happiness! Mechelle A Smith",

    "review/summary": "Aspects Of Realism Taught By Impressionistic Exercises",
    "review/text": "The two DVD set \"Life Drawing Techniques In Action\" by Bridget Woods demonstrates short drawing exercises (typically 5 to 20 minutes) that gently introduce students to aspects of realistic drawing and the traditional art studio environment. The drawings are impressionistic, but the lessons about realistic drawing are driven home.The drawing of the female nude shown on the front cover of the DVD case is done in one exercise, but it is not a typical drawing. (Calling the other drawings \"impressionistic\" may not be the precise term from the point of view of art history, but if publishers of non-fiction media can use misleading packaging, reviewers must also be given some slack. The other drawings are \"sketchy\", \"gestural\" - you get the idea. Furthermore, the drawing on the front cover is done in chalk and Conte crayon while most other exercises on the DVD are done in charcoal. ) Currently you can find video excerpts on the Crowood Press website that show typical drawings or your could try using a magnifying glass on the back of the DVD case.The exercises involve sketching nude models. Footage includes shots of the models taken from the artist's point of view, so a student might use stop-motion to try the exercises for himself. Although Nudity is present in almost every exercise, it not an essential element of the course. There is no detailed discussion of anatomy and no technical anatomical terms are used. There is no instruction about drawing the muscles of the body or hand or feet etc. It seems to me that instructors could teach this material using models that wore light colored tights Sometimes Bridget Woods remarks that she is using the belly button or a nipple is a landmark. Perhaps a teacher could indicate anatomical landmarks on a clothed model with tape.Bridget Woods speaks with a British accent. Her presentation is clear and organized. It's polished enough to be from a script, but natural enough that it might be spontaneous. It's the ideal type of narration. The video shows her drawings, the model, and sometimes a projection of the image of the model on the drawing.These DVDs are an excellent introduction to the traditional studio environment. Many prospective art students are comfortable sitting at a desk, drawing on copier paper or on the back of store receipts with a pencil, and consulting a photograph for their subject. Although they feel that they \"know how to draw\", their enrollment in a studio class is disorienting. Instead of the desk, there is the vertical easel. Instead of a PostIt note, there is a huge sheet of drawing paper. The familiar pencil is gone and replaced by a burnt stick of wood. They must try a new way of holding it. The person to be drawn is all the way across the room. (Whether that person happens to be nude or not isn't the major novelty in the situation.)The lessons on these DVDs give students a comfortable introduction, one that is simple, but not \"too easy\" or insubstantial. The DVDs are only an introduction. They don't take students to the level of detailed figure drawings.Reserved and analytical people might be slightly uncomfortable at some moments in the course since Bridget Woods tries to communicate that drawing should be an enjoyable experience, like a mild form of dancing. Such people are used to being slightly uncomfortable in social situations, so they can take it.I rate this DVD set as five stars out of five to indicate that it is superior introduction to the studio environment and the methods of realistic drawing.SynopsisDisk OneRhythim and CurveUse the \"muscle memory\" in your arm to draw curves implied by the model. This is a practical way to solve the problem of locating your drawing so the entire pose fits on your paper.Measuring And Angle FindingThis is a practical demonstration of how to measure distances and angles with a pencil. There are valuable practical hints such as: Don't measure first. Draw first and then check by measuring. Stand back from your drawing when you check measurements on it. The most outstanding feature of how this material is taught is that we see Bridget Woods doing measurements in many of the subsequent exercises. She does not make elaborate measurements. She emphasis is that a drawing should begin by getting the big things correct. Even though a drawing is sketchy, some proportions of the figure should be checked.Negative ShapesDraw the outline of a reclining model lying on a rectangular mat in a severely foreshortened pose by using the \"negative shapes\" formed by the models body and the edges of the mat.Zig-zaggingDraw sweeping curves between important points on the pose of the model.Eye TrustPlace one hand on the edge of the paper and draw the model with the other hand without looking at your drawing. Notice how you get an idea of the location of the drawing hand from your placement of the non-drawing hand.Passionate LineA demonstration of the varieties of line that can be drawn. Draw the model using lines that express different parts of the pose - as opposed to using lines that indicate outlines.Disk TwoTone: a trip around the modelA discussion of \"tone\", i.e. lightness and darkness. She gives valuable hints about how the mind tends to misjudge tone. For example, the eye tends to interpret a highlight within a dark area as being as bright as a highlight in a lighter area, even if it isn't.Mid tonesShade the areas of the model that are less than 50% lit. All these areas are to be drawn in roughly the same shade.Find the FormPut a roughly uniform coat of charcoal on the paper and then lift off areas to show the places on the model that are more brightly lit.Black and white on mediumSketch the model using white chalk and dark Conte Crayon on gray paper. Begin by drawing a a series of light to dark squares on the edge of the paper that is used as a reference for the values in the drawing.",

I particularly liked the way Ms Woods demonstrated each technique on paper rather than describing it, all the time showing the model, and at times even superimposing her drawing over the model to make a point. I found many of her 'lessons' helpful and would think many Amazon clients would agree. Incidentally, her book that piqued my interest wasLife Drawing: A Journey to Self-Expression",

    "review/text": "Underneath that red divot in the failed TV pilot THE HANGED MAN is Steve Forrest. Also here in a small role is Robert Mitchum's kid brother, John.This film's curious premise is that an atheistic gunman somehow survives the gallows and in a reborn fit of cosmic do-goodery he roams the west looking to help folks in distress. His first (and it seems only) beneficiaries are a widow and child who are actively harrassed by an unscrupulous land baron (aren't they all, though?).Forrest is alleged to have psychic powers but they're too intermittent to be relied upon. Bad guy Cameron Mitchell chews scenery, screen time and everything else save horseshoe nails and cactus needles. Sharon Acker as the \"woe is me\" female lead acquits herself as well as possible in such a dumb story as this. It's no wonder that the only place this proposed TV series went was on a warehouse back shelf. In fact, when it was placed there all the other bad pilots moved over.NOTE:Gray market discs such as this offer no commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features. Dubs are \"best available source\" and can vary from very good to only fair.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb user poll rating.(5.5) The Hanged Man (TV-1974) - Steve Forrest/Dean Jagger/Will Geer/Sharon Acker/Cameron Mitchell/John Mitchum/Hank Worden",

    "review/summary": "Well intentioned but heavy handed melodrama",
    "review/text": "I knew nothing about this film and when it started I was instantly drawn in by the strange but moving presence of the young European man working in an orphanage in India. We soon learn that a benefactor in Denmark, where, it turns out, the young man. Jacob, is from, has offered a huge sum of money to the orphanage and Jacob goes back to Denmark to get it. It's the first time he's set foot in Denmark in twenty years and he is somewhat hostile to the whole scene, but is doing it for the money. The older man, Jurgen, is an extremely successful, self made man, very Type A, who expansively invites Jacob to the wedding of his daughter, Anna, which is being held that weekend. Jacob doesn't seem like a party guy but, having nothing else to do, and really wanting that grant, he shows up at the wedding.Here's where the plot thickens. There are strange looks passing between Jurgen's wife, Helene and Jacob and soon we realize that Anna might just be the product of an affair between Helene and Jacob back in India. It's a very interesting set up and I was really eager to see where the plot would lead us. I think that, in the hands of a better director it might have been very good. As it was, it was terribly melodramatic, really over the top performances in some parts, which made the characters lose any credibility. The actors tried valiantly and there were some parts that I found genuinely moving, but much of the second half of the film was tacky.I found the Danish countryside nice to see, especially the well appointed house of Jurgen and the interesting countryclub where the wedding party was held. There sure were a lot of stuffed animal heads on the walls, though, and the occasional close ups of these beasts was supposed to symbolized something important, I guess, but to me they just looked creepy. Likewise, the many close ups of peoples' eyes. It was an attempt to be arty that really failed and further cheapened what could have been a much better film. It seemed that the director was trying to imitate Ingmar Bergman.I think that if the director had cut about a half hour of the excessive emoting, that a fine film exploring some complex human relationships might have emerged. It seems like it was a good idea that got carried away with itself, and like so many opera plots, death just seemed like the only way to wind it up. Too bad.",

I haven't seen many Danish films so it was interesting to me on a cultural level. The scenery wasn't a huge part of the film, but it showed some lovely aspects of Copenhagen. I did enjoy the film and would suggest it to people wanting a thoughtful film somewhat in the vein ofThe Descendants.",

    "review/text": "This is really a woman's film in the sense there is a lot of dissection and discussion back and forth about what people feel about situations from each and different angles. ( Frequent camera panning on the eyes alone) Jacob the newly discovered genetic father with paternal commitments in an Indian orphanage. The newly discovered daughter who moons over him despite 18yrs of happy bonding with a surrogate father of her own. Jacob who moons over her. Helen's the mother torn because the father shouldn't have told the daughter.. I don't have the time for these type of lost genetic re-unions as the catharsis strikes me as nothing more than self indulgent projection and wishful thinking. There is enough evidence that children deeply consider the parent/s they grew up with the real ones and the genetic one no more than a curiosity. Even the daughter switches back sides leaving Jacob looking like an anomalyThat said this an appealing film for people attracted by domestic/family dramas. Its well made scripted and acted and doesn't degenerate into soap opera.However Mads Mickkelsen sticks out like a very sore thumb as mis-cast in this film. There is no chemistry or likely compatability with the mother ever. He's a washed up loner who is reached by orphans. A lost soul who becomes a found soul if a lost orphan needs him. Once again I cant see he ever had a mutual attraction with Helene the staid pretty domestic goddess / mother in the film. Or the inherant emotional empathy to instantly bond with a girl-stranger despite a genetic dart.The plot re-casts him into an executive role which somehow cheers up the mis-casting but this role was made for a more daily looking guy who becomes transformed into superman by the executive role thrust upon him.Mythic in Valhalla Rising. Mean and dark in Casino Royale or Flame and Citroen. Its not a matter of being brainwashed by having him seen him cast in other roles. He is a distraction to this charming then moving drama because he looks like a wolf in sheep's clothing. Or something from Red Riding Hood. \" Grand-ma what big TEETH you have! !!!!!!!!!\".........",

I loved the clash of cultures depicted where Jacob ran an orphanage in India but had to travel to Denmark. In Denmark, he visited a billionaire's family on their estate which looked like a place where titled countrymen would live. This was a business trip to apply for a large donation to Jacob's orphanage. He gets a lot more than he bargained for when he is invited to attend the billionaire's daughter's wedding. I love a movie that grips me from start to finish, and that is what happened here. There is a wealth of emotion, suspense and beauty from the Danish location. I wasn't expecting such a rich experience when I happened upon this film. It makes me want to forgo the mainstream Hollywood theatrical films and further explore indie films. When I used IFC as a search criteria there were quite a few Prime eligible Instant Amazon Videos. I am looking forward to the journey that these unique films take me on.",

I like the contrast between Denmark and India -- very effective -- but I'm a bit of an India lover, and more India would've given us more contrast.",

    "review/summary": "Typical Susanne Bier",
    "review/text": "The infamous Danish director Susanne Bier has established herself as the so-called queen of piercing relationship melodramas (bordering on soap-operas), filmed in a style reminiscent of Dogme (natural lights, handheld DV cameras), only with a script and a soundtrack. Her \"Open Hearts\" dealt with the consequences of physical paralysis, and what that does to a blossoming relationship. \"Brothers\" told a story of two, um, brothers, one of them back from torn Afghanistan, competing for the affection of a beautiful woman (Connie Nielsen).Bier's poignancy, the immediacy that carry her films, and the truthful dialogue that resonates have, so far, overshadowed her over-reliance on close-ups of the protagonists' eyes, insistent sentimentality, and a pessimistic tone that can frankly be a major downer. Bier's US feature debut, \"Things We Lost in the Fire\", got criticized for an overexuberance of those latter qualities. Though \"After the Wedding\" is a stark and powerful drama, it also suffers from an unremittingly dismal tone. It seems as if Bier, instead of infusing her films with a much-needed sense of humor and love for life, has delved even deeper into the sadness and wretchedness that people can inflict upon each other.Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) works in an orphanage in India. It faces closure due to financial issues, so he goes back to Danemark to ask for a grant from multi-millionaire Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard). Jorgen immediately begins to play mind games with Jacob, telling him he will \"consider\" him as one of the main contenders for the million-dollar grant, but needs a few days to think it over. Since Jacob has nothing to do, Jorgen invites him to his daughter's wedding. Jacob arrives, suspecting nothing. And then he recognizes Jorgen's wife...From this point on, the film goes into plot complications that I will not divulge. I will say one thing - it's all downhill. As lies are unmasked, and old secrets surface, things only get worse.Granted, \"After the Wedding\" is a class act. It's assured, mature filmmaking, with a clear sense of purpose. The acting is beautiful throughout - it really is hard to pinpoint a stand-out, everyone's so good - as is the script, the film's deliberately slowly unfolding plot gradually revealing its many mysteries. But the film is also claustrophobically depressing, with barely any humor relief from all the drama. There's even a clumsily added (seemingly last-minute) sub-plot involving the daughter and her new husband's infidelity, which seems wholly unnecessary, apart from adding even more weight to an already weighty drama.As for the film's Dogme-like style, its pretentiousness distracts from the plot in some crucial spots as much as it entices you to watch in others. I'm a big fan of Dogme films, but here, after the 100th aforementioned lingering close-up of someone's eyes, artistry is toying with self-parody, and that's not a good thing for a film in which the inter-weaving of style has to be seamless.So, while better written, directed and acted than the majority of Hollywood dramas, \"After the Wedding\" will not appeal to those who try to avoid depression-trip movies. In typical Bier fashion, it raises a lot of questions of love, death, the choices that we make and their consequences, and only provides answers to some, while leaving the rest for our deliberation. Maybe it's time for the director to attempt a new approach; she can remain an auteur but try a different genre, for example. As it is, \"After the Wedding\" is competent: powerful but unoriginal.And depressing. Boy, is it depressing.",

    "review/text": "One can see why this movie garnered such praises. Beautifully filmed, knockout kids, excellent performances, and a glorious soundtrack brilliantly featuring Sigur Ros, the film looks, sounds, and feels spectacular. But it is thematically where it lost me, and lost me bad.I suppose we are to see contrasts between rich and poor, past and present. Money cannot buy everything. Yeah, OK, think we've heard that one before. But what this film is about is atonement. And it seems to say that money can indeed buy that. Jorgen wants to fund an orphanage to atone for his unnamed sins (unless the mere act of making money is a sin in itself.) 12 million dollars, even if they are depressed, buys a lot of hope for a lot of kids. Jorgen, apparently a truly and consistently good man in the world's eyes, is satisfied to do so. And garners praises. Jacob, sullied by a vile past, seeks atonement by serving the world's poor and desperate. Different path, same solution: works.But I don't think it is so easy. This is atonement for the non-religious, or karma-crowd. The good makes up for and outweighs the bad. Poof, all nasty stuff gone! Do a lot of bad, you had better do even more good to balance the scale. In a Denmark where the Protestant religion once flourished, but here plays no role other than officiating at weddings and funerals, this is the only moral scale to be found. But the old one, the one that says deeds cannot ameliorate what was done, seems far more true to me. Having characters scramble to fix their sins with actions, earning their way into (whatever--public acclaim, easy conscience, family respect, heaven...makes no difference) is the post-modern solution. And one that would make all the very rich, very-ugly-past Hollywood types jump for joy. \"See! I can undo all the scuzz I did and illegitimate children I fathered!\" I'll choose forgiveness instead.",

A soapy drama based on these tight social 'taking care of' themes. The ending is supposed to look somewhat happy but feels dismal. The king of manipulation has played everyone. No one shines in this in fact everyone is equally suppressed. Natural look to the lighting(just mentioning). I suppose the nastiness of the financial element in combination with a family plot makes for a very medieval story. Think marriage to maintain political security between territories. Overly tight social guilt and weak personalities make the film grim. Different category from something like American Beauty which springs to mind similar in the introversion & obsessive motives and somewhat dislikable personalities of the characters. Where American Beauty shines with art however After the Wedding feels artless. They both are depressing but somehow this one is simply mean spirited.",

    "review/text": "This is a powerful movie. It starts out slowly, mainly focusing on a man, Jacob, whom for the first half of the movie I did not like. He was too self-focused and abrasive. As the movie starts, Jacob is working in an orphanage in India, but is called to Norway by a multi-millionaire, Jorgen, who says he will donate money to the orphanage. When Jacob meets with Jorgen, Jorgen procrastinates and says he is still considering and invites Jacob to attend his daughter's wedding the next day. At the wedding Jacob meets Jorgan's wife, whom he recognizes as someone he knew many years ago. And thus the story begins.This movie is superbly directed by Susanne Bier, who has directed several highly noted movies centering on how families behave during crisis situations, like \"Brothers\", about interactions between two brothers when one is sent to the war in Afghanistan, and \"In a Better World\" that won the 2011 Academy Award for best foreign film.After the wedding is subtle in some ways, obvious in others; but it will demand your attention and engage your emotions the whole way. I don't know if it will have you squirming in your seat, as one reviewer says, but he is correct when he says you will be unsettled. The movie has strongly affecting visceral elements and I found myself thinking about different segments days later. The movie was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2007, but lost out to \"The Lives of Others\", another outstanding film.",

He is tapped by countless international productions for his incredible skill and unique overall persona/image. He is an actor who carries his weight on screen. He is this man he portrays. His actions and movement on screen are incredible. He acts without words.Rolf Lassgrd (Swedish Wallander Movies) blew me away with his portrayal of Jrgen Lennart Hannson, a Swede tycoon in Denmark. For me, I love the Swedish actor, speaking Swedish against one of its two sister languages Danish. It is something enjoyable to me for reasons I cannot explain here. This role was far from what I have seen him portray. He nailed it.Sidse Babett Knudsen also threw down in this work of art. Stine Fischer Christensen proved that she is a young actress worthy of her European acclaim. Stine steals our hearts and the later part of the film with a tear jerker scene.Susanne Bier is a master artist. I understand why Hollywood called on her for \"Things We Lost in the Fire\", a film which has her touch, on a smaller scale. I felt that Halle Berry was the weak link as an actor. Also Fire was missing something.I was not happy with a development later in the film. The development makes the story tick.

So as much as Jacob dislikes the idea, and at this point we know not why, he returns to Denmark in Susanne Bier's remarkable, emotionally charged, sometimes even overwrought \"After the Wedding.\"Bier has composed this film in much the same way as a Verismo opera: scenes of confrontation, scenes of enlightenment, scenes of disclosure are piled one on top of the other as the film slithers insinuatingly towards its tragic yet redemptive denouement.All of the main characters: Jacob, Jorgen, Jorgen's wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen in a mature, sexy performance) and Helene and Jorgen's daughter, Anna (Stine Fischer Christiansen: young, fresh, committed) are transformed, turned around and pointed in another direction psychically and physically by film's end due to the catastrophic upheavals that they endure during the course of this amazing film. Bier is dealing with Melodrama here, with a capital \"M.\" Melodrama done up right: not as a joke but as serious and humane as the Master's of this genre: Almodovar and Douglas Sirk (\"Written on the Wind\") to name a couple.Mikkelsen's Jacob, due in a large part to Mikkelsen's hang-dog, stoic physical appearance, is an empty vessel at the beginning of this film. His work at the refuge is fulfilling and good yet you can't help feeling that Jacob is hiding from life rather than contributing to it and that his reluctance to venture back home to Denmark is his way of primarily keeping his past at arm's length. By the end, Jacob is transformed, filled up, overflowing by way of the redemptive powers of confession and acceptance: he's been opened, upended, turned inside out.Don't come to Bier's world of \"After the Wedding\" expecting to be lulled into anything resembling a calm, quiet mood...you will genuinely be unsettled. Do come to \"After the Wedding,\" in many ways similar to \"The Celebration,\" expecting to squirm in your seat, to have your guts wrenched with the terrific bravura acting of this ensemble of actors, to cry your eyes out at scenes of transcendental beauty and truth. This film will challenge you not to react and therefore in one way or another you will react due in large part to Bier's compassionate mise en scene. A mise en scene rife with humanity and love.",

    "review/text": "`After the Wedding,' Denmark's \"Best Foreign Picture\" nominee for the Academy Awards has a lot going for it. Even if there is a soap opera feel to the scenes and the story, the quality is head and shoulders above any serial. Not to mention the fact we get six months of development in one movie. Solid performances, and camera shots that capture every revealing reaction give the story a magnetic interest.The film begins in India where Jacob Pedersen (Mads Mikkelson) works with the impoverished. He feels at home with the children, but he goes back to Denmark to raise funds for the orphanage and get reacquainted with his family. At home his former love Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) has married a tycoon, Jorgen Hanson (Rolf Lassgard), someone Jacob is able to solicit funding with ease. Once they meet, he is invited to their daughter's wedding. Much like `Rumor Has It' with far less laughs, yet more substantive development, Jacob finds out at the reception that he has more at stake at home than he previously thought. From there he is reattached to deceptive Helene, and both must sort out the bitter resentment they feel for one another. (Did he have one affair as he says or was he the philanderer by her account?) Toasting her mother and step-father at the wedding, the bride Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen) later comes to grip with life-changing information in her own life.Skillfully sorting out the relationships and priorities of the key players, `After the Wedding,' presents a bitter-sweet story with memorable characters and interesting circumstances. One of the merits of the film is how it defines poverty in India and compares it with a different kind of impoverishment for the wealthy. Jorgan's problems wouldn`t make us trade places with him for the world. Similarly, one of the boys at the orphanage reminds Jacob that he doesn't even like the wealthy. Another ironically says, \"If I were rich, I'd be happy.\" Watching everyone come to grips with their lives and barter for stability make `After the Wedding` a revealing family portrait.",

    "review/text": "Early on in Susanne Bier's Oscar Nominated (Best Foreign Film 2006) film \"After The Wedding\", Danish expat-in-India Jacob (the solid Mads Mikkelsen) is faced with the prospect of reluctantly returning to his homeland after twenty years to meet with a mysterious man who is offering the necessary funding to keep his school/orphanage open. When explaining to Pramod (his adopted son-of-sorts) that he must leave, the precocious eight year old asks about the wealth of people in Denmark and finally concludes, \"If I was rich, I'd be happy.\"Soon after, when we delve deeply into the lives of the proposed benefactor and his family, we see that this proclamation certainly does not apply to all people. Or, at the very least, it definitely does not apply to billionaire Jorgen (the authoritative Rolf Lassgard) or his family.Although it seems like it might at first. The jump from the teeming Indian squalor to the lush green Danish countryside almost jarringly illustrates the contrast of cultures (and that contrast is definitely underscored by patriarch Jorgen blasting \"It's Raining Men\" in his SUV); the disparity between the Third World and the First World is indeed extreme (the difference is Two Worlds, by the way - I did the math). It's quite comical to see Jacob, upon arrival, trying to adjust to the cushy confines of the hotel where Jorgen houses him, as he can't figure out how to work the electronic amenities.When Jacob finally meets with Jorgen, his pitch is given short shrift by the busy billionaire: \"We're through,\" Jorgen says impatiently, leaving Jacob's presentation video mostly unseen. But he still leaves the donational door a bit ajar as he invites him to his daughter's wedding, where Jacob could get some more face time. This seems like a good plan at first, as Jacob has nothing else to do while in town, but revelations at the ensuing reception reveal that all is not as it seems. Indeed, when newly-betrothed bride Anna (played by perky Stine Fischer Christensen) rises to make an unconventional speech and says, \"Mom's waiting for something to go horribly wrong,\" well it turns out that Mom (aka Helene) (Sidse Babett Knudsen, in a deeply-layered performance) doesn't have to wait long, and all of their lives are soon turned upside-down.As an unabashed fan of Scandinavian cinema, I had high expectations for this film, and it didn't disappoint in most respects. The crisp, naturalistic cinematography and unapologetic (although occasionally a bit melodramatic) exploration of emotions is all to be expected. Also always welcome are the sardonic, dry lines of humor and the quirky characters (such as online gambler Grandma, who - according to Helene - is senile \"only when she wants to be\" and is mostly seen complaining about her laptop's wireless internet reception).A couple of aspects of this film didn't quite work for me, however. First, I found the multitude (maybe between 20-30 close-ups) of shots of single eyes was a bit overdone and took me out of the narrative flow, without having enough of a symbolic upside. Also, some of the scenes teetered just at the edge of being a bit too maudlin and soap-operatic, but I guess life sometimes does get that way, and the actors are never unconvincing.Finally, some of the tonal shifts were a bit too uneven in places, as the film careens from joy to sorrow in split-seconds that can be unnerving in such an otherwise slowly-paced film. But about that pacing: others may complain that this film could have been a bit cut to a more streamlined length, but I personally love the lingering and the loitering that takes place in movies like this - I feel we get to know as much about the characters during their \"down time\" as we would when there's \"something happening.\"Ultimately, I feel this film ends up being an evocative exploration of whether or not to to tell the truth, of when to tell the truth, and of how to tell the truth even when it's difficult. And telling the truth when it's difficult is something this movie is very good at doing. Four stars.(p.s. I'm purposely not telling you who says this review's title quote because I don't want to spoil it for you.)",

    "review/text": "AFTER THE WEDDING (EFTER BRYLLUPPET) (A+)I was just coming off my euphoric high from \"The Lives of Others,\" a Cold War era story of self-discovery and redemption in the desperately paranoiac last years of the East German Stasi, when along comes an exquisite Danish film about reconnecting lives, second chances, and noble deeds called \"After the Wedding,\" written and directed by Susanne Bier, that all but left me hyperventilating. Both films are as freehanded and frank as they are forgiving while penetrating with astute precision the flawed, enigmatic, but accessible souls that populate their narratives. Both explore the murky issues of power, trust, self-interest, honor, morality, and spirituality. Without sentimentality or the manipulation of our responses, both end on an upbeat, if uncertain note of hopefulness.\"After the Wedding\" is often extraordinary for what is left unsaid -- Bier, with 20-20 vision of her story and its implications, believes in an economy of words and the generous use of camera close-ups to capture nuances in expression, gesture, mannerism, and body language, as her characters have stirring encounters with one another. Of course, that approach takes for granted the keen insights and instincts of her actors and how fully invested they are in their roles. Those assumptions are never in doubt with the cast of \"After the Wedding,\" which is headed by Mads Mikkelsen as Jacob Petersen, a rugged, hands-on humanitarian and, in some cases, surrogate father, who administers a food-aid program for orphaned children in India.The promise of a windfall gift from a wealthy Copenhagen industrialist named Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard) that will underwrite construction of an orphanage takes Jacob back to his native soil for somewhat delicate negotiations. There are terms and conditions to iron out before the transfer of funds can be implemented, so Jacob is obliged to be obliging to his benefactor for a few days. As it happens, the wedding of Jorgen's only daughter Anna coincides with Jacob's stay, and the affable billionaire is graciously adamant that Jacob attend, though our hero is clearly more at home with grit than glitz.Just after the ceremony itself, Jacob encounters a coincidental and shocking link with his past and, later, a stunning revelation about the present, that saddles him with a potentially life-altering dilemma. What follows is an urgent and deeply affecting melodrama, in its most distinguished form, that explores with brilliant clarity and aching humanity the yin and yang of allegiances, moral ambiguities, and, in the end, a decision that tests the mettle of a man torn between two callings.Mikkelsen, seen for the first time by most American moviegoers as the villain Le Chiffre in last year's James Bond prequel, \"Casino Royale,\" is a magnetic actor, in the mold of Clive Owen, Gerard Butler, Christian Bale, and Russell Crowe, who commands the screen with his ideally constructed frame, chiseled cheekbones, and wide eyes that peer icily and inscrutably, probe menacingly, and well up tenderheartedly as befits a complex character haunted by a less-than-impeccable past and confronted with having to make intelligent judgments and agonizing choices that will change the entire landscape of his future.But \"After the Wedding\" is almost as much Lassgard's film, as he transitions from impregnable corporate mogul with appearances of ulterior magnanimity to gentle giant in the ultimate state of vulnerability. He has a scene near the end of \"After the Wedding\" that's as exhaustively heart-rending as any I've seen on film.Like \"The Lives of Others,\" \"After the Wedding\" was an entry in last year's Oscar sweepstakes for Best Foreign Language Film, but wasn't placed in general U.S. release until the first quarter of 2007. They'll be tough competition for the wave of late year entries that usually dominate my \"Dazzling Dozen.\"",

As money for the orphanage is dwindling, the benefactor appears offering financial help. But like every charity, this one has a catch too. Scenes from having main character Jacob return from Indian subcontinent to Europe show his displacement in the world he originated from. It is obvious that he has been away for too long and everything, from his beautiful, tanned face to the suit he is wearing looks awkward in his new surrounding. It feels as if he almost wishes to leap back to India and his familiar surroundings in orphanage. And from this point on, story starts developing with surprises on every step along the way. Emotional intensity keeps building and building. I have not seen a movie so powerful like this one since \"Barbarian Invasions\". This is a story of redemption, love, forgiveness and new beginings.

The thing is, though, it's simply not the case. Over time, we learn and see that Rolf Lassgrd's Jrgen is anything but a man to leave things to coincidence. The viewer is let in to slowly see his charm, his shrewdness, his business acumen...and the little scheme he's put into play between his family and Jacob, as portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen ('Le Chiffre' to 'Casino Royale' fans).As for Mikkelsen, what can I say? He's Denmark's George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, all rolled into one. The guy can act, too. You'll see the phrase 'soap opera' used on these pages. In the hands of lesser actors, yes. But not with Mikkelsen and Lassgrd - their performances are what landed this film on this year's Oscar nominee list. [As good as it is, no way it was going to win out over 'The Lives of Others' - to me, that's the best single film of the decade so far.]",

He and his group are looking for funding to keep the orphanage afloat. He gets word that a man with influence and money wants to see him before he will give money to the orphanage. Jacob reluctantly returns to Denmark. Here he meets Jergen, played by Rolf Lasagard, who wants to be his benefactor. This man has power, too much money and Jacob is not impressed. It appears that Jergen wants to think about the funding over the weekend, in the meantime, he invites Jacob to his daughter's wedding. This is where the film takes off. At the church Jacob recognizes Jergen's wife, Helena. Helena, played by Sidse Babett Knudsen, is shocked to see Jacob- we understand right away that they had a relationship. During the wedding and reception, we come to also understand that Jacob is probably the father of the bride. This is quite a soap opera. However, this is only the beginning. Jergen has plans, and as the film evolves we see that instead of the ogre, he may have planned something. He is not thhe uncaring man, he seems to be. Jergen has a scene that is masterful and one of the best I have seen.'After The Wedding' shows us what sacrifice is all about. Jacob for his orphans and Jergen for his family. This is a film that shows the difference between classes and the goodness in people. The acting by all is admirable. Afterall, we are told tht charity begins at home.Highly Recommended. prisrob 11-30-11Valhalla Rising[[ASIN:B000JLQQ58 Proof: Season One",

    "review/text": "I truly respect director Susanne Bier for not conforming to the types of films society often embraces but actually really working to create something that feels real and pure within her work. Even in her English speaking film `Things We Lost in the Fire' she never shied away from presenting the audience with something uncomfortable if she knew it was `real'.Of all her work, I feel that `Efter Brylluppet' is her best.We all know the term `misery loves company' and if you've read my reviews long enough to know the types of films I often indulge you'd know that that phrase can be applied to my preferred entertainment choice. I love a film that can move me to tears and tear me down because it produces something real in me; a real emotional connection to the material. Thus, the film becomes something so much more than just `entertainment'; it becomes a part of my soul. `Efter Brylluppet' is not that depressing but it does produce something in me, something raw and unforgettable. The film filters through so many emotions on screen and it elicits so many emotions off screen. It's such a well rounded emotional rollercoaster and I love that about it. You can feel something for every character, but what makes this movie so amazing is that you feel so many different things about each character. There is no designated villain, no designated hero, no designated victim. Everyone is all of the above at one time or another and thus each and every character becomes so much more than just a `character', they become human.The film tells the story of Jacob, a man working in an orphanage in Bombay. When funds run low and he becomes desperate he travels to Copenhagen to meet with a wealthy man offering to `consider' his orphanage for a large donation. The catch is that he must stay and attend the man's daughter's wedding. It turns out that this man, Jorgen, is married to Jacob's ex-girlfriend Helene who happens to have bore her daughter, Anna, out of wedlock. If you aren't following then I'll put it a little blunter.It appears that Jacob may actually be Anna's father.This is the immediate surprise, but it is not the only one, in this masterfully crafted weep fest by Bier. Each character has so much to say, and each and every word seems to help complete and or flesh out the person next to them. Each person is so connected and reliant on those around them.`Efter Brylluppet' exposes the beautiful side of human connection; trust me.The acting here is also outstanding from everyone involved. Mads Mikkelsen is wonderfully controlled as Jacob, allowing his eyes to expose what his character is always trying to conceal. I also really loved what Rolf Lassgard did with the character of Jorgen. He takes this man and creates someone who appears one thing, so mysterious and someone guarded, and exposes his secret in such a desperate and crushingly realistic way. It's a beautiful (and heartbreaking) transformation. As great as the two men are, Sidse Babett Knudsen is even better. As Helene, she really has to carry a lot of the emotional weight of the film (it was her cross to bear) and she does so with such raw connection and flawless control.Such a stunning performance.So, to bring us back to my initial statement, about `misery loving company' and all that. The reason I brought that up is because, as some of you know, I love films that embellish the miseries in life. I often find that a films `happy ending' is a falsity and that it takes away from the gritty realities I like to see in my cinema. What is so beautiful about `Efter Brylluppet' is that I turned my whole opinion on its head. This is a film that, yes, focuses on some of life's miseries, but the end result is something so beautifully complete that it sparked in me a realistic idea of hope. No, the ending is not all roses and candy, but it lessens the bleak with a believable display of picking up, moving on and doing the right thing.",

    "review/summary": "Surprising Revelations Drive a Powerfully Acted Contemporary Danish Melodrama",
    "review/text": "A Danish orphanage worker outside Mumbai, India, is summoned home to receive a large donation from a wealthy industrialist in this intensely acted 2006 drama that seamlessly melds Douglas Sirk's hyperbolic melodramas with Ingmar Bergman's more austere sensibilities. Directed with panache by Susanne Bier, the result is really an involving soap opera given greater texture and surprising plot turns by Anders Thomas Jensen' dexterous screenplay. 2006 was obviously a fertile year for world cinema as this emotionally vibrant film competed against Guillermo del Toro's Gothic fairy talePan's Labyrinthand the winner, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Cold War thrillerThe Lives of Others, for the 2006 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.The story's protagonist is Jacob Peterson, a taciturn man dedicated to the orphanage he runs in India, so much so that coming back to Denmark holds little interest for him other than securing the funding he needs from a multinational corporation headquartered in Copenhagen. The seemingly avuncular CEO Jrgen Hansson just wants to shake Jacob's hand for his humanitarian work. When Jacob arrives, however, it becomes clear that Jrgen hasn't quite made up his mind about the gift much to Jacob's consternation. It seems like a good omen when Jrgen invites Jacob to his daughter Anna's lavish wedding at his palatial home, but then Jacob meets Jrgen's comely wife Helene, who turns out to have known Jacob years before. The story peels off one revelation after another, sometimes with subtlety and other times with the forceful contrivance of a sledgehammer. Each of the major story developments hinges on a secret that a principal character is forced to reveal, most often with devastating consequences.Looking a bit like Viggo Mortenson's recessive brother, Mads Mikkelsen (almost unrecognizable as the nasty banker Le Chiffre inCasino Royale) portrays Jacob with haunting power, though sometimes the character is presented too elliptically for Mikkelsen to flesh out effectively. For instance, we don't get a deep sense of his inner struggle over saving thousands of children in India since he lets his pride stand in the way when it becomes convenient to the plot. Rolf Lassgard manages to capture the bluster and increasing desperation of a man used to having his way but unable to cope with the inevitable. When his character's motivations are slowly revealed, his performance starts to unravel into excess, especially in a no-holds-barred breakdown scene toward the end. As the wife with the complicated past, Sidse Babett Knudsen is genuinely affecting, as is Stine Fischer Christensen as the waif-like daughter caught in the middle.Bier's idiosyncratic filmmaking style can be seen in the unexpected jump cuts and the heavy use of close-ups on the actors' eyes during the most tense and cathartic moments. The 2007 DVD is sparse on extras. Neither a commentary track nor a making-of featurette are included, but there is a reasonably insightful twenty-minute interview with Bier conducted by Danish film critic Morten Piil. Also included are the theatrical trailer and eight deleted scenes which Bier explains to Piil were cut because they either detracted from the main storyline or made a redundant plot point with little additional benefit. Looking at them after seeing the film, I would agree with her assessment. It's a very well crafted piece of work and certainly provides enough dramatic fireworks and moments of true insight to make this worthwhile viewing despite the occasional plot contrivance.",

This sets the stage for a number of surprises.The magnificent cast earns this film its three stars. Their work is so powerful that they elevate even the most contrived circumstances. However, they are really let down by director / co-writer Susanne Bier, who has fashioned a manipulative story that is pure soap opera. She also has an annoying visual style that is most exemplified by lots of close-ups of eyeballs and lips.",

He had that sort of mindset when he is beckoned by one of his wealthiest benefactors, and he must go, despite his young friend's intrepidation. After meeting with the benefactor, he is invited to the man's daughter's wedding. It is here that the plot thickens, for he sees his long lost lover is the wife of the wealthy benefactor. Beyond that, the math puts the daughter to be his.The acting by all players is genuine and believable. Well directed and a very pleasing movie to own or rent.",

    "review/text": "Half an hour into this film I was hooked, wondering what the director would do with what had started out as a remarkable work. At the end I was yawning. After the Wedding starts off tremendously -- a Danish aid worker in India learns he will get the large donation he needs to keep his childrens' home running. The catch is that he has to fly to Denmark to meet the donor, who plays with him, suggesting he needs time to really decide whether to hand over the money. \"I have to go to a wedding this weekend,\" he says. \"Why not come with me?\" The aid worker turns up at the wedding to discover his long-lost former girlfriend there. She's married to the donor and may or may not be the mother to the aid worker's child, one he never knew he had.Here's where we are 30 minutes in. And then it all falls apart spectacularly, dissolving into near gibberish as we're hit with melodrama piled on melodrama and bizarre plot twist following on bizarre plot twist. Sadly, none of it is convincing, and by the end I just wanted it to stop. The aid worker starts off as a cipher, someone we know little about, and that's how he stays all the way through. This movie is a mess.",

The artistic triumph of After The Wedding is the slow revelation of plausibility and motivation where at first there seems to be only implausible coincidence and random behavior.It's a sad movie with scenes of genuine love. If you automatically find sadness just a synonym for depression, you won't like it. Is it a melodrama? Perhaps, but it probes far deeper into the emotional cores of its four main characters than any melodrama I've seen since Bergman.Is it a pleasure to watch? I found it so, chiefly for the riveting performances of the actors, especially Rolf Lassgard as Jorgen, whose actions are pivotal in the lives of the others. The cinematography is also truly skillful; each visual has emotional weight. Mainly, I confess, my pleasure came from watching virtuosic acting and directing for a rare change, rather than from the content of the film.",

    "review/text": "\"After the Wedding\" was nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2007 and is directed by Susanne Bier [whose other credits include Brothers]. The story centers on human relationships, and the tangled webs that connect one individual to another, as well as family ties.Jacob [Mads Mikkelsen, more familiar as the villain from Casino Royale] has devoted his time and many years to establishing humanitarian projects in India. He is told that the orphanage he is working in is running low on funds and is persuaded by the director of the orphanage to return to Denmark to negotiate a possible deal, a large donation from a prominent businessman. When Jacob arrives in Denmark, he meets Jorgen [Rolf Larsson] who seems almost uninterested in the details about the orphanage and doesn't give an immediate answer as to whether he will bail out the orphanage. Jorgen then insists that Jacob attend Jorgen's daughter's wedding, and Jacob reluctantly agrees.At the wedding, Jacob is stunned to discover that Jorgen's wife is Helene, a woman from Jacob's past. Soon after this meeting, the drama escalates, as Jacob begins to feel he is some sort of pawn in a game orchestrated by Jorgen. Needless to say, all is not as it seems and Jacob questions Jorgen's motives, as does Helene.There are plenty of twists and turns in this movie, and at times, it does appear contrived, but the excellent acting, especially by the actors playing Jorgen, Jacob and Helene, as well as the assured direction elevates this movie above a regular melodrama. There are some truly poignant moments that had me all weepy, but this is after all a drama about human frailties and the complex ties that bind people to one another.The DVD comes with extra features such as a 2006 interview with the director [in Danish], 8 deleted scenes,and an eight-min featurette that has a movie critic discussing the deleted scenes with the director. Total running time is 1 hr 59 mins, and the language options are:Danish 5.1 Dolby DigitalEnglish SubtitlesSpanish SubtitlesEnglish Captions for the Deaf and Hard of HearingConclusion - excellent Danish drama with substance.",

    "review/text": "****1/2From Denmark comes \"After the Wedding,\" an unusually rich and complex human drama, marked by superb performances, insightful writing, and stylish direction by Susanne Bier. Nominated by the Motion Picture Academy for Best Foreign Language Film of 2006 (but not released commercially in the U.S. until the following year), this is one of the true unheralded movie gems of 2007.Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen) is a dedicated social worker from Denmark whose orphanage in India has caught the eye of a Danish philanthropist named Jergen (Rolf Lassgard), who summons the young man to Copenhagen to discuss his plan for donating a substantial sum of his own money to the project. While in the city, Jacob is invited to attend the wedding of Jergen's adopted daughter, Anna, only to discover when he gets there that Jergen's wife is, in reality, his old girlfriend, Helene, and that Anna might, in fact, be the child he never knew he had.With a screenplay by Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, \"After the Wedding\" transcends the \"soap opera\" nature of its premise to become a deeply moving study of the compromises and sacrifices all of us are forced to make throughout the course of our lives. The characters the writers have come up with are admirably complex, credibly three-dimensional, and never all that easy to peg. With his somber, deeply lined face masking the emotional turmoil within, Mikkelsen gives a darkly brooding performance as a man who finds it easier to give of himself on a grand scale - i.e., trying to save the world - than to make a meaningful connection with any single individual. Sidse Babette Knudson is poised and lovely as Jacob`s deeply conflicted former lover and Jergen`s wife, while Lassgard hits amazing dramatic heights as Jergen, who is, in many ways, the most enigmatic of the three main characters. For much of the film, we are left to ponder whether Jergen is a genuinely good man or merely a world-class manipulator who enjoys playing god with the lives of those around him. Finally, Stine Fischer Christensen delivers a deeply touching performance as the vulnerable young woman whose wedding serves as the catalyst for much of the drama. There are no heroes or villains in this piece, only flawed but well-meaning and believable individuals whom we come to care deeply about throughout the course of the film.In her direction, Bier brings a great deal of texture to the work, focusing on the subtle details of the scenes and boring into the very souls of the characters through intense close-up concentration on the actors' pores and eyes. The music by Johan Soderqvist is subtle and haunting and adds tremendous flavor to the drama.\"After the Wedding\" is a beautiful film that sweeps us up in its story and characters and makes us intimate participants in the world it is showing us. It is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking in roughly equal measure - and what more could one ask of a movie?",

    "review/text": "The accolades accorded to the two leading male actors in this movie are well deserved.What only slowly grew in my consciousness is the outstandingly nuanced performance by the actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, in her role as Jorgen Hansson's wife Helene. I did not immediately recognize the varied dimensions of this finely nuanced performance, a hidden treasure which I only gradually realized through repeated, extended exposure, coupled with my increasing understanding of the underlying psychological dynamics which this actress's film character may have been experiencing, and which this actress's performance sought to convey - which she does with aplomb.Sidse Babett Knudsen's acting is remarkable for another reason: she is playing more than just one role, she is playing three: (tycoon's) wife, mother, and former lover. Each of these roles requires very distinct character acting, each of which this actress plays distinctively, convincingly, and with powerful feminine magnetism.Some of the most compelling and effective acting by Sidse Babette Knudsen, as Helene Hansson, is principally conveyed by this actress's wide range of captivating facial expressions, many of which were so subtle and discreet as to be barely perceptible (see her tete-a-tete with Mads Mikkelsen, conducted over a side table at her manor house) - this caliber and range of acting is terrific stuff.I am not bothered, like some, by numerous close-up shots of the film's four principal characters. Aren't we talking frontal cortex here? I feel these close-up shots are valid and effective, sometime capturing a film character's private, interior moments, and sometimes a film character's behavioral sine qua non - as with the pivotal realization by Jorgen Hansson's wife Helene, to remarks by the grandmother re her son Jorgen's chauffeur, etc. (followed by a close-up shot of a chandelier's dangling glass chimes).Intimate, \"non-invasive\" close-up shots, taken from the side, enable the tender capture of \"getting to know you\" or \"catching up\" moments, when a young girl touchingly examins the facial expressions of her newly-discovered biological father, to see whether he is genuinely interested in viewing the pictures in her childhood photo album.Considering the magnitude and nature of the information which this film's principal characters have to process, and when and in what contexts they have to process it, close-up shots of eyes may be considered to be part of this film's \"action\" - as, in fact, it is.I doubt that this film's type of intimate psychological action could be conveyed effectively to an audience in stage acting, where an audience is relatively distant from actors, as it can be conveyed in a film's intimate, and sometimes mandatory, close-up shots, as we see in this film.It's unfortunate for those of us who do not watch or are not saturated or jaded by soap opera, etc., to be burdened and distracted by some commentators' cheapening, maudlin comparisons of this refreshing, high quality film to, e.g., soap opera.",

But, I came across it in the \"A\" section of the library and picked it up. I was glad I did; otherwise I would have missed out on such a wonderful and beautiful drama. It's not really a love story, it's a commitment to life, love for a family, and on one side, a deep love for children whose only family is the orphanage.The film draws you in slowly, first by its beauty from the happy faces at the orphanage, to the wealthy land and mansion of the super wealthy. The story moves, guides you, takes you on a journey, has you thinking about the plot, and slowly, you are drawn into the reality.With over two hours, it will keep you interested, wondering, deciding, and here see how a great storyline makes you think, accept, respond, only to offer something new to dwell on.Jacob Peterson, manager of an orphanage in India is summoned to Denmark to become a recipient of a monetary reward that will save the orphanage from financial ruin. As he arrives in the midst of a wedding, he discovers that conditions come with the gift.Anna, an old flame is married to the multi-millionaire now, raising a beautiful young daughter who wedding is taking place.This is my first Susanne Bier film, characters were believable; storyline impressive, and the actors have done the characters justice. The film was nominated for numerous awards, including the 2006 Best Foreign Film, but it lost to the German film..The Lives of Others... After the Wedding is a remarkable film. .....Rizzo",

Still, director Susanne Bier has kept the events from being sappy melodrama.Without blabbing away too much of the plot, Jacob (Mads Mikkelson) runs an orphanage in India, in sad financial state, and is given an offer he can't refuse. He goes back to Denmark to meet his benefactor (Rolf Lassgard), and here's where loads of angst and deception develop. Turns out Jacob and the benefactor's wife have history (young, baby-booming hippie lovers, at one time). When invited to their daughter's wedding, realizations happen and all hell breaks loose. Stine Fischer Christensen (as Anna, the daughter) is remarkable, and her mother, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen) is even better, letter-perfect. The benefactor, Jorgen, seems to have the upper hand, but as everything unfolds, true and honest characterizations develop. Can't say much more without giving away essential plot points, but I was riveted and highly entertained. The DVD extras are insightful, especially interviews with the director. The film is beautfully shot, and all the acting is excellent. I also enjoyed Christian Tafdrup, as the groom of the title-wedding. Nothing is ever as it seems, and revelations among the characters keep \"After the Wedding\" always interesting. The surprise Oscar nomination was well-deserved. Too bad it wasn't promoted better in it's American release. Very fine!",

    "review/text": "I'm being spoiled. First I see the beautiful, mature and delightful Mira Nair film \"The Namesake\" (in my top twenty with a bullet) - and now this peach! What's going on!!\"After The Wedding\" has a central performance from Mads Mikkelsen (the facially scared card-playing Le Chiffre in the superb \"Casino Royale\") that is both riveting and Oscar worthy. He's the kind of actor who can just stand there and whole worlds are expressed in his strangely compelling face - an instrument I'm sure the director knew would have us hooked right from the get go. When Mads smiles, you smile, when he hurts - you hurt. When he's on screen, he's riveting, like say Gary Oldman is. And I can imagine, many women wouldn't mind looking at him either - long after the two hours of this is up!This Danish made movie opens with Jakob (Mads Mikkelsen) in an Indian orphanage - where he is distributing food from a truck, giving lessons in English in a shed of a building and generally holding it all together. But as always - lack of funds threathen imminent closure and the destitute children will be evicted out onto the harsh streets. He gets a phonecall from Denmark from Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard playing a millionaire businessman) with an offer of untold millions that will keep his orphanage open and indeed even help others. He seems reluctant to go and get this gift horse, but he has to. Jakob promises the adoring children that he'll be back within a week and he won't let them down. But things change when he gets there.Attending the wedding of Anna (Jorgen's daughter), to his astonishment, Jakob recognises Jorgen's wife - and she him - there's been history. Without giving too much plot away - Jakob makes a staggering and life-changing discovery and also, slowly but surely, begins to understand Jorgen's interest in wanting him back in Denmark.This is about family, loved ones, the preciousness of our kids, betrayal, bad mistakes made in the past, another chance given to redeem them now - all the best stuff - and although some of the performances are at times slightly 'over-the-top' - the movie has heart - and you root for these people all the way to the end.The cast is uniformly excellent - especially Mikkelson and Lassgard - who's rivalry and shared loves are beautifully and realistically handled. There were many scenes where tears willingly plopped out of my weary goggleboxes. And there's superb complimentary music too.I loved this film - I really did. And I hope it will get the vast audience it deserves. Put it high on your rental lists.",

Jacob promises to return in time to one of his charge's, Pramod, birthday. He reluctantly leaves his life in India helping the children, puts on a suit, boards a well-appointed plane and gets a chauffeured ride to a luxury hotel. It's as much of a culture shock as one can imagine.The rich Jrgen's life is one filled with board meetings, a mansion, wealthy friends and relatives, every one of whom could make a difference in the poverty of India. However, there is a wedding to plan, with Jrgen's daughter getting married to a young man of the firm.Several plot twists ensue that make Jacob question the purpose of his life, and which world he wants and needs to live in. It turns out his love and compassion is needed in both.Recommended.",

    "review/text": "\"After the Wedding\" could be the best film I've seen in a decade.And I say that even though I didn't see all of it --- like just about everyone else in that theater, for the entire last half hour I was afflicted by a bout of silent sobbing that wouldn't quit.I cherish that amazing, unforgettable experience: several hundred people weeping together.And then --- I'm not spoiling the movie here --- came a \"happy ending\" that is perhaps the most satisfying conclusion of any film I've seen in a decade.Satisfying because the characters earned it. There was a huge price for each of them to pay, and they stepped up to it. They earned the right to better. And, because you have lived their struggles with them, you leave the movie with the kind of satisfaction that no studio-financed, movie-by-committee-and-focus-group can give you.And the punch line of all this praise?The story is pure soap opera. Really. On a low budget, with no-name actors and maybe even this script, \"After the Wedding\" would be right at home on Lifetime.Consider the plot. Jacob, a Dane in his 30s, works in an orphanage in India. He hasn't been home in 20 years, and that's just fine with him. Bad news: The orphanage is running out of money. Good news: Jrgen, a philanthropist, wants to write the large check that will save it. On one condition: He wants to meet the recipient. The woman who runs the orphanage can't go. Well, Jrgen is Danish, Jacob is Danish. Jacob should go.Reluctantly, Jacob flies to Denmark. Jrgen listens to his pitch for only a few minutes before seeming to lose interest --- it's the weekend of his daughter's wedding. To which Jacob should come. It's not, after all, like he has anything else to do.At the wedding, the first surprise: Helene, Jrgen's wife, was once Jacob's lover. In fact, she was the lover who broke his heart. The lover who sent him scurrying off to India, an orphan hiding among orphans.Other surprises: I'll spare you. And encourage you to read not a word more about the story --- let the twists and turns sear you as they roll out. But I'll go this far: The rich and poor, the white and the colored, Europeans and Indians --- the moral lessons are so easy, aren't they? Or are they? Is Jacob's moral purity really an emblem of superiority? Is Jrgen's privileged life a sign of a rotting soul? You'll judge --- you can't help it --- but when it's over....When it's over, you'll want to thank director Susanne Bier, a Danish filmmaker whose last film, \"Brothers\", is also a memorably wrenching drama. Mads Mikkelsen --- who plays Jacob (and was the villain in \"Casino Royale\") --- will make you forget all other young actors; he's not only shockingly handsome, he can make reticence and distance both intimate and compelling. And Jrgen, played by Rolf Lassgrd --- when the film ends, you'll find yourself replaying his performance to take note of all that you missed. And was there ever a trophy wife as radiant, loving and thoughtful as Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen)?\"After the Wedding\" was Denmark's entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2007 Academy Awards. It lost to the German film, \"The Lives of Others.\" I would have voted differently.There are DVDs you rent from Netflix. You watch them, you send them back; you got the amusement you paid for. But sometimes, very rarely, there are DVDs you buy. You buy them because you think they define a time in your life. Or because you think you'll want to watch them again. Or --- as is the case here --- because you want to press the film on someone you love and say, \"Here. This. A life-changer.\"\"After the Wedding\" took me to places I didn't know I could go to. To places I didn't know I could handle. In fact, I could. My bet is that you can, too.",

I'm so glad it was nominated for an Oscar, although I wonder why a flock of other international nominations did not also occur. Mads Mikkelsen who gained recognition as the villain in the James Bond filmCasino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition), does a good job with a tightly controlled performance as Jacob Peterson. Peterson works in an orphanage in India and then must fly back to his home country of Denmark to seek funds. Mikkelsen's good looks and powerful spats with Helene show him to be an actor with depth and range. Rolf Lassgard's Jorgan is well played with a powerful scene toward the end of the film. Jogan's wife Helene is played by Sidse Babette Knudsen who does an excellent job, making believable the woman in this situation. Christian Tafdrup plays Christian, the groom at the wedding. His good looks make him a good choice; and he shows his colors early on, which rapidly flare into his newlywed estrangement. Stine Fischer Christensen plays Anna, the daughter who must adjust to several paternal adjustments as well as a marital one. Neeral Mulchandani is charming as Pamrod who has been raised by Jacob in India. The film sparkles, constantly moving and developing the story until it reaches its conclusion. We have a sense of where life will go for all of the characters. I found this a breathtaking family drama, well worth seeking. Bravo!",

Anyways, this Danish film was nominated for Best Foreign Picture in 2006 but lost to an equally well-done German film, \"The Lives of Others\". However, I feel that this film deserves credit with its writing/direction and wonderful acting cast. It is a surprise to see Mads Mikkelsen who you probably recognized from the latest James Bond 007 Film, \"Casino Royale\". He actually shines quite nicely in this role.It's difficult to describe the plot without giving too much away. But, I must say that there is a lot of care in slowly revealing the relationship between the main character, Jacob, and the other characters in the wedding. The film presents the happiness, despair, dreams, acheivements, failures, etc. in life which is pretty much like everyone's life in general. We are faced with tough decisions in life and deal with it just like these characters. In the end, we just appreciate what we have and continue living. That's the real charm of this movie which I think that everyone can appreciate from this film. No one is immune to life's obstacles but we learn to deal with it one day at a time.",

However, unless the pace is something that really bothers you, this is a movie that you cannot afford to miss.Jacob is working in India helping homeless children, and in an effort to secure funds for his quest, sees himself forced to travel back home, to Denmark, to meet with the CEO of an important corporation. Upon his arrival, he meets this affable family man, Jorgen, who promptly asks him to stay over the weekend and attend his daughter's wedding. When Jacob sees Jorgen's wife, he realizes that he already knows her, and when a speech by the bride reveals unsettling information, things get complicated really fast. After that, emotions rise to the surface and we witness one of the most beautiful and moving stories I have seen in a long time.This film not only has a wonderful plot as a backbone, but also counts with an astounding cast, all of whom play their roles to perfection, and excellent cinematography. The use of the cameras, especially with close-ups of the eyes when emotional scenes are developing, works perfectly. As if this was not enough, the little I know about Scandinavian culture was proficiently presented. I attended a friend's wedding in Sweden earlier this year and I was amazed at how similar this was to what they showed in the movie. I have always been a fan of Scandinavian productions, but this film is at a higher level than most. Simply brilliant!",

    "review/text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but am frustrated at the poor quality production that went into this DVD -- at least in Canada. I went to buy this a few months ago, but an employee at my local video store told me there was a defect on all copies. The audio is out of synch for the last 2 chapters (Scenes 14 and 15) of the film. I was hoping future copies would be fixed. I just checked my newly purchased copy and he was partially right. The audio is delayed by at least 2 seconds, but luckily only in the 5.1 surround sound setting. The more traditional 2.0 stereo audio setting works fine, and the picture and sound are generally great, but this serious failure of production need not have happened.I'm very disappointed because international and independent films like this get very little attention. Even though this was nominated for an Academy Award for \"Best Foreign Film,\" I doubt it will sell millions of copies in North America. It's obvious that a more popular release would have been given greater respect -- either in the careful attention to its initial production or in quickly issuing a recall to fix the problem. This is a huge insult to fans of non-blockbuster films and especially audiophiles.",

    "review/text": "AFTER THE WEDDING ('Efter brylluppet') is a brilliant work, a two hour synthesis of life that demands our full attention and rewards that attention with some of the finest ensemble acting, directing, dialogue and message that we have come to expect from Danish writer/director Susanne Bier (Anders Thomas Jensen is also credited with the story concept). It is a film that raises difficult questions and situations and somehow pulls us into a world of damaged people about whom we genuinely care.Jacob (a stellar performance by Mads Mikkelsen) is a solitary soul who has found a niche in India as a teacher and caregiver in an orphanage. When he is informed that a wealthy donor is considering being a benefactor, Jacob leaves the children he loves to return to his native Denmark to the home of the potential donor Jrgen (another fine performance by Rolf Lassgrd) and his wife Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen): in Jacob's past he had been lovers with Helene while both were in India). A major event is in the offing - the marriage of 20-year-old Anna - Stine Fischer Christensen - (Jrgen and Helene's daughter) and feisty Christian (Christian Tafdrup). The only character who does not seem to have a secret is Jrgen's mother (Mona Malm) who suffers from mild dementia. It should be a happy occasion, but after the wedding old wounds are uncovered, long secrets are discovered, and nothing is as it seems. Jacob, now confronted with strange realities, longs to return to his Indian orphanage, but Jrgen manipulates his gift of money in a way that uncovers even more secrets. The multiple surprises that occur rapid fire keep the plot and character development spinning until the film closes with such grace that the audience is left stunned.As the current barrage of summer movies assault our senses, making us wonder about the mental hunger for films less than challenging, along comes the release of this magnificent work and reassures us that the era of superb cinema has not dissolved into cartoons. AFTER THE WEDDING is a perfect as a film gets. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, July 07",

    "review/text": "Meeko, Flit and Percy, these the are names of the animal friends who get in and out of mischief, befriend each other and accompany Pocahontas in the vast panorama of pristine North America that is the setting for \"POCAHONTAS.\" No Disney animated film would be complete without these familiar looking creatures and rightly so. These are films for the whole family, but POCAHONTAS was a notch above many of the animated films from Disney over the past two decades.POCAHONTAS was a change-of-pace from the recent trend of animated films from Disney in 1995. This is one of my favorite Disney films and one of the best since the 1960s. It has substance and deals with real issues. We see the Native American Indians at peace and harmony with the land and nature. This is beautifully captured with the exceptional animation of vibrant green forests and flowing blue rivers. These scenes have a breath of fresh air about them that you can almost feel. When the European settlers arrive we know that it is only a matter of time before they begin to erode this paradise. The Europeans with closed minds did not realize how much they had to learn from the Indians and tried to impose their brand of civilization on them. Their brand of civilization is to subjugate or annihilate the \"savages\" and ravage the land.We see the two cultures meet in one of the finest animated scenes ever presented by Disney. Captain John Smith and Pocahontas come face to face by a waterfall. Smith lowers his rifle, as Pocahontas stands erect and unafraid. Their eyes meet and he no longer sees a \"savage\" but a human being. Their eyes tell us that they immediately fall in love. As Pocahontas \"listens with her heart\" as Grandmother Willow has taught her they both communicate with each other. Soon their differences become apparent, but it is John Smith's ignorance revealed by inadvertently referring to Pocahontas as a \"savage\" that is the focus of the rift. He states that there is so much the \"savages\" can learn from the English. Pocahontas asks, \"If the savage one is me, how can there be so much that you don't know?\" During the \"Colors of the Wind\" sequence John Smith learns first hand the value and reverence of nature and that it should not be exploited out of mere human greed.The message of POCAHONTAS is that European settlers leveled forests and imposed their own vision of a \"civilized\" society, whether or not it was welcome by the Native Americans. The corrupt Governor Ratcliffe is shown gleefully using cannons to level forests while his other men wield picks and axes in a mocking musical number. The brown piles of shoveled up earth stand in contrast to the majesty of the green untouched forest. When the settlers open fire on the Indians, they retaliate by capturing John Smith and prepare an execution for him. Only Pocahontas, who can empathize with both sides, can bring them to see their transgressions and teach them that violence only breeds violence.The dramatic structure over which the film's message is delivered deals with her father's disapproval of the man she loves, because he belongs to a different race. The film thus takes on more significance as it deals with ethnic discriminations as well. Her father wants her to marry a member of the tribe, who she dislikes because \"he's so serious.\" A similar theme is taken up in THE LITTLE MERMAID.POCAHONTAS is based on legend, rooted in murky historical events. In real life, Pocahontas was about 13 when she first met John Smith. Smith claimed in his journals that Pocahontas saved his life. John Rolfe was the Englishman that she eventually married. She did indeed get to go to England (See POCAHONTAS II), where she was treated as a princess. She died in Europe, near 21 years of age.What is particularly good about POCAHONTAS is the artistry of the animation. The virgin land of towering green forests, sparkling blue steams and rugged cliffs are drawn with a freedom and energy that posses real power and reverence. Very effective is the jutting rock that overlooks the landscape giving the entire film a feeling of sweep and grandeur. Anyone viewing the finale of this film can not help feel an emotional outburst as the \"colors of the wind\" blow past this precipice toward the horizon. I know I did. The image is unforgettable.The songs by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz include one unrestrained emotionally charged standout, \"Colors of the Wind.\" This is an unforgettable song that can be appreciated on so many levels. It is a consummate example of melody and lyrics that make you \"Listen With Your Heart.\"The Walt Disney POCAHONTAS Deluxe CAV Laser Disc Letterbox Edition 3-disc Set is outstanding for its content and incomparable nostalgia. It is indeed a true artistic product rich in feel and substance. The Special Edition of The Art of Pocahontas Book and the Artist's Portfolio showing the artistic evolution of the character is well worth having in your collection. There are also video extras such as \"The Making of Pocahontas\" and others plus audio commentary that are well done and encompass the entire spectrum of this film's original release. This is a real treasure.",

I'm a fan of the WWE, but I know that the wresters can't act to save thier lives. But I went to see this movie, because I was hoping that it would make me change my mind. But it didn't, there was only one good scene in the movie and that was the very first 5 minutes. John Cena's character in Iraq showed how brave our troops truly are, even though he went in guns ablazing. I love action movies, I love the testaterone pumping flicks like Terminator 2, Predator, and Casino Royale. But this movie didn't get me excited, in fact, it made me laugh. By the end of the movie my sides hurt from laughing so hard. John Cena is about as good of an actor as he is in the ring. His character survives around 6 or 7 massive explosions without a scratch. I don't mind when an action flick has scenes that can't happen in real life, but this was overkill. The only reason I gave this move 2 out of 5 stars instead of 1, was because of it's portrayal of how brave our troops are over in Iraq. When I went to go see it with my friend, he and I were probably the only people without Cena shirts on, so if you're a fan of Cena, then you'll love this movie. I for one can't beleive how crappy of a movie it was. Don't waste your money on this, go buy a copy of Terminator 2, you'll thank me.",

    "review/text": "For the first half hour of this movie the viewer may get the idea that the script Michelle Gallagher and Alan B. McElroy is just awful (with good perception!), but as the film's story evolves the idea that this may just be a National Lampoon parody of action flicks - and if that is the case, it is truly a funny bit of entertainment - for a while. Then it becomes obvious that the minimal storyline (ex-Marine's wife is abducted by diamond thieves and Marine elects to leave his one day 'security job' and take the initiative to capture his wife and strike down the bad guys in the swamps of North Carolina) is really just a matrix for staging as many pyrotechniques explosions as possible. It does get tedious.The 'star' of this noisy, 'Unrated-for-destructive-violence' film is one John Cena, another wrestler from WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) being promoted by the director John Bonito to follow the path of The Rock: the difference is The Rock has done some classy acting and a range of roles that call for much more than flexing whereas Cena seems completely like a fish out of water who has yet to take a class in acting basics. John Cena does have a splendid physique and perhaps that should have been more on camera. Instead his 'John Triton' character, despite his tremendous physical advantages, gets beaten up by some pretty small and older guys, making us wonder why he has all that bulk and no fighting ability.The cast is good to adequate and once you realize this film is a parody, they seem even better delivering the corny lines they are given. Among the crew are Robert Patrick as Rome (the chief bad guy), Kelly Carlson as John's wife, Anthony Ray Parker as the hilarious 'token black' bad guy (he truly has comedic talent), hunkies Manu Bennett and Frank Carlopio for eye candy, Abigail Bianca, Jerome Ehlers, Damon Gibson, and Drew Powell as the crew in flight. They are a likeable bunch of criminals but oh can they blow things up! For the action film addicts only. Grady Harp, February 07",

    "review/text": "Patrick was the only real enjoyable part of this whole movie, and he kept it entertaining, which is the only reason I could think of anyone (who's not a kid or a Cena fan)wanting to see this movie. The movie pretty much portrays Cena in the action film genre as the WWE portrays him as a WWE superstar, invincible, unbeatable, and never get's injured. The way bullets and explosions always seem to miss him make it seem like John Woo films (such as Hard Boiled)are realistic enough to be documentaries. The 2 scenes I can easily point out as examples include when Cena is driving a car at the car the villians are driving, and 2 or 3 villians are unloading magazine after magazine rounds at the 'front' of the car, shattering the window, destroying the hood, and yet not one even scratches Cena who doesn't even try to dodge most of them (there's one part where he tries to put up a bullet proof vest, but that only lasts for a couple seconds, and you mine as well forget it ever happened when compared to the rest of the scene). Then the part at the end fight (with Patrick) where Cena takes a sledgehammer to the gut at a full force impact, then continues the fight 15 seconds later like nothing happened.The movie is good as a one time popcorn flick with a few buddies, but even then it would still not be enjoyable since, like in 9 out of 10 Cena matches in the WWE, Cena wins, and the opponent(s) people are really cheering for and who are overall better than Cena (in this case, Patrick has better charisma and acting skills) lose.See it if you want, but I would put it on the 'pass' list. There are worse movies than this.",

I enjoyed the movie, and while I am not a wrestling fan, I do support the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) because they support our troops all over the world. They make trips to bases every year and risk their safety to entertain the wonderful men and women of our Armed Forces! John Cena has a very likable quality, and because of his love and appreciation for our troops and their families he can rest assured that I will gladly give my dollars and support to him in whatever he undertakes.

Of course I always chose \"Just one of the guys\" because the chick playing the dude flashes the other dude the chick who's playing the dude is into (yeah, that movie is a little confusing) - but more importantly, brief nudity for the price of a PG-13.In any event, one evening the assistant manager of the store (who was later charged with murder... long story) brought in a film from Japan. It featured the usual fare - people doing weird and wacky stuff. However, during one vignette the camera focuses on the rear of a nude man.

Im not going to go into every stupid part of this movie, but ill just say its EXTREMELY unrealistic. its so bad, i think a 5 year old can point out the ridiculous things john cena \"can\" do. for example, hes able to practically fly and jump onto a moving truck from standing on the ground. he is also able to survive being inside a building that blows up and looks as though the atom bomb was dropped on it, yet somehow he still is alive. also, i might be crazy, but im pretty sure if you were holding onto a truck and being rammed through a building at fast speeds, you wouldnt live. also, not many people i know can run through walls and not be hurt. speaking of not being hurt, there is an instance in the movie while inside a burning building, john cena is hit by falling, burning wood and is unaffected. this movie is awful and i would recommend if your looking for an action movie, to look somewhere else. i cant believe people actually buy this movie and can watch it without wanting to cry.",

    "review/text": "At least once a year, along comes a film that's so wrapped up in hype and promises of greatness that you know it can't be as good as its makers would want you to believe. The distinctive model of this for 2006 was \"The Marine\", the second feature of the newly-founded WWE Films, starring ex world champion John Cena. To state plainly, this is one godawful movie: a lame and poorly-written publicity project by Vince McMahon's sports entertainment empire that can't even be redeemed by placing it under the action/adventure genre. As a fan of both the WWE and action films, I was blown away by how uninteresting and unexciting the filmmakers could make this $23 million picture, considering that it was co-written by the same fellow who penned \"Rapid Fire\", \"Spawn\", and \"Wrong Turn\", and directed by a producer of WWE - a company that is built upon fast-paced action and excitement.Let's start with the focus of this debacle - the star, John Cena. Though I feel apathetic about him as a wrestler, John Cena is most definitely not up to being an action hero: lacking the talent of Sylvester Stallone and Harrison Ford, the personality of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the moves of Jean-Claude Van Dam, the humour of Jackie Chan, and even the sincerity of character of Steven Seagal or Dolph Lundgren, Cena looks woefully out of place and confused amidst the explosions, gunfights, and combat fatigues, and doesn't even have any decent one-liners to his credit to make up for his lack of presence. Essentially, he's as bland of an action star as they get.Mind you, this wouldn't really be that much of a problem if the film featured a strong enough supporting cast to make up for the star's deficiencies, but even here \"The Marine\" falls flat: Robert Patrick (\"Terminator 2\") as the film's wannabe-crazy villain and Kelly Carlson (\"Player 5150\") as Cena's spunky kidnapped wife are not really feeling the script at any point, and neither are the half-dozen or so supporting villains - including Anthony Ray Parker (\"The Matrix\") as a token black guy who alludes to being molested at summer camp for the sake of humour - most of whom kill each other before Cena can even prove himself by beating them up.Even if we were to completely ignore the shoddy acting, there is little in either the storyline (Cena is a discharged marine whose wife is kidnapped by jewel thieves) or the action sequences to hold our attention. While the film nicely portrays the depression and \"lost\" feeling of a soldier who has just returned home from combat, and the \"man-saving-wife\" premise holds some lingering potential, the vast majority of the plot descends quickly into mundaneness, and focuses mainly on the group of villains stabbing eachother in the back and the pursuing Cena having to fight off hillbillies. The action offers absolutely nothing new or innovative: though the chase scene with Cena in the police cruiser is cool, it's a dim highlight amidst mediocrity that features standard gunfights, no martial arts, and more explosions that one expects can occur in the swamps of South Carolina.In short, \"The Marine\" does not raise the bar at all above fellow panned WWE Films \"See No Evil\" and \"The Condemned\". If they want to be taken seriously in the realm of cinema, the writers of WWE will have to stop relying on clich&eacute;-driven pictures and name-recognition to be successful. After all, Cena's flick failed to make back its budget, as did Steve Austin's \"The Condemned\". Think outside of the box, huh?",

It's nothing but total nonstop action for the last hour or so. The movie clocks in at 1 hour and 23 minutes (even though some other places have said the time length was a bit longer, it's actually not). The negative reviews are really strange to me- John Cena himself promoted the movie as nothing but an action film. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's just lots and lots of ACTION!My favorite moments were the exploding gas station and the bad guys shooting Cena's car WHILE it was flipping around in the air!

This is going to be a short review for a pretty bad movie.Before you read my review, please take not that I'm an action movie fan. Whether it's a good one with a pretty decent plot or a fun one where you can drink and laugh to it with its whack out plot and crazy actions scenes. This movie just fell short of anything fun or good.The beginning intro with Cena rescuing some marine buddies was action packed but choreographed horribly. It looked incredibly fake. My hopes for a decent movie faded quickly.One of the cooler parts of the movie was a bank heist that was led by Rome (Robert Patrick better known as T1000 from T2). If it wasn't for the horrible direction and script, Patrick would've pulled this character off in a very cool way. This scene gave me hope for an ok movie to maybe get a little drunk to and laugh at the over the top action scenes.Then comes the kidnapping. It felt like 40 minutes of the movie we watched Cena run and jump through the woods trying to rescue his girl from the bad guys. Pretty annoying.Then we see the bad guys take refuge in an abandoned bar in the middle of a swamp that the police were JUST in. Honestly I believe there would've been cops that would've stayed there JUST in case this exact scenario would have happened...but whatever... I dont expect common sense to happen in action movies... especially bad ones like this. So we have Cena taking out bad guy after bad guy here till the oh so predictable twist of the movie happens.If you like explosions, trust me about this, you'll see massive ones every 25 minutes of the movie it seems like.Also Kate (Kelly Carlson from Nip/Tuck) played a pretty good part for such a bad role. What really makes me irritated about her part though was that she gave the bad guys SUCH hell that there is no way they wouldn't have just killed her to get rid of the crap she was putting them through. Like I said earlier, I dont mind cheese in bad action movies, but this was just driving me nuts.I gave it 2 stars mainly for Robert Patrick. Like I said earlier, he played his part as well as he could for the craptastic script. I would love to see him with a similar role in a movie that's in better hands.",

A huge muscleman marine is told to wait for the rest of the soldiers on a mission. He says \"not enough time\" and charges in to blow things up. Next scene he is being discharged and has to go find a job as a security guard. This is all in the first 2 minutes of the movie. The thing that really bothered me about the movie was that everything that went on really had no point and did not make a difference later in the film. That isn't the only thing they weren't able to complete, not by a long shot. The bad guys have this big black guy on their side and he is not unfunny, they just don't give him anything funny to say. I seriously think that he didn't complete a single joke. In fact, the liquid metal guy from Terminator 2 stars as the main bad guy and they even throw in a reference to that and it was the only joke they actually completed. I thought that it was the least bad part of the movie.Now the reason I went to see this was becasue I was told it had great fights. The shootouts were nice to look at and the explosions became so repetitious I almost fell asleep, but the fights were once again just the same old I hit you and then you hit me style. The best fight of the movie included 2 characters who were never explained and this scene could have been from entirely different film for all I know.

The violence is not accurate in depiction of results, but neither is it in any movie where female stars takes full-power strikes and come bouncing back. If reality counted in the movies, there would be no girl-star action movies.The violence is actually toned down in favor of action. For example, Sgt. Triton chooses to takes out two very tough villains in exciting brawls when he has a good fighting knife with him. Reality would have been different .... and much bloodier.

My wife liked it, too, for that matter.Don't be surprised to see the knife on the market soon, ala Rambo.The acting was top-drawer within the context of the plot. I never heard of John Cena,so I can't be considered biased. Triton was seen first in front of his commanding officer, then interacting with his wife. He was supposed to be emotionally restrained with his commander, and strong but a little reflective with his wife. He was. Then The Marine had a mission. He had to complete it, not emote and burst into tears. After the adrenalin high wore off, he'd probably start shaking, but while things were going on, he didn't have time to be upset. Man, haven't the sweetie-boys who have panned his acting ever been in a fight? I never heard of the star,but he turned in a very believable good performance for the part. The excellent-looking wife did a fine job as well. No nudity in this movie. Unfortunately.In sum, a fine example of its type and highly recommended for all. It requires some suspension of belief, but most action movies do.Recommended for fans of John Cena, the WWE, and Arnold and Rambo for that matter.GunnerGunner December, 2007",

    "review/text": "You pays your money and you takes your choice. When you go to see a movie like this, you should know what you're in for. There's going to be a lot of bad guys, and they're going to be really bad. There's going to be a damsel in distress. There's going to be a surprise bad guy. And, last but not least, there's going to be a good guy who is good and tough beyond belief.John Triton (John Cena) is an heroic ex-marine whose wife, Kate (Kelly Carlson) is kidnapped by a brutal gang of jewel thieves led by Rome (Robert Patrick), who kills with glee and without remorse, which doesn't set him apart from his psychopathic gang members. John takes out after them. You get the feeling that John can take on anything up to the size of a platoon without much of a problem. While credibility might suffer during his chase, it's still fun. You will rarely see a human being with arms the size of Cena's.Written (Michelle Gallagher and Alan McElroy) and directed (John Bonito) with humor and pace, what surprised me about it was that the acting is uniformly good, including Cena. This is a tongue-in-cheek chase film with some absurdly unbelievable stunts and special effects, but it's all done on a level that nobody takes very seriously.Although there is a lot of violence, it's not graphic in the sense that we see people's heads being blown off. I was tired and sleepy when I attended the film, but never even felt a twinge of nodding off.Perfect for a saturday night with friends after a long week of work.",

Every fifteen minutes John Cena barely escapes some building blowing up. And in slow motion, of course. The story is Kelly Carlson is kidnapped by Robert Patrick and John Cena must rescue her.Robert Patrick is plain fantastic in this flick. The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great, sarcastic bad guy, plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking, thankfully. Plus, he's a hottie so...Overall, just an easy, cheesy, blow-em-up, action B-movie. The extras are pretty lame, though.",

    "review/text": "You really have to give it up to wrestling promoter Vince McMahon. He has failed miserably with the WBF, XFL and programs on MTV & he couldn't sell a quality meal in New York City. So Vince now tries that magic business touch in the film industry. Huh?It appears that Vince has just a little jealousy towards \"The Rock,\" Dwayne Johnson, and his great success making movies to the point where he doesn't need to do any bumps for the WWE and the McMahon family. Granted, Vince receives a nice sum of cash for Johnson's wrestling moniker to be used for movies, but that just isn't enough.And where Johnson has long-since passed up the 1980s-styled superhero genre, here comes Vince lumbering along in his powerwalk with his answer to The Rock, John Cena. Yes, that John Cena who was going to be a hip-hop star; until he proved that he has no hip and zero hop in his mic skills.But have a script comparable with Sylvester Stallone's ridiculous Rambo character - with Cena's mannerisms that could be termed as the nephew to the fictional tough-guy - blow all kinds of things up and Vince is in business. Hardly.The first weekend in theaters, October 13-15, 2006, The Marine did a tepid $7 million in box office sales and then sank faster than a pay-per-view main event featuring Fit Finlay.Cena plays his WWE role well, but he isn't a real actor. Vince is a wrestling promoter who has failed each time he has stepped outside the family business. The Marine was produced 20-plus years too late to have anyone but the biggest WWE Cena fans taking time to see it in theaters.And Vince better keep that cozy economic reality in mind for the next flick.",

The WWF gave us Stone Cold Steve Austin in THE CONDEMNED which was fun and Austin was great. But like THE MARINE, we see almost zero of the world famous torsoes of these super heroes. In THE CONDEMEND, Austin never takes off his shirt for one scene. And he has a body to die for. in THE MARINE, you've got about l5 seconds where we see Cena without his shirt and his body is amazing. But after that, he's fully covered. The reason I worship these wrestling super stars is because they're so damned good looking and they don't mind strutting their stuff in a pair of speedoes. One can only hope that the next WWF action thriller will give us a super star wrestler who exhibits his chest --like Schwartzenneger, Stallone, Von Damm--and give us fans something to thrill to.",

    "review/text": "'The Marine' has an instant appeal. While not innovative, it sports some eye-popping pyrotechnics and chase scenes that don't give the audience a chance to catch its breath. John Cena fans will likely be enthralled, especially since his character acquires some boxing and martial arts abilities to add to his wrestling repertoire. (Nine lives don't hurt, either.) Even the threads and riveting music draw our attention; both a modest update to 'Miami Vice,' (the TV series). Seeming random at first, John Tritan (Cena) gets established as a sort of Iraq War Rambo whose prowess will undoubtedly help him save his domestic life. Coming home, he finds his new job as a security guard dull, even if it gets him on the eleven o'clock news and another chance to come home to Kay (Kelly Carlson), his pretty young wife. The plot is simple: Jewel thieves, who score hideously for keeping a low-profile, have a show-down at a remote gas station where the military couple are also filling up for a trek to leave it all behind. Cornered, they hijack their SUV with Kay left in tow.The draw of the film may be more conservative, for its gung ho military preface and a plot where the hero saves his wife. There are drawbacks for everyone, though. The acting overall is below a television par, and the dialogue is mostly flat. Taking references meant to be funny from 'Deliverance,' 'Terminator,' and 'Freddy Krieger,' the screenwriters borrow heavily because they seldom have anything new to offer. The female feistiness also seems token, like the characters were meant not to offend the audience with any vulnerable traits. (Undoubtedly, they are also drawing more ringside entertainment as well.) An understandable draw for some, 'The Marine' will undoubtedly please no matter how predictable it may seem. 'Die Hard 2' with Bruce Willis did the same story a couple decades ago and did it better.",

Especially if you take the film makers seriously. The black villain in the story is such a stereo-type of the bad guy obsessed with getting in touch with his blackness. Arch-type - that's what he is. Not a stereotype, but a stand in for all African Americans or rather, the personification of a certain ideology. Perhaps just a reality. This may be done intentionally, that's my opinion. He's not shown to be a reliable character in the film. Just be a person, not a Black man. Perhaps just avoid black men if possible. . . ? Building understanding. . . perhaps - but this film does nothing to improve race relations. Who said the Marines are about better race relations? At least we'd like to imagine they aren't.",

I wont even get into that rats nest of crap. So he is discharged from the Marines and is trying to start working a civilian job. While on a road trip with his wife some people who robbed a jewelery store and happened to stop at the same gas station end up kidnapping his wife and begins his outrageously stupid and ill scripted pursuit. Fact is John was able to track his targets through the marsh and swamp while quite often they were on a road. The thought process that i have would be is that they could take any back road/dirt road or anything that connect to the main road they would be gone and he would be heading in the completely wrong direction. However somehow he is always able to find the bad guys. My biggest complain is that it is a movie about a Marine and he never really uses a gun, he takes them and never uses them. I think the person who wrote it doesn't realize that every Marine is a rifleman and i cannot think of one who wouldn't use a gun to protect his wife. This movie is your standard WWE/WWF film that solves everything with hand to hand combat scenes. I mean come on if i would of wanted to watch a fighting movie then that is what i would've bought. However i bought a movie titled MARINE i fully expect there to be FIREFIGHTS and shooting. That is what really irritates me along with the pathetic acting is that it doesn't make sense. Marines are trained to use guns but this guy doesn't seem to use them even when his wife is in danger.I'm not really sure i can convey to you how bad this movie is.It would be a good film for people who prefer hand to hand combat and like movies with really bad acting and holes in the plot so big you can drive a semi truck threw them.This movie starts out bad and just gets worse and worse.Horrible Movie 1/5 stars.",

    "review/text": "Firstly, let me tell you that if you are an elite critic and watched this movie, ask yourself why. Do you even like the action-movie genre? No? Then don't waste our time by writing reviews about stuff you don't enjoy. We like it here and we like Hollywood. So astalavistababy.For all WWE Fans and those who have come to see John Cena blow things up by more than just his fist - this is an awesome action flick. I too came to see this movie because I am a fan of WWF now known as WWE and because I admire John Cena as a person and not just as what we see him do inside the squared ring.The first 5 to 10 minutes of the movie needs to be passed over. To be forgiven. It is not the best start to an action movie. And this is an out and out thriller of an action movie. But then Robert Patrick shows up and everything rocks and everything is cool again. Yes, I came to see Cena and got bowled over by Robert Patrick. Patrick carries this movie. I would say he saved the movie. Cena is great. He is our hero. And we cheer for him throughout the movie as he gets beat while trying to rescue his dear wife. But you can't help fall for Robert Patrick. He waltzes in all bad-a$$ and mean. He is ultra, uber-cool. He makes the badguy role come alive and give meaning to the whole story. As in any story, for the hero to be a hero, you need a strong adversary. We get that in the form of a team of criminals led by Robert Patrick.The action is non-stop. As soon as the villain has done his first job in the movie - the action keeps up the tempo and we get big gunfights and bigger explosions. The crazy black dude routine is well played here by a henchman of Patrick. I was a bit disappointed with the truth behind the \"rock candy story\" - they should have made it as big as it sounded. But there is plenty of more fun in the movie. Some dark humour and Cena is incredible as he chases down the bad guys in the mandatory car chase sequence and then on in the swamps. This is thrilling from there till the very end. Some good hand-to-hand fights. Cena gets punished and he triumphs. The deviation with the 2 other crooks in the same swamp thinking Cena is a cop looking for them is also brilliant turn of events. More action. More a$$-kicking. The scenes with the explosion are very well shot.The two big ones with Cena at the petrol pump explosion and him at the shack in the swamp exploding are incredibly well captured. You could feel Cena getting the fury of the fire. Awesome stuff. And Patrick is unstoppable too. He is determined and he has the wife as a leverage and hostage. There is the essential bad girl accompanying the villain, Patrick. She does a great job, better I think than the actress who plays Cena's wife. In all I would rate high the casting as the team of Patrick is well picked bunch of actors doing what they do best. These bad guys are worth cheering for.Cena of course makes it to the climax. An epic one it is, involving a truck, a motorboat, explosions, fistfights, splattering of blood and the suspense of whether Cena's wife will survive this ordeal or not.Watch this one and make sure you reload the popcorn.",

The marine chases after these guys, killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie. This movie is filled with every single action movie clich&eacute; and it didn't thrill in the slightest. It wasn't even bad enough to be good. It was just bad. It stunk.",

    "review/text": "The Marine is a film about a marine that has just been discharged and is back home with his wife. When she's kidnapped by the bad guys, the game is on. It's an action movie and I think most people can spot what this movie is going to be like from that description. So if you're not a person that enjoys action movies like Rambo or Commando then I can safely say that you won't enjoy this film. It's still a paint-by-numbers affair so it's doubtful you'd suddenly find yourself enjoying this type of film.But I am someone who enjoys action movies like Rambo and Commando. So I waited till I found myself in the right mood to watch an action romp, and I stuck this DVD in. The movie starts out with some promise. After John Cena's character is discharged from the military, he takes a job as a security guard. The scene that followed that was fairly entertaining - with Cena throwing around his weight. While that scene is entertaining, it is also meant to show that Cena's character is miserable outside of marine life. This hints at some inner turmoil that is then left behind completely and never again brought up in the film.Robert Patrick does a great job as the bad guy. I thought he was very good. I did not care for his henchmen as they didn't seem to bring anything to the table. Likewise, John Cena is not an actor. He doesn't need to be in an action movie if the plot is compelling but it's really not. There aren't any memorable action scenes that stick out in my mind as I reflect back so all I am recalling is the awkward delivery that John Cena had. I also didn't care for his character's wife; who was very attractive but had a quality about her that said there was nothing going on upstairs. The pair is not a couple who are developed characters; the wife especially comes off as an arrogant shrew and so as a viewer, I'm not invested in the film when she is kidnapped.All in all, this movie would have been a better film as a focus on Robert Patrick's jewelery store heist and escape. That was much more interesting than The Marine and his walk through a swamp. But that's just my opinion.sincerely,R.C.",

    "review/text": "John Cena plays John Triton, a Marine who was discharged after disobeying a direct order in order to save his fellow soldiers in war. He returns home to his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) and after not being able to adjust to his homelife so easliy, they take a vacation. Unfortunally John ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time as he crosses paths with a group of jewel thieves at a gas station led by a killer named Rome (Robert Patrick) and after things don't go as planned, they go on the run & kidnap Kate as a hostage. From there, John goes after the thieves to save his wife but encounter many obsticals along with the way while the theives have problems of their own such as not being to trust each other & Kate being tougher than she looks.This is one of those generic action movies where the plot itself was very simple & something the average person can understand. The acting isn't much as Cena had no previous acting experience before this role so his dialog is very limited but did do well & was believeable in his role. They have good action scenes from a car chase to fist fights to tons of explosions. The most annoying thing here though was that they tried to add comedy to this movie which didn't work at all. For example, when the bad guys are in the jungle running from the police...that's not the time to start making jokes about \"rock candy\" & getting calls about their cable TV package eventhough I did get a chuckle as the priceless look Patrick gave after the \"he's like the Terminator\" line.While the DVD included both the unrated & theatrical versions of the movie, the DVD extras include all the WWE promotional features, footage of the World Premiere, various features on John Cena, and a \"Making Of\" featurette. Bottom line is that this movie is good for those who just like a good old action flick that you used to see back in the 80's full of explosions & fist fight scenes.",

No depth, no brains, just blow up things at random and find things to bicker and whine about... Especially trying to bring racism into the fray... lets blame the senseless violence on the \"black guy\". The character happened to be a black guy and had a penchant for self-destruction... and blowing everything else up as well. I personally found that little whining episode offensive no matter how you chose to interpret it.The character development of John Triton was pretty good, but established him as more of a loose cannon rather than a highly skilled combat individual. This is further reinforced when he gets into fights and essentially uses his face to block many of the punches. That may work in the WWE, but does not establish a character who is supposed to be highly skilled in hand/hand combat.Some of the scenes in the movie seemed to be filler to get minutes. Especially his encounter with the two poachers while running through the swamp.However, the movie still managed to be fun to watch, once I was able to adjust my expectations for the movie to be WWE entertainment, and not as a full action movie.Overall, you can enjoy this movie if you choose to, it isn't a total loss, but neither is it a winner.",

He is struggling to adapt to civilian life and hold onto his relationship with his wife when she is abducted in a bank robbery.As his life crumbles and the police seem less interested in recovering his wife, he goes the vigilante route, tracking, interrogating and diving into dangerous situations, ultimately leading him to Las Vegas where he uncovers a large scale plot that is bigger than he or anyone could ever imagine.Other than the fact that my script is more complex and has better dialogue, the biggest difference between my script and THE MARINE is that the lead character in my script is REAL. A real, flesh and blood, human being Marine with vulnerabilities, emotions and he actually bleeds. He's a real person, like somebody you might know from your town who went to Iraq.While THE MARINE'S John Triton (John Cena) is bulletproof, explosion proof, dives through walls unscratched, hangs onto semi-trucks while it drives through buildings and despite the bombardment of boards, pipes and tin sheets, he rolls off and groans before jumping up and kicking more butt. Not to mention, I don't think a scene goes by that he doesn't remind everybody that he's a Marine and it's the only thing he knows. By the way, the tin sheets would have severed him, easily.Oh, and of course the name Triton is appropriate to refer to John Cena as a Greek God or the largest moon of Neptune.Ridiculous is an understatement. This movie insults our intelligence with a symplistic, unrealistic, poorly written story. Deplorable acting from all involved. Was this movie trying to be a comedy? The jewl thieves are idiots and are more concerned with trying to be comedic than to try to come up with a plan to escape.The real shame is that my script is pretty well useless now. The creators of this movie make dozens of references to my script in the early goings and now my script is old news. Unfortunately, hollywood big wigs have put their MONEY behind THE MARINE, a silly, poorly written, poorly thought out, poorly acted piece of junk.You need more than dozens of unrealistic and over-the-top explosions to grab this reviewer. Unfortunately, I have a brain, and I need more from my action movie than this stupid movie that has absolutely nothing in it that is memorable or meritable.",

Decent action like some of Arnold's early works (e.g. Commando and Red Heat), but not the best acting just like them. If you got a couple hours to blow and want to see a new action movie this will fit the bill. I suggest rental as this does not have alot of replayability in my book. Even my two young stepsons that were Marines weren't impressed. A good popcorn no brainer action movie. If you own any of Schwarzenegger's movies your time would be better spent watching them again. Don't get me wrong I really hope that Cena's career in movies will continue. With time I'm sure his acting will improve as Schwartzenegger's did. Let's face it the movie had potential if the acting was better or they threw in more comedy. About the only funny thing in the movie was when one of the bad guys says, \"He's like the Terminator\", when talking about the Marine, and then Robert Patrick, who played a Terminator in \"Terminator 2\" gives a steely glance at him. If this turns out to be the only movie Cena makes I have to vote for \"Chill Factor\" with Skeet Ulrich or \"Firestorm\" with Howie Long over this one. If they had added in more humor I think it would have worked better.Story Synopsis: A decorated Marine is discharged for disobeying orders for not leaving a man behind against orders. His first day on the job as a security guard he throws a man through the window and is fired. His wife and him take a vacation and she is taken hostage when robbers are identified by police at a gas station. The Marine chases them to get his wife back. Lots of carnage ensues as police, innocent bystanders, and criminals are butchered and slain.",

He keeps the pacing going well. I had no clue who John Cena was, and wondered how he grabbed an action lead. After seeing the DVD extras of his wrestling career, I understand how he was cast and remembered him from channel surfing. His reactions are fairly wooden without many levels that we'd expect from a more experienced actor. But he gets an \"A\" for effort and completed many of his own stunts.Robert Patrick who was the bad guy in \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" and had a small part in Clint Eastwood's \"Flags of Our Fathers\" plays the bad guy Rome who engineers a bank heist. Patrick looks like he's smart enough to plan the caper, but has a screw loose enough to result in the chaos and trail of bodies.Kelly Carlson from \"Nip & Tuck\" and many appearances on \"CSI\" plays Kate Triton, the wife who gets abducted. The brief love scenes looked like both actors were having fun and convinced us of a romantic relationship, although there wasn't much more marital emotional depth beyond that. She looked great.Her female nemesis is played by Abigail Bianca who portrays the trigger happy gang moll with expertise. She excels at the action sequences. My favorite shot in the film is when she is flung through glass and diamonds are scattered, some of them red with blood.The very best performance in the film, however, is one of the gang members named Bennett. Creatively named, he is played by New Zealand actor Manu Bennett. He seems to be the one in the gang with intelligence and emotional realism. His fight scene with John Cena is excellent. I was sad to see him bite the dust.Overall, the film was about what I expected. Perhaps the acting wasn't quite as good as I'd anticipated. However, it picked me up in the action and carried me through swamps and explosions to the final frame. I enjoyed the DVD extra showing the film premiere at the military base with our fighting men and women. This is a good film for an evening's entertainment. Enjoy!",

The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and throws in knowing references to other 'blow-em up' films [including a Terminator line for the sake of lead baddie Robert Patrick]. There's nothing new or really eye popping to see here. It is a formula driven testerone fest that does all the usual things that movies like this are supposed to do and it is all pulled off fairly well. Don't go into it expecting Bourne-like intrigue; however, don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking how much John Cena looks like Bourne actor Matt Damon from the neck up. If there were a Bourne spoof Cena would be a no-brainer to play the title character.",

    "review/text": "I really hope the American Military didn't support this movie considering how things are going over there in order to recruit more bodies. If so that was a poor attempt. After watching this movie it left me quite speechless. War is entirely different, and should not be made glamorous for recruiting purposes.\"The Marine\" is a very simple film with a few minor twists here and there. In the tradition of The Rock, John Cena has begun a movie career after gaining notoriety as a wrestler. Both wrestlers/actors are muscle bound former college football players. Whereas The Rock has now proven he can act in a variety of roles, Cena has just proven that he can do action. His role in \"The Marine\" is evidence that he may very well be successful in films, but he will need to find better material than this. The directing here is nothing special, but seeing this is John Bonito's first feature, I have nothing to support my cause as I have nothing more to base it on, but he is able to deliver a film that is very easy and even if Bonito got a little explosion happy. The plot however, is pointless. Throughout this movie these imbecile thieves call attention to themselves every chance they get. After robbing a jewelry store, they don't just stroll away as no one outside knows what they did. They blow up a cop car. Why? I have no idea. One member of the group is prone to telling sad stories of his youth. Too often the camera lingers on the bad guys and then quickly gives us a shot of Cena running. Sure, Patrick is a bigger movie star than Cena, but this is Cena's movie. I really did not care about the bad guys other than how Cena is going to kick their [...].I will say that Cena has the build and look of an action hero in the grain of Jean-Claude Van Damme. He fits right in with the 'unstoppable 80's action hero mold.' He is 90% muscle and 10% charm. He has few lines of dialogue but does well enough with what he has. Robert Patrick hammed it up, but seemed to relish playing a wise-cracking psychotic murderer. No one else is worth mentioning, as it seems paychecks were just collected. Cena, who is also a rapper, had also been wearing military attire at his matches. No doubt he is doing so for publicity sake of this movie, which celebrates Marines as heroes which is great but nothing he can do is going to generate enough interest to make \"The Marine\" a success.",

    "review/summary": "Fun to watch! . . . If you like sheer action & pure entertainment, it won't disappoint you. Guaranteed!",
    "review/text": "Last night, I sat comfortably on the sofa at home to watch two action movies consecutively on Star Movies Channel.The two movies share one common feature: They were no-brainers! That is to say, they were pure entertainment, & best of all, you don't need a brain to figure out what the story in each movie was all about.Once in a while, I like to watch no-brainer movies, just for the fun of it. Sometimes, just for random stimuli. so to speak!The two movies were:- 'The Marine', starring John Cena & Robert Patrick;- 'Transporter 2', starring Jason Statham;The first movie was, to me, beautifully choreographed with fiery pyrotechnics & gun blazing actions all the way, from start to finish. There wasn't a dull moment.It had a very simple story plot: A gang of merciless diamond robbers on the run, kidnapped the wife of a recently discharged US marine from Iraq, who later went on a long chase through the marshland & wilderness of South Carolina to save her.At the onset, I did not realised that the movie was actually a promotional vehicle for the people behind those seemingly senseless head-banging & body-crushing wrestling tournaments on television. John Cena was one of those guys.Since I don't like to watch any of their televised wrestling matches, I got to see, at least in this action movie, a lot of his wrestling manoeuvres as he threw those robbers & some other bad guys who stood in his way.Acting-wise, John Cena was somewhat kayu (a colloquial term for 'wooden'), but he had quite a naturally likable disposition. He certainly reminds me of Dwayne Johnson, known as The Rock, the wrestling guy turned actor (e.g. 'The Scorpion King', 'Walking Tall', 'The Rundown', 'Doom', just to name a few), especially with the cheeky wink.Physically, John Cena was huge, but who cares, as long as he could fight & clobber the bad guys in the movie.I reckon the only actor who really stood out in the movie was Robert Patrick, who played the leader of the robbers. He had certainly put on a lot of weight, when compared to the first time I saw him in the second part of the Terminator trilogy, as model T1000. I also recall him as an FBI agent in the 'X-Files' television series.This movie actually reminds me of two two action movies I had watched before, namely, 'The Punisher', starring Thomas Jane as a DEA agent turned vigilante, Frank Castle, & 'The Mechanik', starring Dolph Lundgren as Nikolai Cherenko, an ex-operative from the Russian Special Forces.Together with 'The Marine', they shared one unique & yet common feature: It's all about the adventurous exploits of a one-man fighting &/or destruction machine!The second movie was actually a sequel to 'Transporter', also starring the same actor.Both 'Transporter' movies were apparently hemmed by the famous French action director, Luc Besson, famous for his action flicks, 'Taxi I to IV'.His other movie credits also included 'Nikita', 'The Professional', 'Kiss of the Dragon' (with Jet Li in starring role), 'Wasabi', 'Unleashed' (again with Jet Li in starring role) & 'Hitman' (which I had not yet watched);In both the 'Transporter' movies, Jason Statham played Frank Martin, a retired US Special Forces operative, now turned mercenary transporter of cargo & people, with no questions asked.In this particular one, he was unwittingly implicated in an engineered kidnap attempt of a young boy he was supposed to protect. The young boy was the son of a powerful US government official, involved in cross-border anti-narcotics policy making.The bad guys were the Colombian drug cartel, who had financed a team of rogues led by a real nut case, called Gianni, who had injected a deadly virus into our hero to force him to do all the dirty work.The rest of the movie centred on our hero fighting for his life, as he systematically tracked down & eventually neutralised all the bad guys, while also succeeding in getting the young boy out of harm's way. It was quite fun to watch our hero replicating some of Jackie Chan's signature fighting antics in the movie.I read that Jason Statham had some sort of martial arts background, which probably explained his physical prowess & agility, just like Jean Claude van Damme, in the fighting sequences.For me, the best action sequence in the movie was the segment, when our hero drove his beefed-up Audi up an incline to fly into the air, with an ingenious somersault manoeuvre to dislodge a time-bomb attached to the under portion of the car, with the timely aid of a large hook suspended from a harbour crane located nearby. Wow, that was really cool!Just like the first movie, there wasn't a dull moment in this one, as it was also beautifully choreographed with adrenalin-pumping action sequences throughout, from start to finish.Acting-wise, Jason Statham probably fared better than John Cena in my view. His many acting credits included 'Ghosts of Mars', 'The One' (with Jet Li), 'Italian Job', 'Cellular', 'Chaos', 'Crank' & latest 'Rogue Assassins' (with Jet Li, which I have yet to watch).The bottomline of my movie review: The two action movies, although seemingly no-brainers, have been real fun to watch, at least for me. If you like sheer action & pure entertainment, they won't disappoint you. Guaranteed!",

    "review/text": "I am afraid that some reviews I have seen show either an anti-military bias or else expect things of this movie they would not demand of others of its type. The movie is not political in ANY way, but there is a fairly heroic brief starting episode in Iraq; I guess some don't like that.This is in fact a terrific action/adventure movie in the mold of the Rambo or Schwarzenegger films (eg \"Commando\") or the Indiana Jones series. The violence is not accurate in depiction of results, but neither is it in any movie where female stars takes full-power strikes and come bouncing back. If reality counted in the movies, there would be no girl-star action movies.The violence is actually toned down in favor of action. For example, Sgt. Triton chooses to takes out two very tough villains in exciting brawls when he has a good fighting knife with him. Reality would have been different .... and much bloodier. Not much gore or blood in this picture, however, and you can safely take your pre-teen or teen son. Or yourself. My wife liked it, too, for that matter.The acting was top-drawer within the context of the plot. I never heard of John Cena,so I can't be considered biased. Triton was seen first in front of his commanding officer, then interacting with his wife. He was supposed to be emotionally restrained with his commander, and strong but a little reflective with his wife. He was. Then The Marine had a mission. He had to complete it, not emote and burst into tears. After the adrenalin high wore off, he'd probably start shaking, but while things were going on, he didn't have time to be upset. Man, haven't the sweetie-boys who have panned his acting ever been in a fight? I never heard of the star,but he turned in a very believable good performance for the part. The excellent-looking wife did a fine job as well. No nudity in this movie. Unfortunately.In sum, a fine example of its type and highly recommended for all. It requires some suspension of belief, but most action movies do. It will grab you hard and keep you watching.",

Yeah, there are plot holes, logic bombs and more cheesy dialogue than Kraft could put in a dozen commercials, but this doesn't stop the movie from being a lot of fun to watch.WWE wrestling superstar John Cena plays John Triton, a U.S. Marine who has been scapegoated and dishonorably discharged for disobeying an order from commanding officers and is making an adjustment to civilian life with his hot wife. He gets a job at a security firm where...he gets fired for disobeying an order. After this mishap he and his wife decide to go away where at a gas station they run afoul of some diamond smugglers who kill a cop and kidnap take his wife for a hostage so they can make their getaway. In the quest to get her back, Triton goes through car chases, explosions, and death defying scenarios. It's best not to take these too seriously; this is the kind of action movie where you turn your brain off and enjoy the show.Despite the logic holes, The Marine reminds me of the kind of old-fashioned action movie I used to watch back in the late 1980's-1990's like American Ninja or Ninja III: The Domination (WHY ISN'T THIS ON DVD YET!) Low budget movies that were full of over the top stunts, car chases, big explosions and clich&eacute; lines from the heroes. The kind of movie you turn your brain off for two hours and unwind with. The kind of movies I'd watch on a Saturday afternoon when I had nothing else to doJohn Cena is fun to watch as Triton, he has great charisma and a strong screen presence that keeps you watching in spite of the campy script. He shows the potential to be a solid B-action star in the not unlike Michael Dudikoff or Michael Pare. Kelly Carson is good as Triton's wife. She does the best she can with the weak script she's given.

    "review/text": "This is rather fun to watch although it is completely over the top in being unrealistic.Although most action shows tend to be extreme in the situations that the star survives and thrives in, this one puts virtually all others to shame in that regard. That is unfortunate as it is a storyline that could have proven to be a great movie if it were written better.It features John Triton (John Cena) as a former Marine who was kicked out of the Corps for disobeying an order. Of course, had he obeyed the order, many American lives would have been lost. Nevertheless, he was scapegoated and discharged.One day he and his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) are at a convenience store when a group of thugs kills a cop. They then take Kate hostage, which proves to be a very poor decision for them as John is a commando the makes Rambo look like a wimp in comparison. The bad guys are about to have a very bad day indeed.This really could have been a great show, but there are way too many extreme fires/explosions that get Triton. If the writers would have toned that part down just a bit, this might have been a four or even a five star show. Hardcore actions fans will probably enjoy it, but it comes off as a bit too hokey for many others.",

The acting wasn't too bad, but they tried to put humor in that I think only a WWE fan would appreciate. There was one funny moment I liked that referenced Terminator. It's a decent action movie if you just put logic aside and enjoy the ride. I'm not a wrestling fan, so most of actors were unknown to me. It's worth a rent just for the car chase.",

    "review/text": "\"The Marine\" reminds me of the old-fashioned action films made in the 1980s like Arnold Schwarzenegger's \"Commando.\" If you remember this film, our hero is a retired elite commando, single-handedly saves the kidnapped daughter, and kills all the bad guys. The story is incredible, I know, but fun nonetheless.In \"The Marine\" WWE's John Cena plays that hero John Triton, a marine discharged for disobeying the direct orders. The difference here is that the hero has to rescue his wife kidnapped by the diamond robbers and the gangs' leader is played by Robert Patrick. And watching \"Commando\" is more fun.Frankly I don't care the wooden acting of the cast and the predicable (and unrealistic) story as long as the film provides good actions. Actually I found John Cena is not that bad as critics say, and Kelly Carlson as his wife did a fine job. Also \"The Marine\" has one car chases with good stunt and one funny one-liner about Robert Patrick's career making role.But things start to look silly when these actions are drawn-out. There are scenes big explosions, but they only help lower the film's tension as the poorly-written storyline and choppy editing make it clear that none of these poses a danger to the protagonist who can easily survive and go to the next set-piece. Moreover, it's not exciting to see the baddies fighting among them more then once. It's not thrilling to watch them trudging through thick mud of the swamp, either.\"The Marine\" is an old-school action film that needs someone capable of handling the materials (themselves not bad) in a much better form.",

    "review/text": "THE MARINEI have to admit that I have enjoyed all of the 7 or 8 or something like that WWE produced films, this one in particular. Sure some have been better then others but all have at least been entertaining, this one here would be in that category. I always liked John Cena especially when he was a heel, he has always been entertaining. So once WWE really wanted to get going with the movies I knew Cena would be starring in one. I am glad that the film did well enough at the box office for them to let him do another. I found this movie to be very enjoyable even though it is flawed.The movie is about John Triton an ex marine who is having a hard time adjusting to his new life as a civilian. After a mishap at a security guard job he took he and his wife decided to go on a trip to any were just to get away on vacation. It is on this trip that they run into some trouble at a gas station, it turns out that some people who are also there just robbed a diamond place and is on the run. When things go wrong Triton's wife is kidnapped by these guys and the chase is on. So the rest of the movie we are treated to an action filled adventure that pits one man's love for his wife against those who have a lust for money and power.The strong point of this film is obviously the ridiculous unbelievable action sequences, and I do mean unbelievable. Michell Gallagher and Alan McElroy did a decent job with the script basically just adding a few words to pages full of explosions and fist fights. For this, a WWE film that is just fine and I did not expect any thing else so it makes perfect sense. Director John Bonito shows that he has a talent for making a fun yet over the top action flick and he even makes Cena look good in his first acting gig, so credit to you sir. Director of photography David Eggby did a great job shooting this movie as the camera work is great, Executive producer Vince McMahon knows how to hire the right people. Every one behind the scenes did what a consider a good job given that this was supposed to be a WWE action movie, job well done.As far as the acting I think that while Cena has a way to go before he wins any Oscars he actually does a good job with this film, he has a natural charisma that carries over onto the screen. At times it looks like the performance is forced but over all he does a pretty good job in my opinion, I don't know why but I think he would be perfect in a comedy or a family comedy. Kelly Carlson is good as Cena's wife and brings a nice little charm to the film even though at times she gets rough with the other characters. Robert Patrick is great in the lead villain role with a sly humor to him, and his partner Abigail Bianca is just as good. In fact to be honest no one does a bad job in this film and in fact all of them do very well for this type of film.I liked this movie I thought it was a fun over the top action flick in the vain of 80's movies [like other reviews have said]; it is a good weekend/afternoon movie. A lot of people talk bad about this movie and John Cena in particular, but I liked it and Cena. I think if Cena is given time to develop as an actor I think he could actually be good. Hopefully he has developed more for the upcoming \"12 Rounds\"; I will go see it keep up the WWE streak. Hope to see ya there.",

    "review/text": "Pro wrestler John Cena flexes his acting muscles and discovers that, alas, when it comes to cinema, he's a 98 pound sissy. Having said that, THE MARINE is not the most abysmal of B-movies. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is: a modest actioner sponging off the quasi-hot commodity that is John Cena. I quite enjoyed the deliberate tongue-in-cheek, off-the-wall tone in some parts of the flick, which was a respite from all the uninspired swamp chasing and the mind-numbing, been there, done that heroics and explosions. Truth to tell, this picture is worth watching most for Robert Patrick's wiggy bad guy performance. Now this cat was having fun.The plot: Ex-sergeant John Triton (John Cena) may have been dishonorably discharged, but he still considers himself a marine at heart. Back in the civilian world, he becomes a rent-a-cop and, on his first day on the job, gets promptly sacked. As a consolation prize, he's talked into getting away from it all and ventures on a road trip with his beautiful wife Kate (Kelly Carlson). But this ends up being one of the most heinous of holidays ever as the Tritons bump into a gang of diamond thieves at a gas station, which then becomes the site of a shoot-out and results in Kate being kidnapped. What happens next is Triton channeling his inner marine, stolidly trekking thru the messy portions of South Carolina, and semper-fying the crap out of the hooligans and knuckleheads what done him wrong.Thespian newbie John Cena is earnest, I'll give him that, and must've graduated with honors from the School of Posing Heroically and Surviving Big Kabooms. No, Cena doesn't really distinguish himself from all the other would-be heir to Schwarzenegger's kingdom (the Rock, Vin Diesel, Jason Statham). In fact, he's not even as good as the action stars in the parentheses. If this was still the '90s, he'd be *ouch* Brian Bosworth. Now, maybe that last one's a bit too harsh. Cena is adequate, if torpid, in his first picture outing and even threatens to show niggling bits of potential. But, when one thug comments, \"This guy's like the Terminator.\", well, no, he's not. Think what you will about Ah-nuld's acting, part of his box office clout was due to his self-deprecating sense of humor. In future films (should there be any), Cena needs to loosen up a bit. Or a lot. Even Jason Bourne thinks this guy's too impassive. On the positive side, John Cena is ripped like crazy. Even his Adam's apple is cut.So just how much fun was Robert Patrick having in this flick? He steals all the scenes, along with the diamonds, and delivers his lines with such obvious relish. His quirky and amusing take on his role is what kept me watching up until the end, where, as one reviewer pointed out, Cena administered a very dubious brand of CPR. Kelly Carlson also makes a good showing as the not-quite-hapless hostage and all around hottie, although she could've grieved just a bit more for her hubbie when he's first assumed dead over a cliff. I'm always up for a girl on girl brawl, and Kelly has several with equally tasty bad girl (naughty girl?) Abigail Bianca. By the way, it says something about the charisma-challenged Cena that even the henchmen end up being more interesting. One gets the feeling that, when not pulling bank heists, this motley crew of crooks puts in some massive down time in deep therapy. For real, they've got issues.Action sequences and stunts? So-so. With both having a wrestling background, it's only natural, I guess, that Cena and the Rock are studied under the same light. But it's not even close as Cena hands down pales in that comparison. The Rock just seems to be more kinetic and just more...aware. He knows how to play to his movie audience. Cena is still learning the Hollywood ropes. And it doesn't serve him at all that his fight scenes are boringly choreographed and that the car chase and explosions are run-of-the-mill. Was there even a real sense of jeopardy at any point in the film?Two and a half stars for THE MARINE, with a special shout out going to Robert Patrick for his just-a-wee-bit-mental performance.",

Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back. WWE could have easily found someone better. Skip this movie. In fact do someone a favor, buy the dvd and destroy it so no one would have to witness this horrible movie.

While at a gas station, Kate is kidnapped by a jewel thief named Rome, and his associates. John goes on a 1-man rampage in order to get her back.

Especially we enjoyed seeing the premiere of the movie at USMC Camp Pendleton. I wish we had had a John Cena movie when I was in the Corps. If you want beginning-to-end romping, stomping, hell, death and destruction....this flick is for YOU! The Terminator has nothing on the character of former Marine Triton. To say it is unbelievable doesn't even begin to cover it. BUT who wants reality in an adventure film. Get this and watch it with friends.",

    "review/text": "THE MARINE proves yet again that an action movie needs to have the focus on the hero and his motivation. When a film like this one has some truly outstanding fiery explosions to maintain a viewer's interest, that attention span will last only for as long as do the FX, and even with that there are diminishing returns. John Cena, the WWE wrestler, is John Triton, an ex-Marine discharged from the Corps only because he disobeyed orders to save the lives of three fellow marines. You would think his commanding officer would have understood. He takes a job as a security officer and gets fired immediately, again for just doing his job. The primary problem with THE MARINE is the expectation that one has in terms of why one sees this film. I choose to see action movies that have a hard to achieve balance between the exploits of the action star and the believability of the plot. Stallone had no problem doing that in any of his RAMBO films. Cena has a long way to go to find this happy medium.Robert Patrick is the Bad Guy. He mugs, makes unwelcome advances to Cena's wife, and generally conducts a criminal campaign on the fly. You know that an action film is off kilter when the Bad Guy by default becomes the focus of interest. Cena does little more than take beatings, give beatings, narrowly escape death in fiery car crashes, and scowl on cue. If Cena has a future in acting, that future is probably in the ring as a wrestler.",

    "review/text": "At the outset, it is prudent to state the obvious: action movies are prone to having sequences that are not believable. No matter how good (or bad) the action flick, this remains true. However, some action movies push the envelope so far beyond the realm of believability that the movies become more like cartoons rather than films to be taken seriously.Such is the case with this present movie. There are huge explosions in which people walk away unscathed. A police car gets shot to pieces by about a thousand bullets, then flies off a cliff, yet our hero waltzes away as insouciantly as though he's returning from Walmart with a bag of groceries.The casting of the story is decent. Robert Patrick is nice & sinister and as such plays a good bad guy, and there is a cute reference toTerminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD). John Cena is certainly buffed up enough to be a credible action hero, but the problem is he has no acting prowess whatsoever. He makes fellow wrestler-turned-actor The Rock look like Charleton Heston.By far & away the best performance belongs to Kelly Carlson. It is clear that she has bona-fide acting talents, most of which are wasted in this farce of an action movie. I do hope to see more of her in the future - much more!Beyond the believability aspect of the film, the pacing is pretty lousy. The opening scene shows the hero doing heroic things on a mission against terrorists in Iraq. I think the movie would have been much better had they stretched out this scene another 20 minutes, as it was actually interesting. Instead, they stretch out the last 1/2 of the film, and things move along at a snail's pace.Also, it appears that the filmmakers were a bit torn on which direction they wanted the movie to go, ratings wise. It had a few golden opportunities for un-contrived gratuitous nudity. Unfortunately, they held back, ostensibly just for the PG-13 rating. Had they made an \"R\" version of the movie, it would have been a lot better. I would have loved to see Ms. Carlson topless!All-in-all, this movie is for action movie junkies only. And, even they will wince at just how un-believable some of the sequences are. For myself, I hope that John Cena goes to acting school before making another film. Hey, it DID work wonders for Arnie!",

He then stresses to his friend that \"being a marine is what he did best\". Then on a trip with his wife she's taken hostage by jewel thieves. They carry big guns and blow stuff up but while acting like the kind of baffoons you'd see in a Home Alone movie. Robert Patrick is cool as the leader of the bad guys but he gets so many goofy lines that it's hard to take him seriously. I think he's a wasted actor. I mean his performance in Walk the Line and other serious roles show that. Plus no he did not kill the X-Files like many fans say. The show trying to continue without Mulder killed the X-Files. He was pretty good in it.Anyway this movie doesn't know if it's an action thriller or action comedy. Plus I don't know why people praise the stunts. It's like wannabe Transporter or Transporter 2 type action. Plus with so many huge explosions you'd think that at least one person would die in them. But John Cena escapes every huge explosion without a mark on him.We also have seen how many movies where the heroe takes one bad guy at a time as one after another goes looking for him one after another. It worked a lot better for Die Hrad than it does for this film though. Now the good about the movie. It offers sexy women and although I'm not the biggest John Cena fan I can't say he's a bad action star. He has the right look even if he does basically give a one note performance. He's a marine and he makes sure we think of him as nothing but a marine. The script also makes sure we just think of him as nothing but a dangerous marine that loves his wife too. Since that's all we ever learn about him. It's just a fast paced brainless action film so it doesn't need any character build-up.",

The beginning starts off quite nicely with our \"Marine\" taking down 9 terrorist with a machine gun and hand-to-hand combat, without even being touched. The problem is later in the movie our same \"Marine\" is knocked down with a fire extinguisher, a branch, and a bar. Apparently terrorists trained in the military with machine guns are much less capable than a man with a fire extinguisher.Second, the \"Marine\" was knocked unconscious by both the fire extinguisher and tree branch yet being punched hard multiple times tied to a chair, he is left un-phased.Third, our \"Marine\" seems to get punched a lot for being such a skilled fighter. Even going up against hill billies he gets thrown through a table. Which also shows hill billies are skilled in hand to hand combat, a reality this movie taught me.Fourth, no one seems to care that our well respected \"Marine\" leaves a wounded cop unattended and steals a cop car. Throughout the movie he causes hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage without being reprimanded.Fifth, a good portion of the movie consist of our \"Marine\" following people through the woods. That's it.... Wow.... Exciting.....Sixth, our marine jumps out of a flaming car over the edge of a cliff. 10 minutes later he is walking on land. Apparently it is left to our imagination how marines can fly.Seventh, When our \"Marine\" gives CPR its just pathetic. It looks funny to begin with because John Cena's arms are as big as his wifes body, but its even worse because he doesn't do CPR right to begin with.I'll be fair, there were good fight scenes. There was a girl-girl fight scene (which lasted about 1 minute) though it was much more entertaining than the WWE girl-girl \"matches\".

    "review/text": "You know those movies from back in the day that you thought were great, but you watch them now and think they are the worst movies ever made? This movie could certainly fit the later, but whether you think it is any good in the first place remains to be seen. The quality of this movie, or lack thereof as the case may be, is evidenced in the filming sequence (you've seen it a 100 times before in every B movie that has come before it) and the dialog (painful) of the opening scene. There is no plot nor dialog to be had in this movie.This movie is about WWE style action and John Cena. Some good points, the death of Angela was a fun scene, as well as John's police car going over the cliff. That sequence was excellent, but of course the 5 minutes that preceded that of the police car getting shot up, was way over the top and beyond belief. I hope they were just making fun of bad action films, but I think they were actually just being one. There are a couple of other so unbelievable scenes that I was actually left feeling the director could care less about the intelligence level of his adult audience.So, I really can not recommend this movie, and thought it bad enough to write a review. If you are a fan of WWE and John Cena and want to see action no more believable as what you might see on Smackdown, you may very well like this movie. There is nothing wrong with that if that is your bag, and the 16 year old WWE fan I took seemed to like it. But if you expect to get more for your money, then I recommend passing on this one.I did want to add a few comments. First, I seem to have hit a nerve with some fans. Sorry. That is my honest review. Don't smack-me-down because I really hated this movie that you may have liked. As I said, it may very well be likable by some people, as it was by the 16 year old I took to see it. Heck, I actually enjoyed Paris Hilton's one hit wonder, but I'm honest enough to know that many people think even less of her then I did of this movie. All the more power to them, as long at they are honest in their review. So give me a break on that please. I did also want to add one thing I liked about this movie, which is at least it was cheaper to take my fiance and her son to see it, then it was to pay for one pay per view smackdown.",

    "review/text": "Some might say, that professional wrestlers are already actors to some extent. WWE Studios is dedicated to expanding the careers of those with acting talent, from the ring to the big screen. As a champion, John Cena brought an imposing physical presence, rugged good looks, and a certain flair for the dramatic, to his wrestling, and music endeavors. The Marine (2006), is a vehicle designed to showcase Cena's talents, and he acquits himself well enough, in his big screen debut, an explosive and exciting, but still rather unremarkable action thriller.Cena is ex-Marine John Triton, discharged from the service for disobeying orders while on a mission in Iraq. Returning stateside, Triton finds civilian life a little rough, and decides to get away from it all for a while, heading into the South Carolina mountains, with his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson, Nip/Tuck).At a roadside gas station, a gang of thieves on the run, ambush a couple of highway patrolmen. With their vehicle damaged, the criminals, led by Rome (Robert Patrick), and his lieutenant Angela (Abigail Bianca), slug John, kidnap Kate, and hit the road in Triton's SUV. Triton gives chase in the patrol car, in what is the action highlight of the first half of the film. The gang is left travelling on foot through the swamp, with Triton on their trail. The group make their way to a safe house. Triton arrives and takes out some of the gang, but Rome sets off and explosion, and makes his escape. Triton again has to dodge a fireball, and after borrowing a police speedboat, finally catches up to Rome. Up until the finish, Cena's fight scenes are fairly routine, but the battle between Cena and Patrick finally generates a few sparks.Although the story is rather simplistic and uncomplicated, The Marine does entertain, and provides the requisite opportunities for John Cena to flex his muscles, and exercise his fledgling acting skills. Robert Patrick (The Unit, Terminator 2) is a known talent, and brings some humor and class to the production, and he has enough physical stature to take on Cena. Kelly Carlson (who should be in more films) and Australian Abigail Bianca, mix it up, in a couple of spirited fights.Working with director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2), the acting potential that is shown here, is more fully realized in Cena's next film, 12 Rounds (2009). Though he is still chasing after a girl, Cena's character is more well rounded, and the film features more of Cena doing his thing, behind the wheel of a vehicle.",

I bought the movie purely because I like looking at Cena, not because I think he can act. There is a lot of male testosterone available, but both the script and performances are flawed. The plot deals with a marine who discovers his wife has been kidnapped by an evil, demented villin, and it's up to this marine to track down his wife's captor and make him pay. TV's \"Nip/Tuck's\" Kelly Carlson plays the wife and Robert Patrick is an OK villin, but it's Cena'a perfomance and presence that make the film. I am sure with the write script Cena could be a huge movie star; he has amazing screen presence, with the looks and body that most actors would die for.The DVD comes with many bonuses including both the theatrical and unrated versions, the featurette called \"The Making of The Marine\", WWE Promotional Features, John Cena Featurettes, and more.",

And then there are people surviving incredible explosions, again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably. They were not only not funny but were very wierd to me.I enjoy watching John Cena in action, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was fun to watch, but this movie just didn't impress me anymore than wrestling does.

I am a bit worried since most women matches seem very boring and well bad wrestling (wwe and wcw). I have seen Lufisto before and she has done a good job in a few matches but then right away we find out she is not competing.Unlucky 13 Staple Gun Death Match - Ann Thraxx vs. Mickie Knuckles- Cool to watch. They kept stapling dollar bills to each other. It was fairly brutal to watch. A few very good spots in the match. Grade B+Thumbtack Death Match - Vanessa Kraven vs. Rachael Putski- This match wasn't bearly as violent. They both looked very sloppy. Some moves where decent, but others looked awful. Grade C4 Corners Of Pain - Amy Lee vs. SeXXXy Eddy- This was more of a comedy match. We did seem some nice moves, and some nice use or light tubes, and barbwire. Grade C+Barbed Wire Madness - Sumie Sakai vs. Mayumi Ozaki- Ozaki destroyed her opponent. Sakai was bleeding buckets! If it was more competitive it would have been even better. Grade BTaipei Death Match - Mickie Knuckles vs. Rachael Putski - Just a brutal match! It was really a great Taipei deathmatch. I was amazed how much they just beat on each other with the glass. Grade A2 out of 3 Log Cabin Lighttubes - SeXXXy Eddy vs. Mayumi Ozaki- Ok match, Eddy didn't pull of too many moves, he just took a beating. Ozaki looks really goo and loves to use a dog collar effectively. Grade B-Barbed Wire, Weapons, Steel Cage Match - Mickie Knuckles vs. Mayumi Ozaki- Solid finish but nothing spectacular. Both competitors where so tired they could don't much. They used a lot of light tubes on each other and we saw the occasional whip into the barbwire. Grade B-Overall this DVD fell well short of the others. This one had less matches, and only reached 2 hours because of a lot of replays. It's a shame this one didn't live up to the other in the series because the others are truly remarkable. Overall Grade B-",

    "review/text": "This movie (the unrated version) has received much praise, from what I have seen. It has been described as &quot;very sexy&quot; by more than one viewer. Well, there are heaps of nude people, for sure. However, the nudity, as it comes across to the viewer, is not sexy. It is rather boring, in fact. True, the women are pretty (with notable exceptions) and they have fine bodies (with notable exceptions) and thus they could, should the script/direction have provided the opportunity, have put on fine performances. Yet they do not. They seem...well, bored. And they &quot;act&quot; as if they have never had sex before: as if this was the first time and they had all their knowledge from adult magazines and hardcore novellas. But I guess that's the fault of the director. And the males? Well, I am sure the director was joking when he decided to trot them onto the screen because never, even in the worst porn films, have I seen a greater collection of un-handsome male &quot;actors.&quot; Gread bodybuilders, no doubt, but man do they have empty faces! What's left? The script: It's a collection of vignettes joined together by a common thread, the lead actress, who appears to have an aversion to frontal nudity. The set: Very cheap. For the most part it looks like a hastily put-together set of a porn movie, not real environment. The camerawork: Flat. Unimaginative. Total aversion to the mixing together of close-ups, medium and wide shots of the same scene. Yet the camera is on a tripod - well, you get the picture. Lighting: Harsh. Coupled with the strong, almost unnatural colors of the set it becomes almost hurtful. Conclusion: Most of us, lovers of the soft core genre, would want to be turned on by a movie. This, however, turns you off. Don't waste your time.",

    "review/text": "I have to say I really enjoyed Femalien. Yes, it's undeniably soft-core porn, but it is absolutely the best movie of this type I have ever seen. The plot isn't anything to brag about, but it does make some sense and holds together quite nicely. Femalien is an alien \"collector\" sent to earth to study human intimacy. Her people have evolved beyond physical bodies to become energy beings, and intimacy has been lost in the process. Femalien is given a \"suitable\" form (I'll say!) that will allow her to pass herself off as a human being and learn all about interpersonal relations by observing humans interacting with one another. She doesn't have to look very far to find subjects for study, and she is a quick learner, engaging in her own interaction experiments before very long.This whole movie just exudes professionalism, from the acting to the camera work to whatever else directors do that makes a film a real treat to watch. You won't find this many attractive women in most films of this type, either. Venesa Taylor in particular is a living doll; hers is a classic beauty that is quite rare these days. She is just completely captivating. She has talent, too, and her naive, innocent manner of speech and appearance just suits her role in this movie to a tee. The sex scenes, even the ones that don't include Venesa Taylor, are also as good as you will find in movies of this genre. Basically, Femalien has it all. Forget about all the disappointments you may have felt when watching other supposedly good movies of this type; Femalien is sure to please. As long as you are aware of this movie's exceedingly erotic nature and don't approach it expecting a thrilling science fiction adventure, there is simply no way you can be disappointed.",

    "review/text": "Femalien is probably among the most famous softcore movies to date, thanks to its undeniably campy premise and graphic sex. I don't know, softcore films usually bore me, but there are exceptions (like The Erotic Witch Project, The Alien Files, Casting Couch) and this is one of them.Part of the reason's got to be the silly sci-fi premise, which is about a female alien (get it, femalien?!) who comes to Earth to observe humans engage in sexual interaction. By that alone, this softcore film has more plot than three average late-night cable flicks combined. So, basically, the movie doesn't consist of much more than 90 minutes of this femalien (played by Venesa Talor), calling herself Kara in a hilariously dumb scene, watching people have sex while getting off on it, even occasionally joining in on the fun. Well, okay, there is the subplot with the chick named Sun (Jacqueline Lovell) who owns a diner that's about to be shut down by a guy who owns a massaging company, but it pretty much exists only as a set-up for Talor and Lovell to get it on.Femalien has a pretty decent sense of humor, which also places it above most films of its kind. Yeah, the jokes are awful, but they have a unique anti-charm that works in its favor (and Venesa Talor is so gosh-darned gorgeous, you can't help but get sucked in by her character's naivete).There are numerous sex scenes in this film, so I'll give a rundown of the highlights. Let's see, there's the photoshoot segment, which is actually probably the film's highlight. Whoever the actress is playing the other part of this coupling during this scene, I'd like to know her name. Simply put, she's hot. The other standouts include Venesa Talor's two love scenes, there's the superior one with the guy in the diner and another very graphic one with Jacqueline Lovell, which is so graphic, I could almost swear they were really going at it. Nice.Performances are mostly really bad, though Venesa Talor, in a campy B-movie way, excels as the hottie alien. It's got to be the naive way she approaches every situation, which isn't too unlike Starman, but come on, she's easier on the eyes than Jeff Bridges. Okay, that's an understatement, considering she's one of the sexiest women I've ever seen. Yeah, she's had work done on her (now very large) breasts, but I for one think they look great and at any rate, are far more of a turn on than the ludicrous basketballs on Shauna O'Brien's chest.Femalien sure isn't a good movie, not by a long shot, but it's an enjoyably silly one that can be easy to take thanks to non-stop sex and nudity. There's also a sequel, but I have yet to see the uncut version of it (which sort of defeats the purpose of watching softcore).[three and a] 1/2 out of [five stars]",

After viewing this movie with my wife (a former Miss South Carolina), she purred, &quot;I've never thought about another woman sexually, until now.&quot; In fact, she has even allowed me to extend an invitation to Vanesa for a night of unbridled passion (I'm still waiting for her to respond.) The scene that did it for my wife was the one with her and Jacqueline Lovell (a real cutey). This scene was as close to XXX as you can get. It should not be missed!

Here's what's important - this flick is pretty much wall to wall skin, some decent pink (no spreads that I remember), and erotic fun.There is a bit of filler to fast forward thru (silly subplot about saving a diner, blah blah). A sexy alien experiencing human lust is enough for plot - I guess these folks can't help themselves.But Femalien has turned me into a real fan of Jacqueline Lovell, the pretty blonde who is actually a good performer who delivers her lines believably, and particularly Venesa Taylor. Venesa will blow you away here - pretty girl-next-door face, dreamy eyes, long legs and amazing double Ds that will have you short of breath. She's so hot, it may take you a couple viewings to make it thru the movie (get my drift). The scenes w/ other performers, including some mid-90s porn stars, are all adequate, but the scenes w/ Jacqueline and/or Venesa are stellar.All & all very good for this type of movie, though I would have liked more pink.",

I did, and I'm glad I did. If you liked the first love scene in \"Mulholland Drive\", you will love this movie. Mostly for the ending scene, but there's a little more to it.Somehow these actors make you forget the ridiculous setups for the sex scenes. It's almost tastefully done. Unlike in hardcore, these people actually look like real people (although much more attractive) when making love. And in spite of the script, they manage to create a little bit of sexual tension.But that's if your trying to follow the \"story\". If you just like to see some really beautiful women (and/or men) getting naked, I can highly recommend this on that subject. As many reviewers have stated, the lead is ravishing. She a little believeable in the role, but who cares: she's super hot! And the others are very nice too-- not a dud in the bunch.So, even though this is another smoothjazz softcore movie, it's not typical. It's very beautiful, and very dumb. In other words, any Heather Graham fans will get it.",

One or two of the guys were hot.Kara has just beamed down from a planet that wants to study human sensations. She's naked in the first scene and for most of the rest of the movie. It starts when she sees her neighbor sun-tanning and wanting her guy to put oil on her so she won't burn. After not alot of coaxing, they start going at it right there in the yard completely naked, in multiple positions. Kara experiments by herself watching them and then gets off while watching people she's 'touched' (she makes them feel really good). She makes some models do it, a guy at a cafe, then two women at a lingerie store get it on just for Kara to watch. They invite her to a kinky party with just women and she gets 'some more experience'. The best part is the end where there are three couples at a meditation center, that Kara touches. She always wants more experience.To sum it up, plot 20% of the movie. Sex scenes 80%. Definitely more guy erotica, but it was good for its purpose. Could've used more guys in it though.

The energy being is given the form of a young woman. What follows are scenes of her spying on couples and her interactions with others. The alien is collecting and cataloging experiences for her race who have risen above physicality but still miss it. During her adventures she tries to help a local woman retain ownership of her diner.While the plot is weak I do recommend this film for those times when a movie like Invasion of the Star Creatures or Galaxina is the sort of thing you are looking for.",

She is given the form of a Beautiful Women. Her visit is to collect data on human interpersonal experiences.Shortly after arrival she goes to a local restaurant, where she meets Sun and Drew. Drew and Sun had been together, but broke up. Drew was instantly attracted to Kara. Sun was a Sci Fi fan who always wanted to meet an Alien.Sun directs Kara to a few experiences that could be enjoyable. Which include an erotic photo shoot, an erotic play, a lingerie store, and a massage pallor.Kara returns to the restaurant throughout the movie. First she seduces Drew. Then learns that Sun is about to loose the restaurant, so Kara decides to help her keep it. She fails to do so, but plays a part in helping Sun make peace with loosing the place.Near the end Sun and Kara attend a meditation group. Kara uses her powers on the whole group. Sun and Kara watch with delight as the meditation group becomes an orgy.After that Kara beams herself and Sun to her bedroom, revealing who and what really is to Sun. Immediately followed by one of the best lesbian scenes ever. Afterwards Kara reveals herself to Drew also.Kara is so overwhelmed by Human sensations that she decides to stay on Earth indefinetly. The movie ends with Kara in the arms of Both Drew and Sun.All that is accompanied by a cast of gorgeous extras, and background music as sensual as the cast. This is indeed one of the best soft core movies..",

I'd imagine a lot of women would like this film. There is a plot, almost, and the sex is penetration-free. It's not just minutes and minutes of pounding. Even the nudity got kind of boring.

Maybe the scene will seem kinky to a really Vanilla person, but hardly anyone else. The actors were so-so. They didn't look bored, but didn't seem to put much into their roles. Most of the acress were agmented and in one case had the profile that comes from a bad job of surgury. The main star had a wonderful face which reminded me of Jennifer Tilly.

While more in the vein of the latter the sci-fi part, {or any other technology for that matter}, is limited to a few teleportations via telekinesis and some aura/emotion melding. The movie is probably 60% by time made of sexual contact. Technically the movie is suprisingly well made for the genera. It is shot on film {not video tape}. The scenery is professionally done and the acting level reaches that of daytime soap operas. The sound quality is not bad.

    "review/text": "On Dec 17, 1903, Orville Wright made history by flying the Kitty Hawk about ten feet above the ground. The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered less than 200 feet. He was moving at a speed of just 7 miles per hour! Within a dozen years or so, technology had proceeded to the point where planes could fly over 100 MPH, with ceilings up to 20,000 feet. Mount a machine gun and voila! You have a new dimension in modern warfare: aerial combat.Flyboys tells the story of a ragtag group of Americans who flew for France in World War I, before the United States officially entered the war. The plot is fairly predictable for this genre, even cliche at points, but the movie still works thanks to some amazing CGI that gives photo realistic images of the aerial combat. The cinematography is well done all around.The acting was passable. The performance of French actress Jennifer Decker was memorable, despite limited screen time.The blu-ray transfer is outstanding--one of the best I have seen. Amazing detail; rich colors; little or no film grain, even in nighttime shots. Because of the gorgeous cinematography and CGI effects, this is a film where you want the best possible clarity, and this blu-ray delivers. The sound is also very good. The battle noises are effective, and the epic soundtrack plays great.Parental Advisory: Flyboys features realistic wartime violence, mild language, drinking (but not drunkenness), and a couple of scenes in a brothel (but very tame by modern standards). Also, a couple kiss in one scene. The PG-13 rating is for the violence. Apart from that, it would have been a mild PG. This is a throwback to an older style of movie making.I recommend this movie. While fairly predictable, it nevertheless has some patriotic spirit and is beautiful to watch. The three-star rating is for the movie. If I were rating the blu-ray transfer only, I would give it a full five stars. If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, do it. You will not be sorry.",

    "review/text": "How can you go wrong with a new BD that costs $8. I've actually seen this at a local outlet for even less. If you have any type of HDTV, a 5.1/7.1 surround sound system, and a love of aviation, you'll enjoy the movie. The transfer is exceptional and the surround sound depth puts your system through its paces.Historical accuracy aside concerning the planes, the movie is more about the people in the squadron than the flying. I generally like to watch a movie first, then watch the special features. Not with this one. Because it is based upon true events, watch the special features first, especially the section that details the history of the squadron and the people in the Lafayette Escadrilles. Reviewers have mentioned that the characters are folks you don't care about. You will care more if you watch the historical section first and learn about the true characters written into the film.Flyboys is definitely a library addition for anyone who collects military movies.",

Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as \"We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates\" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't.

I missed seeing it at the cinemas and having now watched it on DVD, I really wish I had made the effort to have viewed it on the big screen. The scene of French Bi-planes attacking a Zeppelin are awesome, as are all the dog fight scenes of which there are plenty.

Not all German planes were red, not all German planes were Fokker Triplanes (only around 300 made) they had a short run because of manufacturing problems, wings would come apart in a dive. The real airplanes of that time could not do half of the aerobatics that they show in the movie, they also would self destruct from G forces. They were mainly wood and fabric. They had 2 lions (whiskey & soda) not just one. There was a black pilot, but he came in late in the war and only had 1 and possibly 2 confirmed kills. I am now waiting for the new movie \"The Red Baron\" that was made in Germany and will be released on May 10th in Europe. It at least looks very accurate compared to the garbage that they put into The Flyboys. The movie is fair, but I would not go out of my way to purchase it if I new of all the historical mistakes in it. The producers even state they changed a lot of facts so that the average person would find it entertaining and not get confused at who was the bad guys. (Germans in red airplanes, \"Red Baron\")",

To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars.

Gazing at his victim before he blew him to pieces. Then suddenly he grabbed his pilot's pistol and bam....he shot the enemy sending him in a straight plummet to earth. Kaboom.The movie Flyboys really caught my attention with all the flashy highflying action. To tell you the truth...it was just as cool as the commercials said it would be.I really enjoy how they incorporated all of the action and flying into a real story, not just flair and special effects like Star Wars I, The Phantom Menace. You really got to see the life of a soldier and his comrades in World War I.I think that this film didn't do a good job of introducing the character's names. Even though this movie did have each character developing his own likes or dislikes, and even characteristics. You could not put a name to a face. At the end of the movie you still didn't feel like you related to any of the characters like a good movie should.Flyboys did do a nice job of having a great ending. So it made you forget about all of the faults in the movie. That is why I am struggling to give negative feedback (If you do want to find things you do not like in the movie just watch up until the last 15 minutes and then cut the television off).Any great war movie has to have a hero. The main pilot (I forgot his name) during the war, had a relationship with one of the French girls. In the war, the Germanscome to her house. He flies all night to get to her and then he finds her and saves her. The movie did this very well. What more can you ask for in a movie but violence, flight, war movie, storyline, special affects, and romance for all you grownups out their. I loved this movie.I would most certainly recommend this movie to any person that is willing to pay a few dollars to see one of the best movies of the year.",

I mean come on, James Franco's character chases after some french woman who doesnt even know english. What im trying to say is that it wasnt a good idea to put a love story in a war movie. There was only 3 good five minute action scenes that werent really that violent. When i saw the commercial to this movie i said oh boy another war movie to see, but when i finally saw it it absolutely lacked the violence from Saving Private Ryan and Enemy At The Gates. I was Pissed that I wasted my time watching some dumb, so called \"War Movie\" that didnt even have enough violence to fullfill me or my dad. After the movie my dad just said Kyle, thats the dumbest peice of crap of a \"War\" movie i ever saw. So im just telling you this would be a good starters movie for children because the worst of the violence is only one scene when James Franco shoots the Nazi sumbich in the head. And get this, at that specific part theres not even that much blood! So i hope now that if you war movie fans saw this and rated this against Saving Private it would get a 1 out of 10.

    "review/text": "\"Flyboys\" is amazing. It manages to be a dull movie about a fascinating subject, the Lafayette Escadrille, a dull love story, and a dull movie about Great War dog fighting, which this reviewer did not believe possible.Although the film is trying and makes an effort at historical detail and dramatic content it falls flat. The viewer doesn't get chance to know any of the characters ably played by some new faces as well as the venerable Jean Reno. (Reno must have a bell that rings in his agent's office every time an American script calls for a French character.) But no amount of acting can pull this lack luster script from the trenches of tedium.The missing piece in \"Flyboys,\" other than the absence of Von Richthofen, is the near complete lack of any actual aerial photography. \"Top Gun\" is a mediocre film at best but has phenomenal aerial photography which is exciting and engaging. In \"Flyboys\" we have only CGI which is sterile. The performers don't have close ups of their faces against sub-zero wind (for which they are woefully underdressed) which detracts from the danger and excitement of a film about Great War pilots. It is obvious they are against a green screen in Vancouver. If \"Flyboys\" had gone the extra mile and had at least one dog fight done for \"real\" it would have saved the film. Granted, there aren't may flying bi and tri planes in the world but if massive trebuchets can be built for \"Kingdom of Heaven,\" and Fort William Henry can be rebuilt for \"Last of the Mohicans,\" and fiberglass tanks can be built for \"A Bridge Too Far,\" and a working Tiger can be found for \"Saving Pvt. Ryan,\" then I'm sure the producers of this film could have found a way to bring some excitement to \"Flyboys.\"However \"Flyboys\" will be a boon to sleep researchers who now have a new way to put test subjects to sleep without the side effects of narcotics or entertainment value",

As for it being 'based on a true story,' the only things 'true' about it could be counted on one hand. Yes, there WAS a Lafayette Escadrille; yes, they DID have a lion as a mascot named 'Whiskey;' yes, there WAS a black pilot in the squadron; yes, Vanderbilt DID rent a chateau for them to use as a barracks, and yes, they did fly Nieuports for a while. As for the rest of the story, it is either rubbish, or was composed of a number of incidents actually attributable to a large number of pilots from other squadrons. But even that didn't bother me so much as the PLANES used in this movie! I can't understand it! They got so many of the other details correct (motorcycles, the aerodrome, cars, etc, etc.), how could they screw up the planes so badly, when almost all of them and almost all of the flying scenes were CG?? Is there ANYONE who does not know that the famous Red Baron Von Richtofen was the ONLY German to fly an all-red triplane? As far as I am aware, he was the ONLY German to fly an all-red airplane, period. So why are there entire squadrons of all-red triplanes flying around in this movie? This is an idiotic mistake that could only have happened because the stupid CG animators simply copied the red triplanes out of some stupid video game (probably along with the rest of the planes as well). Blue, green, yellow, checkerboard, just about any OTHER color or color combination could have worked! Also, why did the two-seater (called a Sopwith 1 1/2 strutter, for those that care) not have FRENCH markings, since it belonged to the squadron as their training plane (it was in British markings throughout the movie)? As this was a real aircraft (along with one of the Nieuports, an SE-5, a Bristol, and perhaps one of the Fokker Triplanes, the rest were all CG), my guess is the real owners didn't want their nice British paint job screwed up, but the CG animators could easily have made the changes after filming. Continuity!! And considering the film-makers were in close contact with all the owners and fliers of the real aircraft, all of whom may be considered experts on WW1 aircraft and markings, why is it none of these issues were ever dealt with? All of these things were acceptable when WW1 flying movies were filmed in the '20's and 30's, because the technology was simply not available to make the movies truly accurate. And I know there are a lot of people out there that think I am being too fussy, but dammit! Think about the movie 'Top Gun,' and imagine it filmed with Cessnas instead of F14's, and perhaps you might get the idea. Looks like we will all just have to wait for the 'perfect' WW1 flying movie. In the meantime, I recommend you watch 'The Blue Max' for some real flying with real planes on film...",

Clocking in at over two hours it is a bit too long and some of the dialogue is lacking, but the romance is handled well (unlike Pearl Harbor, thank God!), as are the many amazing CGI dogfight scenes. If your bored one afternoon, you should check out Flyboys, otherwise just wait for the DVD.",

    "review/text": "I have been looking forward to seeing this movie but became reluctant after reading the rather mediocre reviews it received from the so-called \"experts\". I decided to ahead and, as usual, the \"experts\" got it all wrong. FLYBOYS not only met my expectations, but also exceeded them.I'm a big history buff and am usually very disappointed with Hollywood's rendition of historical events. For me, it really detracts from a movie when I see things like Sea Sparrow missile launchers on the deck of a destroyer in Pearl Harbor, or when William Wallace supposedly has a torrid affair with a Princess who was, in reality, only three years old at the time of his death, and I expected to find similar fault with this movie. I found no such errors here. The true life story was most accurate, including such details as the lion which served as the mascot for the Escadrille LaFayette, the dented bullets which the flying aces had to sort through before each flight, and the fact that over one million allied soldiers lost their lives at Verdun.Hollywood movie critics have a difficult time with true stories. True life, especially when accurately presented, doesn't always have the same flair as fictionalized accounts, and critics have given rather harsh reviews of the plot, totally missing so many details surrounding such things as camaraderie, respect and traumatic real life emotions. And no, in real life, people don't always live happily ever after and the hero doesn't always ride off into the sunset with his sweetheart.Beyond the historical accuracy portrayed here, the film has sensational filming, particularly in the air battle scenes. The aerial views depict the miles of devastation of French countryside surrounding the trenches. The casting is more than adequate with particular mention going to Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault. James Franco also gives a superb portrayal of American Ace Blaine Rawlings.If you are a history lover, and particularly interested, as I am, in the Great War, I urge you to go and watch this movie. You will find it historically accurate and yet able to bridge the gap into being an entertaining movie. Remember that this is not some Hollywood enhanced idea of war, but rather an accurate depiction of the real life events that surrounded the American pilots who became the Escadrille LaFayette. The critics got this one all wrong. Surprise, surprise.Monty Raineywww.juntosociety.com",

    "review/summary": "Pretty good WWI aerial drama",
    "review/text": "Flyboys didn't last long in theaters upon its release, but don't let that scare you away, it's an above average WWI period drama. During World War I, a group of American pilots joined the fighting in Europe before the United States entered the war in 1918. Flying for the French, they were named the Lafayette Escadrille. The movie follows five or six freshly arrived pilots, most notably James Franco as Texan Blaine Rawlings, as they train and learn how to fly and ultimately join the war as they take on German fighters, most notably the Black Falcon, a German pilot who doesn't follow the \"rules of war.\" All in all, this was a pretty good movie. It's by no means a great movie, but it kept me entertained for the full 140 minute running time. The added love story isn't as bad as I thought it'd be, but the movie didn't need that storyline. It would have been better if the storyline focused primarily on the pilots and the dogfights, which are the high points of the movie. Go see this movie for the dogfights, especially the zeppelin attack on Paris and the final showdown between Rawlings and the Black Falcon!One of the complaints of the movie was that it is too cliched, and this is partly true, but for me it felt like the actors did the best they could with what they have. James Franco gets top billing as Texan Blaine Rawlings, a young rancher who joins the war after his ranch went under. Along with flying with the Escadrille, he falls in love with a French girl, Lucien (French beauty Jennifer Decker), who can't speak English. My favorite character is Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson), the veteran pilot who slowly opens up to the new pilots. The rest of the young pilots who arrive with Rawlings include Phillip Winchester as William Jensen, the golden boy who knows he'll become a hero, Tyler Labine as Briggs Lowry, a young man from a rich family who is trying to prove himself to his father, Abdul Salis as Eugene Skinner, the lone African-American pilot in the group who must prove himself while also dealing with some racism, and David Ellison as Eddie Beagle, the struggling pilot who may or may not have a suspicious background. Jean Reno is excellent in a small part as the captain of the squadron, Capt. Thenault, but it's too bad he couldn't have been used more.The soon to be released two-disc DVD, Jan. 30, 2007, will offer a boatload of special features which I'm definitely looking forward to watching. There will be several making of featurettes, some history about the real Lafayette Escadrille, an audio commentary with director Tony Bill and producer Dean Devlin, deleted scenes, trailers, and a Flyboys Squadron DVD-rom game. So for a movie with some excellent dogfights and aerial sequences, a pretty good ensemble cast, and a not so bad love story, look for the two-disc DVD of Flyboys in January!",

    "review/summary": "Historically accurate?",
    "review/text": "Flyboys is a decent adventure film, but with apologies to reviewer Monty Rainey, it can hardly be praised for its historical accuracy. The computer-generated planes zip around more like jet fighters than WW1 planes, making snap-rolls & vertical climbs rather than Immelman turns & the slower, more gradual maneuvers the real planes were capable of. The Nieuports the Escadrille fly were obsolete & replaced by Spads by late 1916/early 1917 (when the movie takes place--they mention the USA entering the war which was April, 1917), and the Fokker Triplane didn't enter service until the winter of 1917 & never in great numbers (very few were red by the way). These quibbles aside, what really destroys the believabilty of the movie is when one of the Flyboys gets shot down & crashes in no-man's land (at a point where the German & French lines seem to be about 50 yards apart when a half mile is about the closest they ever actually got). Though he's in the cockpit when it crashes, the pilot somehow gets his hand trapped between the ground & the upper wing (which miraculously didn't collapse when the plane flipped upside down). And he can't get it out! His friend has to land (apparently also in no-man's land), run THRU no-man's land perpendicular to all the Germans shooting at him, & help his friend get his hand out. (I won't spoil it by saying how.) WW1 fighters weighed roughly 1000 lbs, with the engine & guns comprising over half the total weight. The top wing his hand was trapped under would have weighed about 100 lbs total. If your hand was trapped under one side, you'd simply lift it off with your free hand. Also the trailing edge of the Nieuport was made up of a pine-wood stringer which was one inch square. He could have cut your way thru it with a penknife. OR, since his hand was trapped between the wing & the GROUND, he could have simply dug the earth away underneath it.Other blatant inaccuracies: the Germans invade with tanks of British design a year before the tank was invented; they've made a massive breakthrough within a few miles of the airfield & the pilots (& the hero's French girlfriend living in the war zone) are completely unaware of it; the hero takes off at night, lands (where? in a field, in the dark?) by his girl friend's house, & none of the thousands of German soldiers in the area hear the plane. . .For all that, it's not a bad action movie, but as far as being realistic? They should have just made the movie about the real Escadrille pilots. Raoul Lufbery's true exploits would have been much more exciting. (To anyone interested in the true story of the Escadrille, I heartily recommend Jeff Shaara's novel about WW1, TO THE LAST MAN. And for a movie that gets to the heart of what flying in WW1 was really like, try THE DAWN PATROL with Errol Flynn (coming out in March on dvd).",

    "review/summary": "Can you spot the real actors in this movie?",
    "review/text": "The real actors?Well, there's poor James Franco, a fine young actor, who must be cursing his bad luck in getting to play the leading man only in movies plagued by rotten screenplays and supporting casts, and also in losing the leading man role (and then having to play second fiddle) to some wimp in that blockbuster series of all time, Spider-man...And then there's Jean Reno, Hollywood's favorite token Frenchman (even though he was born in Morocco to Spanish parents, as Juan Moreno), once again playing the earnest, understanding wise man with the funny French accent........ gosh, if only all French people could be just like him! ......especially those nasty waiters and shopkeepers in Paris, and those anti-American French politicians......This movie had so many clich&eacute;d scenes in it that I began to realize that the filmmakers must have thought that they could get away with it because the younger movie-going generation wouldn't recognize these as clich&eacute;s, since most are from an older generation of movies. It must save money to just recycle the old classic scenes, instead of hiring better, more original screenwriters.There's the obligatory sendoff at the train station with the girlfriend running alongside the train (I winced during this scene, half expecting the girl to run splat into a signpost.........ooops, wrong movie, that was from one of the \"Hot Shots\" series); the obligatory first fight at the bar amongst the airmen; the obligatory hero's death with kamikaze swan dive into the mission target; the obligatory hero saves girl - hero loses girl plot; the obligatory devout Christian, who might as well have also been carrying a sign saying \"I'LL BE DEAD MEAT SOON\" along with his Bible.So what about the non-actors?Chief among them has to be David Ellison, son of billionaire Larry Ellison of Oracle Software. Daddy helped finance a good chunk of the $60 million budget of this movie which meant that, despite a complete lack of any acting ability, on a scale similar to the fiasco that was Jake Lloyd (little Anakin - Stars Wars, Phantom Menace), and despite an intensely annoying screen presence equivalent to that of Jar Jar Binks from that same movie, David Ellison gets huge amounts of screen time, including a constant series of brief cutaway shots focused on him, designed to subliminally remind the viewer that he's in this movie........OOOOOFFTA........can you spell N-A-R-C-I-S-S-I-S-T ?Another near non-actor, Jennifer Decker - the girl who plays James Franco's love interest Lucienne. OK, she's sort of cute, but who told her that the way to play a French girl who doesn't speak English is to act like a deaf-mute? How the heck did SHE get this role? We used to come to the answer to that question quite easily, but unfortunately, it is no longer politically correct to say such things in public.Historically, a number of things are not quite right. The Nieuport 17s that the airmen are supposedly flying had rotary engines, not the radial engines depicted. NONE of the fighters of WWI had radial engines in fact, since air cooling technology had not developed fully to allow for fixed cylinder heads (in the rotary engines, the cylinder heads of the engine spun around together with the propeller, thus providing superior air cooling). In any case, the Lafayette Escadrille would quickly lose the Nieuport 17s and mostly fly SPADs (which had inline engines) for much of the war.And those bullet holes! Come on! The planes were made of fabric and wood, and had absolutely NO ARMOR! If bullets hit all around the cockpit, the pilot is DEAD! How the heck could James Franco's plane be so riddled with bullets in that last dogfight, and he only gets hit ONCE!?That's just my two bits on the historical inaccuracies - there are a great many in this movie which have been pointed out by other reviewers already.However, in spite of all its flaws, this was a moderately entertaining movie. I watched it as a $2 rental, on my 23\" widescreen computer monitor, so that I could surf the Internet whenever the movie got too inane. It's the only way to watch this movie, as far as I'm concerned. Whenever Jar Jar..., I mean, David Ellison,... appeared onscreen, I would Google something about him or his billionaire father - these multi-tasking distractions helped to get me through those scenes, and reminded me also that money has its privileges.I give the movie one star for James Franco's earnest performance, one star for the CGI flying sequences, and one star for trying to tell some of the history of WWI, even if the details got mangled",

    "review/text": "I have just had an interesting time perusing the 101 previous reviews. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me there's a wide range of opinion out there. How often do we find headlines running from one-starred \"Save your money\" to three-starred \"Good enough\" to five-starred \"Best movie of 2006 - also best kept secret\"? And all three comments in consecutive reviews on a single Amazon \"page\"?[For the enlightenment of any cynics out there, I read the reviews and the attached comments as well as the headlines.]The main objection to \"Flyboys\" seemed to arise from the innumerable errors found on the screen. They ranged from the airplanes that did not exist at the time of the film, to the super-abundance of Red Barons infesting the skies above France, to the breathtaking indifference to the laws of physics, to the positively giddy misapprehensions about what actually took place in the First World War (aka The Great War aka The War to End All Wars ... ahem.) Now you may think that these historical boners, these intellectual clunkers are characteristic of video game-addled, Star Wars-bedazzled, comic book-educated lunkheads and lamebrains rather than of responsible adults given control over the millions and millions of dollars required to make a motion picture--but I say to err is human and to provide reason for selling all that overpriced popcorn is near-divine (at least for the theater owners.)A smaller group of naysayers held forth that the plot of the movie made no sense and that the people on the screen masquerading as actors displayed no slightest hint of talent. I heartily dispute the latter. The always excellent Jean Reno, who portrayed the French commandant of the flyboy squadron, was right up there on the screen to show what a competent actor looks like. For several minutes, at least.Enough negativity. Most reviewers clearly loved this picture. Many of them took up such stirring war cries as, \"Never listen to the CRITICS! This is one of the BEST!!!!\", \"Never mind the critics\" and \"The critics don't get it,\"--not to mention the immortal, \"Don't listen to the `experts.'\" And the reasons they gave to turn off your mind and just drool in your seat were ... uh, and .... Oh, yes, here's one, and by far the best of the bunch: \"I took my 4-year old to see it, and he loved it.\" Yes! Absolutely!! Take that you hyper-critical snobs!!!As for myself , I shall venture just one small criticism: not one minute, not one second, not one frame of the flying sequences looked convincing. \"Flyboys\" is the most compelling argument I have ever seen against using CGI on a motion picture screen. \"Cheesy,\" \"unreal\" and unintentionally hilarious\" don't even come close to expressing the way I feel about this visual train wreck.Take the vaunted Zeppelin sequence: the animation in \"Wallace and Grommet\" was more convincing. Much more. Now look at the Zeppelin sequence in Howard Hughes' 1930 blockbuster, \"Hell's Angels.\" Both are special effects sequences. The 21st century version just lies down and dies, leaving a bad taste in your mouth. Its 76 year-old predecessor (in color, mind you!) pins you back in your seat. When the Zep crashes, if I hadn't known the date of \"Hell's Angels\" I'd have believed that Hughes had intercut some lost color film of the Hindenberg tragedy.DVD STUFF: In my journey through the earlier reviews, I noticed that some critics looked askance at comments addressed solely to the film and not to the DVD. With that in mind I hasten to inform everyone that \"Flyboys\" appears on one or more plastic disks, and that in some editions it is accompanied by other stuff of no discernible significance.A FINAL WISTFUL THOUGHT: Wouldn't it be nice if somebody, somewhere, someday made a movie about the Lafayette Escadrille?",

    "review/summary": "'Flyboys' is an impressive achievement",
    "review/text": "Where does one start when reviewing a movie like \"Flyboys\"? Does one discuss the attention to historical detail? The facts behind the real-life Lafayette Escadrille? The surprisingly great acting from a cast largely comprised of unknowns? The amazing flying sequences and special effects?Really, the movie \"Flyboys\" is a monumental achievement and an effort of which everyone involved in it can take pride.Prior to the United States entry into World War I a number of American men traveled to Europe lured by a fascination with the relatively new ability to fly (many people had never seen an airplane at this time). They joined a squadron known as the Lafayette Escadrille (named after the French general who aided America during the Revolutionary War).Airflight was incredibly dangerous at this time and even more so when flying into a combat zone. Aerial dog-fighting was also a close quarters affair with mere feet between opposing pilots. Indeed the life expectancy for WWI pilots was also extremely short. As one character comments of another's hard edged nature \"Bet he doesn't make friends easily.\" The always excellent Jean Reno interjects with \"All of his friends are dead!\"So into this backdrop comes \"Flyboys\" which follows the stories of a group of mismatched new arrivals to the squadron. We have, among others, a Texas rancher faced with the repossession of his land, a young aristocrat seeking the approval of his father, an African American prize fighter eager to repay the kindness shown to him by the French and a young man seeking to follow in his families military heritage.Together they forge a friendship and from stumbling beginnings an effective fighting force.It's an engaging drama and one that I have already ewatched three times. It is nicely complemented on this DVD release by an impressive number of special features the prize of which, for me at least, is the documentary on the inspirations for the characters and historical research and a second one on the real-life Lafayette Escadrille. There is of course a very engaging commentary track which also highlights the great amount of detail that went into the making of the movie.When it was released the movie was criticized by some rather ignorant reviewers who railed against some of the details in the movie. They complained for example about the gunman atop a zeppelin shooting at the fighters buzzing around him. This, however, as the producer Dean Devlin explains, was based on historical fact when Devlin came across a picture of one such gunman in a history book of WWI.Yes, \"Flyboys\" is an impressive achievement and well worth your time and money.",

    "review/summary": "STRANGE HISTORY",
    "review/text": "This is an awfully good looking movie put together by some very gifted veteran film makers. Unfortunately, it seems not to have occurred to any of them to consult even a rudimentary history of World War I before embarking on this.\"Flyboys\" is supposedly set against the backdrop of that war but in fact it is not. It takes place in an alternate universe where things are very different.Okay, a good movie has dramatic needs. But usually its fictions are things that \"could have happened\" within the context of a larger historical backdrop. Consider...(1) The actual war opened with a German drive on Paris in 1914 which stalled out at the Marne. Both sides dug in there, and each extended their flanks until parallel trench lines ran uninterrupted for 475 miles from the Swiss border to the sea. And there they sat...This was the notorious \"trench deadlock\" that gripped the western front from late 1914 through early 1918. The film supposedly takes place during this period but...(2) \"Flyboys\" forgets the trenches and strangely posits an imaginary German drive on Paris around 1916. Airmen of the Escadrille try to thwart it by escorting bombers to attack German supply depots. What is even more odd is that when this raid fails, they simply lose interest in the threat to Paris and turn to other missions.(3) The only major German offensive in this period was actually at Verdun. It was a bloody struggle that lasted months and accomplished little, but cost over a million lives. The Escadrille is based at Verdun in the movie so its airmen should be in the middle of this crisis. Yet they seem blissfully unaware something is amiss.(4) There is mention of \"sending children to England\" for safety. A touching cinematic moment, but there was no need to flee France in World War I. If necessary, you simply moved farther away from the front.(5) Around mid-film the surprising announcement is made that \"the Germans have moved across the Meuse\" -- and indeed we see soldiers marching across open fields.But again, as with the drive on Paris, how did these troops get past the Allied trenches?A massive breech of the Allied line would be needed, with follow up forces penetrating deep into open country in the rear. Such a staggering event would have shaken France to the core.But here it merely provides the hero an opportunity to fly to the rescue of his sweetheart and evacuate her by air to safety. After that bit of personal drama the film once again simply loses interest in the situation.(6) The Zeppelin daylight suicide raid on Paris seems like another fanciful concoction. Zeppelins raided England at night but were never very effective. Here we are given a lovely cinematic death ride that makes no sense.(7) Toward the end of the film the Germans renew that strange drive on Paris. This time it triggers an evacuation of the French capital, apparently to create a poignant background against which the romance between the airman and French girl plays out.Germany was incapable of such an attempt until the collapse of Russia in 1917, which allowed transfer of a million troops from the east. Then came the great German offensives of 1918, but none were aimed at Paris and there was no evacuation.Bottom line:\"Flyboys\" routinely destroys any remote possibility of understanding this important event by huge and impossible distortions made for the most casual and fleeting of purposes. There is more than enough exceptional material in the history of this war to meet any dramatic requirements of film makers. They seem not to have bothered to even look at it.It is strange to see young student reviewers call this film \"a good way to learn about WW I.\"Look, I'm no historian. These remarks are from memory based on having read a few books on this war some years back. That's not much, but it was enough to bedevil sincere efforts on my part to get some sort of handle on the peculiar world of \"Flyboys.\"I very much wanted to like this movie but fear it is a pleasure reserved for those who know little about its subject matter.",

    "review/text": "How is it that Hollywood can take a naturally exciting real-life story, and ruin it? Such it is with Flyboys. Young American fighter pilots learning to fly and fighting for France in WWI before America joined the war - stuff of legends and a bottomless pit of real-life action adventure. All you have to do is tell the story with some reasonable acting, fly a few dogfights and a movie practically makes itself, right? After all, the movie is based on truth (inspired by...). But Hollywood has to push the Mission Implausible limits and add their own twists to the story that turn the average viewer with a brain into a head-shaking critic of their check on the realms of reality. The only thing unpredictable about this movie was the extent of implausibility they sometimes went to.Case in point - and take note this is a spoiler for one chapter of the story but this sums up the comic-book nature they pushed with this movie: A pilot gets shot down and crash-lands in the rugged and inhospitable small strip of no-man's land between the French and German sides who are actively shooting at each other. The hero of the story flies down low to check out his wingman (somehow avoiding getting shot down by the German ground troops himself). He sees the plane has flipped over and that his friend is trapped underneath. Next thing you know, the hero has landed his own plane (somewhere?) and is running between the flying bullets to rescue his wingman. Turns out the wingman's hand is trapped under the trailing edge of his plane's wing. The suspended reality keeps getting deeper as the intrepid rescuer (even with the help of a heroic French soldier) can not move the fragile aircraft (the tail of which one could easily lift with one hand - trust me I know). The hero, amid a hail of bullets, finds a trenching shovel and instead of breaking the fragile wood and fabric wing trapping his wingman's hand, he - well, you can probably guess the amazing bit of surgery he performs... So you get the idea.To be fair, if that kind of reality suspension doesn't bother you in a movie that is not meant to be likened to The Matrix, then you might enjoy it. The flight physics of the dogfights is actually depicted rather well (considering it's done by Hollywood) though it goes far beyond the performance capability of the planes at the time. There is not much real flying going on and the use of computer generated graphics is rather evident. I am an experienced fighter pilot and somewhat enjoyed the dogfights. Too bad they couldn't follow history enough to use the correct planes for the timeframe of the war but that's typical for Hollywood (and allows you to keep track of the good guys and bad guys more easily). The acting is not stellar but carries the story OK. The required French-girl love interest is attractive and believable.This movie could have done quite well if only they had put a check on their typical Hollywood push to go over the edge in action and suspense, thereby losing credibility and the viewer in the process.",

This movie was a great introduction to the role airplanes had in the first World War. Featuring the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, and the role Americans had in the early aerial engagements. The story also allows those who have little knowledge about early technology to understand that it was very rudimentary. (Using hammers to clear your machine gun comes to mind.) The soundtrack was very well done, and the needed animation(?) was excellent as well. I highly recommend this movie.",

    "review/text": "Not only did this movie have great special effects, the effects were used to enhance the story and didn't take away from the movie. The aerial combat scenes were the most realistic and exciting one I had ever seen.The combat in this movie show what real air combat is like, especially in the World War I era, and what these amazing (now primitive) machines could do.A lot of reviewers missed the accuracy of the aerial combat in this movie. Yes, it was \"slow\" but instead of \"Making it into an exciting Hollywood fight or combat scene\" the producers of this movie allowed what actually would take place to stand on it's own.I am glad that there are Hollywood directors and producers who care about historical accuracy and won't sell out to make something that is already breath taking and exciting, over improvised and over done with the standard Hollywood effects and making it look good.My only criticism of this movie is that it was long in certain parts and some of the characterization could have been shortened.This movie gets 4 stars because of the historical accuracy and for not turning into another \"What can we do with out fancy Hollywood Special Effects?\" It also gets the stars for the excellent backstory of the heroes involved. True, it's not as exciting as other Hollywood movies, but then again most lives of heroes aren't that exciting. Most heroes are just in the right place at the right time not setting out to make a difference.",

    "review/text": "I'm a big WW1 buff and really looked forward to this movie.Purported to be the real tale of the Lafeyette Escardrille, Americans who flew for France before 1917, it is only a disservice to those men. To look at it is very pretty and if you can overlook some flawed images, like all the Fokker triplanes being pained red, it looks good.Unfortuneatly this is where the good points end. Even without getting into the historical flaws the film rapidly become predictable, painfully so. You know who will die and can almost predict when and how an hour a head of time. A pointless love story with a french peasant is supposed to add an emotional touch but anyone familiar with a good war film knows this isn't needed. A crash in no man's land results in the feared German Army comming off more like the gang that couldn't shoot straight than the ravening Huns.The French officer is well done, but the actor can hardly turn in a bad performance even when playing opposite a CGI fire breathing lizard. The film even misses it's chance at the \"Eat drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die\" out look that developed among the real pilots on both sides as they realized the mortality rate would probably claim them long before the war ended. This was something touched on far better by the David Niven, Errol Flynn film \"Dawn Patrol.\"Ultimately what I hated about this was not the historically flawed plot, I love Errol Flynn's films, but the unforgivably predictable altitude this falls to, all to fast.Get a parachute and save yourself.",

Acting was great, especially the French girl, and the French Captain Thenault (only member using his real name). Pilots were actually required to join the French Foreign Legion first, but it's another minor point for the story (stories). Several stories going on and I enjoyed them all. Reviewers fault he film for using many military clich&eacute;s, but WWI and that period was a war of clich&eacute;s and I feel it only reinforces the navet&eacute; of the times. The music is probably the only part that is too dramatic, too often, sort of like Star Wars, but it isn't that objectionable till close to the end and for most scenes it adds the right feeling.

    "review/text": "Here is a story about some of the very first military aviators the world has ever seen. While hot air balloons were used during the Civil War to survey battlefields, WWI was the first conflict in which military aviation made a huge impact on the outcome.Long before flight simulators, ejection seats and pilot training schools (which take years & years to complete), the world saw pilots who flew by the seat-of-their pants and took just a few months to become qualified to take to the skies. They used incredibly primitive flight simulators to learn what they could on the ground, and there was little rm to develop bad habits as they were pushed straight into conflict as soon as they were able to control their aircraft.James Franco is an up & coming actor who has his chance as a sort Errol Flynn role, and he pulls it off nicely. His character is a Texan who finds himself @ the end of his rope. So, he sets off for France during WWI and becomes a fighter pilot. Along the way, he meets up with several other Americans doing the same thing. While they may have fudged some details, all of the major characters in the film depict historical people.It's unfortunate that this movie didn't do all that great at the box office. World War One doesn't generate a lot of interest these days, and that's a shame. Up until WWII, it was the most important war the world had ever seen. Sadly, its mantra as the \"War to end all wars\" has long since become an obsolete concept. Nevertheless, it is a vitally important war for us to understand as its a war our great grandparents fought in. While the FX of this film are quite impressive, the main reason you should pick this DVD up is simply because it's history on the screen. It's your history, and it's my history.",

It is based on real events, namely \"the Lafayette Escadrille,\" the squadron formed largely by American volunteers who joined in the French Air Service before America entered the war. This is an intriguing episode that should be remembered, and \"Flyboys\" lives up to our expectations as far as its great aerial sequences are concerned.James Franco (\"Spider-Man\") appears as Blaine Rawlings, Texan rancher who becomes one of the American volunteers after seeing a news reel in theater (and punching a banker off-screen). It's not a bad start, but still his character could have been more three dimensional with a better script and direction. Actually, he and other members of the Lafayette Escadrill are not given many chances to shine, especially on the ground.In fact, the back stories of the volunteers sometimes look clich&eacute;d and Blaine's sub-plot involving a French farm girl drags a bit. Jean Reno plays a French captain who has to train the new recruits patiently, but like \"The Da Vinci Code,\" somehow the director missed the opportunity to use Reno's unique persona effectively.Still, all these flaws would be forgotten once the film starts showing the dogfights, which, I think, are mostly done with CGIs, but still impressive and thrilling. The great flying sequences would bring us back to the day of good, old-fashioned action films.",

It's rare but sometimes the film is even better than I anticipated....and that's the case here.This is a beautifully-photographed, classy film with interesting characters, excellent action scenes in the air with the World War I bi-planes and tri-planes, and a subtle and sweetly-told romance. In other words, this film had a lot to like. Acting-wise, everyone was good. I wasn't familiar with any of these people except for veteran Frenchman Jean Reno, who played \"Captain Thenault\", the main instructor and head of the Lafayette Escadrille. He was excellent, as usual, and played a likable character.The aerial-battle scenes might be the best-ever shown on film but with today's ever-improving cameras, techniques, special-effects with computer knowledge, it's no surprise the flying scenes looked so good. (Think what we'll see on screen in 10 years!) The fight scenes are not overdone, either.Most of the movie centers more on the drama and romantic side than that of action. The romance only involves one of the fliers and it's nicely, tastefully done...and very touching. The actress who plays the part, Jennifer Decker (\"Lucienne\"), is just beautiful and a wholesome-looking lady. You can see why the flier \"Blaine Rawlings (James Frano) fell for her right away, even though neither could speak the other's language.Anyway, the main story is all about all the fighters and some of the missions they flew. This is based on fact and that means it's not always a happy ending for everyone. In some respects, World War I might be the most brutal war ever fought.Overall, this a nice, old-fashioned epic-type story told without much profanity so I would it would suitable for most of the family.",

It's a good thing that the movie remained a War Movie, not a Love Story.Here are a few historical inaccuracies. The tri-planes were not common in 1916. They were really hard to manipulate. But I understand that the director put them in the film for extra visual stimulation, because they do look menacing. Also, I find it hard to believe that the American pilots gained such control over their planes in such a short period of time.

I could relate to the characters and each of their internal conflicts that they were battling.Definitely worth the time to watch and I'm still considering keeping this film to watch again.",

The film has some of the best aerial shots I have ever seen and the machine gun fire (and also the damage it causes) is so realistic! There is also a tender love story between an American pilot and a French girl which also adds merit to the film and is used as a counter-weight to the brutality of the air war. Very good film and surely a must for aviation fans.",

Surounded by French speakers and he didn't pick up more than a few phrases of French? He joined a French military unit, wouldn't he be rather motivated to learn the language?

    "review/text": "MOVIE: Flyboys is a strange thing to dissect. It's a movie you really want to like, but you just can't help but face the fact that it's so cliched and poorly written. The story is centered around Blaine Rawlings, a young man who leaves his past to go fly planes in France. Each of the young men has a story behind them. Some do it for glory, some because they are forced to, some trying to make better lives for themselves, or some escaping their troubles. The film tells the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, a fleet of young Americans who flew planes for the French in WWI before the U.S entered the war. The entire film is schmaltzy with some lame dialogue and weak acting, but it's entertaining. The dogfights, even though the CGI seems unpolished, are quick paced and really great. The story does a good job of building the characters, but since the characters are very flat we really don't care when they get shot down and die. Every formulaic cliche is followed and the movie itself can be followed like a map, there is no surprise as to where it builds and leads to. The audience can pretty much stay one step ahead of the characters, and that is due to the poorly written story. Decent cinematography and set design enhance the atmosphere of the movie, and the dogfights are intense and entertaining to watch. The movie just doesn't exceed in any area to make it memorable. The narrative is greatly enhanced by Trevor Rabins score. Rabin flexes his orchestral muscles and delivers one of his best scores ever. All in all the movie was a good experience, but it's just so cliched.ACTING: The moment after I saw the trailer I asked myself why couldn't they have spent some money on a good cast. James Franco seems to play the same person in every movie. In his previous outing, The Great Raid, he played pretty much the same person. At least The Great Raid had Joseph Fiennes and Marton Csokas. The only credible actor here is Jean Reno who is always great even though the only reason he got the role was because he's French. Martin Henderson never lands good roles and I really don't like him. He tries to pull off a tough guy with a troubled past here, but you just want to flick his nose and laugh every time he gets all up in James Franco's face. A better cast could have helped with the lack of a quality script, it sure did with The Great Raid.BOTTOM LINE: Amazing dogfights that should be seen on the big screen, but poor acting and a weak contrived script hinders this film from being anything extraordinary.",

Climbing 90 degrees?? Landing a biplane in shell cratered \"no man's land\" in the heat of battle to save a buddy who has his hand (not his arm, his legs, his torso, but just his hand) trapped under the wing of his crashed plane?? That's realism??There wasn't much believable about this film. A third of the way through the movie I fast forwarded through all scenes except the dogfights. I was hoping for something on the order of \"The Blue Max\". \"Flyboys\" stalled on climb out, went into a flat spin, and augured deep into the depths of movie flops!",

(Oh, but you didn't get to smoke. Apparently no one was allowed cigarettes in France during the first world war.) Your uniform was always clean and pressed, and all you had to do to earn your wings was sit around in a hangar and spout off sophomoric one-liners.Here, let me save you a few bucks: just take the shower and volleyball scenes from Top Gun, stretch them out a bit and set them in 1916 France, and you'll pretty much have Flyboys.But the dogfight scenes are cool, right? No. If you want to see brilliant aviators handle WWI-era planes, go buy \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" the outstanding film starring Robert Redford. If you want to watch a multi-million dollar video game, depicting fabric airplanes with 80 horsepower engines performing extended vertical climbs, then see Flyboys.The only redeeming scenes in this film are those in which a few of these snot-nosed little brats get shot of of the sky. Too bad they don't all die. Seems like that's the only way to shut them up.",

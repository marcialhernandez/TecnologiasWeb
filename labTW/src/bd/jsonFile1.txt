    "review/text": "`Kohinoor' is a 1960 black and white Hindi movie sutitles in Urdu and English. Very popular when it was released, three of the most famous artists of the time- Dilip Kumar, Meena Kumari and Jeevan have teamed up to do a remarkable job of acting. It is a long show (two and a half hours), with a story line of the prince and princess in love reuniting after facing tremendous obstacles. The best aspect of the movie is the music. Every song is worth listening to again and again. The dance performances by `Narthaki Rajalakshmi' are remarkable in that she has an unbelievably flexible body and classical dance background. Both Meena Kumari and Dilip Kumar capture the audience with their talent, looks, and powerful presence. An excellent movie to watch, for the old time's sake.",

    "review/text": "If you've ever been even the slightest bit interested in Julia Child, you would understand the fascination of generations of fans who by all means, feel that she was the start of what would eventually become the myriad of the cooking and baking genre. But where some cooking shows are all hype, flash, and gimmicks, Julia was the purest form of the truly pristine art of good cuisine.Granted, she wasn't the first, nor perhaps the greatest French chef (think Escoffier), but she was the first to bring the haughtiness of that marvelous cuisine, to a level that all could enjoy, comprehend, and cook. She came at the right time when the television age was still a toddler, and her decidedly quirky and straightforward manners entertained and relaxed us all as she generously shared her mistakes and triumphs with this grand food.Throughout her true vocation as chef, she had many a program or series. \"Baking with Julia\" was one of her best in that she gladly shared the stage with some of the world's finest chefs and did so with the image one would conjure of a no-nonsense school marm who was watching over her pupil, not so much as to scare them, but to enjoy the experience with them.\"Baking with Julia\" was a 39 part series filmed in 1996 and aired in 1997 and Julia was about 85 years old at the time. While she was, and will always be, dear Julia, one can't but help feel protective with her, as she had visibly aged since her last series from 2 years earlier, and so each episode was that more precious to watch. The respect that she quietly commmanded from her guest chefs was obvious and one would be hardpressed to feel otherwise if one was in her presence. Each episode was the best of the best.The DVD comes in the usual container without any accompanying material, which I felt was a bit of a let down for those who are new to Julia or who just wanted this particular DVD. I think that a recipe booklet might have made the package complete but you could go to the Alacarte TV website to download the recipes or just look in the companion cook book for this series.The back of the DVD shows the 8 photos of baked goods that are taken from the 8 episodes contained within, along with the name of the guest baker in each episode. I wonder if just being in her kitchen was a big a treat for the bakers as it would be for the fans of Julia. (If you ever have the ability to go to the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, DC, you must go to the Julia Child Kitchen and see what it would have been like to be in her kitchen; it has been lovingly recreated with as much original items as possible from Julia's own kitchen and it is fabulous!).The episodes, recipes, and bakers are:Muffins, Scones, Soda Bread, and Popovers by Marion Cunningham (cooking teacher and author)Chocolate Raspberry Ruffle Cake by Alice Medrich (master teacher and chocolatier; what an absolutely exquisite cake; worth the price of the DVD alone!)Custard Brioche Tart by Nancy Silverton (owner of LaBrea Bakery in California)Decorative Loaves of Bread by Steve Sullivan (master bread baker of Acme Bakery in Berkeley)Focaccia by Craig Kominiak (executive chef of Ecce Panis Bakery in NYC)Nectarine Upside Down Chiffon Cake & Chocolate Bundt Cake with Creme Brulee by Mary Bergin (head pastry chef @ Spago's in Vegas)Fruit Tarts by Leslie Mackie (pastry chef and owner of MACRINA in Seattle)Crispy Chocolate Napolean, Fettucine Ice Cream Sandwiches by Gale Gand (pastry chef at several Chicago area restaurants both as partner and/or owner like Brasserie T and Tru)I have noted that some of the chefs/bakers would tend to go through the recipes somewhat quickly because they are used to the fast-paced world of baking, and so at that moment, Julia would ever so gently ask them about the type of ingredient used or the amount needed for that particular step so as to help the viewer understand everything used to bring about the perfection of that creation.The recipes are easy enough, though some labor or time intensive, and delicious. You feel the coziness of learning in Julia's home as compared to a large sterile working kitchens as in some teaching DVD's or shows. And the fact that it is Julia's kitchen, where she lived and worked and loved everything and everyone in her life, makes this series more invaluable and precious.I am hoping that they offer all the episodes to this great series, especially the one where she made a gorgeous wedding cake with Martha Stewart. But we will have to wait and see and hope that the \"powers that be\" understand the impact and import of anything Julia.And yes, if you haven't yet seen the 2009 movie \"Julie and Julia\", by all means, please do. It was a wonderful little journey into her life and you will be thoroughly entertained. And if you really can't get enough, consider reading the book, \" Appetite for Life\" by Noel Riley Fitch, a glorious, thick book of the unconventional life of our unconventional Julia. Bon appetit!",

The \"Baking with Julia 2\" Dvd has been released and still only contains 8 more programs.

The 1st and 2nd movies are worth buying this set (both of which can cost you around $30)3. Each dvd has a bonus dvd4.

Instead, I'm just going to give a quick overview of what to expect from the Blu-Ray trilogy.First, SPIDER-MAN 3 is the same release as the double-disc Blu-Ray stand-alone version. It has lots of special features, commentaries, an extras disc, etc. The movie itself looks very, very good (video quality).It's SPIDER-MAN 1&2 where the set takes a hit. Again, video quality is excellent. SPIDER-MAN 2 includes the \"2.1\" cut (via seamless branching, meaning you can watch the theatrical or the new version off the same disc) with extra scenes, including at least one that is VERY funny.However, what you lose are ALL the extras from the SM 1&2 DVD releases. No commentaries, no deleted scenes (other than \"2.1\"), no \"makings-of\", etc. To me, this was more than disappointing. It's almost criminal. I expected many of the old items to appear in standard-def. Only one bonus blu-ray disc would have been required to hold every single non-commentary special feature, as BD's have 50GB of space compared to 9GB for a standard DVD. Why skimp here, Sony?Ultimately, this is the best way to view the movies. They look AMAZING. The extras in this set, however, are underwhelming, to say the least. You're getting everything you need for SM3, but the first two films are severely shortchanged.",

    "review/text": "Hi, Fat Boy. I am the world-famous film critic, Movie Review Kid, who is gonna tell YOU how to lose weight. First, you need to exercise daily and stop eating fatty foods. Now that I'm done with that, let's get on with the review.This week's movie is Spider-Man-The Motion Picture DVD Trilogy. This little beauty contains the three Spidey movies (Spider-Man [2002], Spider-Man 2 [2004] and Spider-Man 3 [2007]) which are conveniently packaged in this low-priced box set. The movies star Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker a.k.a. your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is the Girl Next Door, Mary Jane Watson, Spidey's love interest. And James Franco as Harry Osborn, Peter's best friend, until he finds out that Peter is Spider-Man who killed his father (explained in more detail below.)Spider-Man is a famous Marvel Comics superhero. With every superhero comes supervillians. A rogues gallery of Spidey's fiercest enemies appear in the trilogy. In Spider-Man, it's the Green Goblin (played by William Dafoe), who is the father of Harry Osborn, turned evil. In Spider-Man 2, it is Doctor Octopus, abbreviated Doc Ock (played by Alfred Molina), a former scientist who is controlled by his evil robot tentacles. In Spider-Man 3, it is New Goblin (James Franco) a.k.a. Harry Osborn who tries to get revenge on Peter after finding out that he killed his father. Another Spidey 3 villian is Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), a burgular who gains sand powers after falling into a particle acclerator (I have no idea what that is). The final Spidey 3 villian is Venom (Topher Grace) a photographer who is stricken with an alien symbiote and given the same powers as Spider-Man, but uses them for evil use.Now that we've patched that up, I--Are you eating chips? If you wanna lose weight, you have got to stop eating this junk. Hey, I see those pork rinds under the pillow. Give them to me! Yeesh, no wonder you're so fat. I bet your mama's that fat, too.--should start telling you about the movies themselves.Spider-Man: High school student Peter Parker's life dramatically changes after he is bitten by a radioactive spider and receives spider powers. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn turns into the Green Goblin and starts terrorizing the people of New York City. Peter starts using his powers to gain publicity and make some extra dough. So this guy who was supposed to give Peter money doesn't give him the money, see. So after that guy gets robbed, Peter lets the thief get away. Then, that thief goes and shoots Peter's Uncle. Ironic, isn't it? Then Peter learns \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" He then becomes Spider-Man, saving people and whatnot. He faces the Goblin on several occasions and the Goblin tries to convince Spidey to join him in a life of crime but Spidey disagrees. It all ends in a climatic battle between the Spider and Goblin and the Goblin ends up dying (Spidey did not kill him; he died by his own hand). Spidey then sends the Goblin home and then Harry sees him and thinks that Spider-Man killed his father. After the funeral, he vows that Spider-Man will pay.Well, after that intense ending, Spider-Man leaves ya begging for more. Two years later, you stop begging. Why? 'Cause the second movie's in theaters. The storyline goes like this:Spider-Man 2: Peter is having a hard time balancing his normal life and his superhero life. First, he's failing school. Second, his best friend, Harry, is out to revenge on Spidey. Third, the girl he loves, Mary Jane, is getting married to John Jameson, the son of the editor of the Daily Bugle (Peter's boss). Dr. Otto Octavius, a scientist, creates these four mechanical arms, or tentacles, to handle this big ball of fire that he is unveiling to everybody. Then, everything goes haywire and there is explosions and Peter transforms into Spider-Man to try to help get things back on track. In all the ruckus, Octavius's wife dies and the scientist decides to blame Spidey for the incident. Then the four mechanical arms mend into his body and he becomes Doctor Octopus. Spidey later temporarily loses his powers and Doc Ock (hearing that Peter is close to Spidey) commands Peter to tell Spidey to meet him at some place or else he'll kill Mary Jane. That scene also has a cool scene where a car comes crashing through the window, that's so cool. Peter gets his power back and the Spider and the Octopus face off in an epic battle. Also, Mary Jane and Harry end up finding out that Peter is Spider-Man. Suprising, huh? I can't tell you how they found out, that would ruin the supriseness.It all ends in this movie. Check it out.Spider-Man 3: Spidey/Peter's life is going great. He has finally got the girl (Mary Jane) and can balance his life. But his friend (Harry) now hates him 'cause he thought that Spider-Man killed his father and then he found out that Spider-Man is his buddy, Peter. Harry then dons the same suit his deranged father had and becomes the New Goblin. He faces off against Peter but gets sent to the hospital afterward. When he is released from the hospital, he cannot remember that Spider-Man killed his dad or that Peter was Spider-Man, which is good news for Peter. But Peter's luck changes when he finds out that the man who killed his uncle (the thief from the first movie) was actually NOT the guy who killed his uncle and that the actual guy who killed his uncle is Flint Marko, a thief who is still at large. This angers Peter because he finds out that when he killed his uncle's shooter, he actually killed an innocient man and that his uncle's real killer is still out there. Now, Flint Marko actually falls into that particle accelerator and becomes half-man, half-sand, or Sandman. So, when Sandman robs a bank and Spider-Man tries to stop him, Spider-Man gets a mouthful of sand. Also, another problem Peter faced was Eddie Brock, a photographer who is out to get Peter's job. Also, an alien symbiote from outer space attaches to Spider-Man turning his suit black, and making him evil, adding to his rage. Now he is equally-matched to Sandman, defeating him once and for all, or so Peter thinks. And also Mary Jane, gets bad reviews from critics about her new Broadway and is upset about it, but Peter has to worry about other things. Then, Harry regains his memory and forces Mary Jane to tell Peter that she does not love him anymore. Then, Peter goes out with Gwen Stacy, trying to make Mary Jane jealous. He causes a mess at the club where Mary Jane sings and ends up throwing her on the floor. Realizing that the symbiote that was controlling his life caused this, he hurries to take it off. When Peter strips the black suit off, Eddie Brock (who Peter recently had fired) is standing below and inherits the black suit and becomes Venom. Venom and Sandman team up to defeat Peter, holding Mary Jane hostage. The ending is intense and you just won't believe it. But I saw the ending, and I believed it.Whew! That was long. I guess this brings my review to an end. If you afford this package, just settle for the individual DVDs then. They also have the trilogy in Blu-Ray, for those who wanna advance. Well then, good-bye from the Movie Review KId...and try to follow my weight loss tips.P.S. It is not the end of the Spider-Man film series. On May 6, 2011, Spider-Man 4 will be released. No lie.",

    "review/text": "Anyone looking to purchase this trilogy is already a fan of the SPIDERMAN movies and wants to know how they stand up in the magic of blu ray. We all know that the original SPIDERMAN was an amzing film - a rare treat of exemplary action with superb acting for a change. Tobey Maguire and cast finally brought to the comic action movie acting ability that made the film believable. With Tobey Maguire was born Peter Parker/Spdiderman. We also know that with SPIDERMAN 2 the same cast and crew came together with a film that far surpassed the hugely succesful and critically acclaimed original to be the best in the trilogy. All that was good in the first was raised many notches. SPIDERMAN 3 was still a good film but certainly not a match for 1 and 2. Very enjoyable but a little lackluster in comparison.Now for the blu ray test. All I can say is AMAZING. The source they are working from on the original is not as superb as the other two which makes the picture quality slightly grainy in its 1080p hd presentation. But this in no means is a bad thing. It is still a very vivid picture with blacks and colors strongly presented. You quickly get used to the slight grain and the film becomes the best presentation you will ever see of it. With SPIDERMAN 2 the caliber raises. All grain is gone and the picture remains crystal clear and vibrant throughout. All fight/action scenes are awesome and the entire film will leave you breathless. SPIDERMAN 3 has a picture of the great quality the same as the second film and it helps immensely to raise the quality of the film itself much higher for you will be in awe watching the richness and awe striking special effects.With all three films the English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio is of the highest quality. Dialogue is strong and crisp with all speakers in strong, heavy use for action sequences and it seems even the smallest scenes manage to work the rear speakers which is rare. These three films are at their best here and perfectly made for the high standards of blu ray. You cannot imagine how great these films appear in blu ray till you actually see them for yourself. You will never be able to view them another way again.I do agree that the only flaw with this set is the absence of substantial special features. They do provide the 2nd disc with SPIDERMAN 3 that is all features but do not have it for SPIDERMAN 1 or 2. Having all this would have made the set perfect. So it is not perfect but it still cannot make me lower my 5 star rating for the blu ray presentation of these films is exemplary.If you are developing a blu ray library and love these films this SPIDERMAN HIGH DEF BLU RAY TRILOGY is a definite must. Highly recommended.",

    "review/text": "...since the movies in the trilogy deserve their own reviews and have been done to death already. The low cost (even lower by $10 since I bought it) is what motivated me to buy this blu-ray disc set. I already have the special editions of all three Spiderman movies on DVD, so I wanted to see what blu-ray would bring to the home theater table, having recently bought a PS3. True, the picture quality is awesome and the audio certainly will blow you away. However, there are hardly any special features - only the third disc has any to speak of. This is an underwhelming effort, considering the massive amount of space availalble on blu-ray discs. Compare, for example, the featurettes and even mini-movies on \"I Am Legend\".One thing I discovered about audio selection: if you choose PCM and your receiver is not capable of processing uncompressed signals (my Onkyo only does HDMI pass-through), all you'll get is simulated surround (e.g. Dolby ProLogic). So I ended up with 5.1 and although it may not be true HD, it's good enough for my 7.1 setup. But if you're an audiophile you would have known about this already.My summary - HD picture quality: a strong 4 stars, audio quality and options: 4 stars, special features: a dismal 1 star - hence the overall 3 star rating. I guess for the price, this set is not too bad, but considering the wealth of possibilities for the Spiderman franchise, it fell short of my expectations.",

    "review/text": "This review is for the Spider-Man: Ultimate High Definition trilogy Box Set.It contains the following films: \"Spider-Man\" (2002), \"Spider-Man 2\" (2004), \"Spider-Man 2.1\" (an extended cut of Spider-Man 2 featuring some new sequences, and some entirely different alternate scenes) and \"Spider-Man 3\" (2007).As for the films, I'd rate them as such:\"Spider-Man\" ... 8 out of 10\"Spider-Man 2/2.1\" ... 10 out of 10\"Spider-Man 3\" ... 7 out of 10 (I didn't hate it, it had a charm and a lot of good factors, despite it's obvious large faults.)The Blu-Ray image is pretty incredible. I already owned all three on DVD, but I wanted to upgrade, as these films deserve the High-Def treatment. All three look significantly better, compared to their standard-def DVD counterparts. The first \"Spider-Man\" is the least dramatic upgrade, but the image is still clearer, sharper and more detailed... I was able to see a lot of things I missed on DVD (I didn't realize how much of the image was lost on DVD from compression and whatnot, because every shot I was seeing things I hadn't seen since the movie theater in 2002)- so even though it wasn't the greatest Blu-Ray picture quality, it was still definitely worth the upgrade.The second and third films are where the High-Def image pays off, though! I had just watched the second and third films days before this set arrived on DVD, and it is like night and day. \"Spider-Man 2\" was astounding in terms of how much more I could see in the image. You felt like you could reach into the movie. Textures looked real (DVD won't give you that), colors were brighter, small things (sparks, bits of glass, sweat, water) had astonishingly more detail. It was a huge upgrade. And \"Spider-Man 3\" was just as incredible- what really got me is that you could literally see things that are invisible on the DVD (Ex. You can see every single speck of sand during the Sandman scenes, and when we see the news broadcast towards the end of the film, I couldn't see the \"horizontal TV lines\" on DVD at all, whereas here, they're clearly visible.).I can't comment much for sound, as I just play my sound through the TV speakers, but judging from that, everything is mixed well.The special features are where this review almost slips- the only special features are those from \"Spider-Man 3\", which felt a bit odd. They are cool features, but it seemed like a missed opprotunity.But all in all, the price (which has come down a lot) makes it worth it. You can find really good quality used or even new copies in the $25-$35 range, so I can't complain much about the features- the price is right, the quality is amazing, and what features there are, are very solid.I'd highly recommend this set! Great films.",

    "review/summary": "One of the Greatest Comic Book and Blu-ray Trilogies Available",
    "review/text": "Following the cult classic status of Blade and the surprising box office success of X-Men, Marvel decided to lend out the rights of another one of their most cherished characters. Based on the success of the cartoons, this was sure to pull in a very specific demographic, but I doubt they expected it to be as popular as it became. It surpassed the success of X-Men, and ushered in a decade that would have many more comic book, cartoon, and toy movies set records. For too many years, these types of properties did not get the respect they deserved as real dramatic and action movies, and not just dumb superhero fun. Spider-Man finally got that due respect. The weekend it came out, my focus was on Star Wars Episode II, but after I saw Spider-Man I was blown away. Like many others of my generation, my fandome really started with the first Spidey film, and then blossomed into collecting stacks upon stacks of comics. The visual effects were not the standard for the time, especially with the aforementioned Star Wars film coming out, but they were still pretty damn good. The music was fantastic, thanks to Danny Elfman (the man behind The Simpsons music, and so many other great film scores). Director Sam Raimi created a truly stylistic and visual masterpiece. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the Evil Dead series. I doubted a director best known for horror movies would do the material justice, but he did not disappoint.Neither did the cast. All of the actors were fairly new to me. I had no idea who most of them were, except Kirsten Dunst I knew from Small Soldiers (I was a child). But I always applaud and appreciate big blockbusters that turn lesser names into household names. Tobey maguire and Dunst had a chemistry that really dold the complex relationship of the two iconic characters they were portraying. To this day, my favorite character, besides Spider-Man, is definitely JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. If ever there were an actor born to play a specific supporting role, it was him. Willem Dafoe was great as Norman Osborn. As the serum changed him from a desperate businessman to a conflicted monster, the not so subtle nuances of Dafoe's performance really began to shine through. If only Green Goblin's costume had less of a silly looking design, then his character would be one of the premier villains in Marvel film history. As it stands, Goblin's costume only hurts the film by making it seem more campy than it really is. It serves as a constant reminder that you're watching a cartoon with real people acting it out. Nevertheless, Spider-Man should definitely be creditted as the film that sparked the hype and interest that comic book adaptations get today. If it were not for Spider-Man (as well as Blade and X-Men), I doubt that movies like Watchmen, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Fantastic 4, Ghost Rider, Punisher, Dare Devil, or any of the other countless comic book and superhero flicks would have been taken seriously enough to be converted from script into film.And the Blu-ray presentation of this old favorite of mine was night and day upon my discovery of the disc. I had seen the DVDs countless times, but it wasn't until my eyes were laid upon the BD that I appreciated every inch of every frame as they were shot. Detail is remarkable. Color is rich. It truly is like watching the movie for the very first time.Spider-Man 2 is what fans dream about when the sequal to a movie as fantastic as Spider-Man is announced. Topping a film as great as that one is a definite challenge, but it seems to happen more and more each passing year. Sequals like this one, X2: X-Men United, T2: Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, and others all have one thing in common. Beyond just being a \"sequal\", they managed to outdo their predecessors in almost every way. Spider-Man 2 is not only a great sequal, it is one of the best comic book movies ever made. It doesn't go for the mature adult feel that The Dark Knight has. On the contrary, Spider-Man 2 maintains that corny camp and tongue-in-cheek humor that made the first one so good. Sure some of the dialogue is cheesy at times, and the action is never tries to be realistic, but isn't that why we go to these movies? To be virtually thrilled to the point of exhaustion? Okay, maybe that's taking it a bit far, but my point remains that these films don't need to strive for realism. Their fantasy elements and use of childlike imagination and wonder are what make them so great.Its about a man with spider-like abilities fighting a man with mechanical tentacles attached to his back. The only thing I felt was lacking in TDK, is very abundant in Spidey 2. There is great humor, and the movie has the overall feel of an actual comic book. I also got a sense of the director and writers respect for their source material, but not being afraid to have fun with it. The ending of this film gave me chills the first few times I saw it. It wasn't until Spider-Man 3 actually came out, that the end of Spidey 2 lost some of its magic. Spider-Man 2 is in a solid second place on the list of my favorite comic book movies of all time. Right above films like The Avengers, Sin City, Iron Man, etc. There is really only one thing I didn't like about the movie. There were too many close-ups of random women screaming. It was okay once or twice, but not four or five times. That's minor though. This movie was a fine achievement. As for the Blu-ray transfer. Is it as great as the first one's? An emphatic yes! Even better, in fact. The adundance of detail and clarity are remarkable. This disc is a reference disc to show how amazing catalogue blockbusters can look.As far as Spider-Man 3 goes, I want start off by saying that I like this movie. Probally more than you do. With that said, I'll also add that it does serve its purpose, which is to prove that any Spider-Man movie will have great special effects, fine character development, okay acting, and make a shitload of money. Spider-Man 3 is a good film in its own right, but only a decent one when put in the tall dark shadow of its amazing, and incredibly revolutionary predecessors. It does not add much of value to the franchise, aside from introducing some of the most popular characters in Spidey's publication history. That said, those characters aren't given the attention and respect they deserve. They feel more like late additions that were shoehorned in. Overall the movie was not terrible though. It was definitely better than both of the Fantastic 4 movies, Ghost Rider, Elektra, and Daredevil, as well as some other less than savory comic book adaptations. The only thing that really held this movie down were the, not one, but two unnecessary dance scenes, and underdeveloped characters. The worst of the two dance scenes was Peter walking down the street like he was in a music video. The second dance scene reminded me of the jazz flute scene in Anchorman. That should never be. Those scenes made me feel like Sam Raimi was too comfortable with the fact that the movie would make alot of money, and there was no major competition in the superhero/comic book movie department, besides a few hits and a couple of upcoming challengers.That may have been passable in the summer of 2007, but now we have The Avengers saga and The Dark Knight trilogy that have set the bar so high that movies like them should be treated with the utmost respect and care. The addition of Gwen Stacy seemed rather pointless to me, unless they planned on ellaborating on the love triangle between her, Peter, and Mary Jane from the comics in later installments that never came to fruition. The running time was noticably longer than the previous two films, and it felt like a bloated Thanksgiving turkey. There's no reason the two dance scenes should have made the final cut. Some editors and directors don't understand what truly qualifies as a \"Deleted Scene\". Aside from the dance scenes, perhaps the biggest issue I have with this film is the treatment of my all-time favorite Spidey villain, Venom. Venom was so obviously a late addition to the script that it made me mad. And in addition to that, he was not the towering, manacing presence that we know him as. I must admit though, I loved the wonderful, yet very predictable team-ups of Spider-Man and the New Goblin versus Sandman and Venom. That really brought something to the movie when it was in desperate need of a kick-start. Spidey 3 was not the disaster it has so often been called by geeks and armchair critics alike, but it wasn't an achievement either.Now for the Blu-ray treatment of this rather mid-level, if slightly above average comic book film. Simply put, it's reference quality. The audio and video transfers are pretty much flawless. The extras are incredibly thorough and comprehensive as well. This trilogy is one of the best looking and sounding sets on the market. The only flaw with the set, aside from the decrease in quality entering the third installment, is the lack of extras on the first two discs. Overall though, this set is Highly Recommended, but the re-releases of the first two films are better than the first two discs in this set.",

    "review/text": "First, a review of the movies. The first Spider-Man movie, while occasionally deviating from the original storyline, was a great movie. It was mostly true to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original tale of the web-slinger. It pulled on the Norman Osborn/Green Goblin storylines and was really enjoyable.The second movie was more goodness and was also really well done. This time we are introduced to Doctor Octopus and we see the beginnings of Harry Osborn going crazy (to later become the second Green Goblin).The third movie was pretty bad, and I am a huge Spider-Man fan. While I really wanted to see Venom as the villain for the third movie, his whole story arc didn't mesh well with the Sandman/Green Goblin arc. And it also didn't help that Topher Grace played the part of Eddie Brock. All I could see is the kid from That 70's Show (not to say anything bad about Topher or the show, I liked them both). But since when was Eddie Brock a puny kid with a grudge? And what's with the symbiote lifting to show his face all the time? This movie had so much potential, but failed to be up to the quality of its predecessors.As for the blu-ray trilogy, it looks amazing! The quality and clarity of the picture is truly great. The only negative I have against the trilogy is the lack of special features for the first movie. With the amount of space on a blu-ray disc, I'm surprised to see so little.",

    "review/summary": "Superman lite",
    "review/text": "\"Spider-Man\" was arguably the first modern super-hero comic book. It demonstrated how a fundamentally idiotic idea (attaining super powers from the bite of a radioactive spider has been mercilessly parodied) could work, if the story resonated with the readers. Lee and Ditko had the sense to make the hero a geeky teenager who has super powers thrust on him, without the experience or wisdom to know what to do. The parallel with the transition from puberty to maturity is obvious, but it works. \"Spider-Man\" was probably the biggest single influence in moving comic books away from melodrama and toward drama.Sam Raimi, a director notorious for over-the-top silliness, would seem the least-likely choice for such material, but he handles it perfectly. The focus is firmly on Peter's relationships with his family and Mary-Jane, even in the third film (which has too many villains, and too many plot lines to tie up). It's underplayed, with Maguire's performance convincingly shy without being sappy. He might be a geek, but he's no dork. Rosemary Harris is especially fine as everyone's idea of the perfect nuturing aunt. Her performance is much better than it has to be.The only unbelievable character is J Jonah Jameson, but then, he was over-the-top in the comics, too; no Perry White, he. J K Simmons (perhaps best-known as the bisexual Nazi murderer-rapist in HBO's \"Oz\") shows he's just as good at comedy, nailing the character. (No jokes, please.)If the Spider-Man films have a problem, it's that there's a limited number of feats a super hero can perform, and only so many emotional conflicts a human being can experience. Not surprisingly, their situations and story arcs are uncomfortably like those in the first three Superman films: Peter swings up to catch Mary Jane as she falls (he later repeats the act with his aunt). He abandons his super-identify because it interferes with what he most wants out of life. People \"on the street\" aid him when he's in trouble. He even loses and regains his super powers. And in the third film, Gwen Stacy's inevitable fall from a building is so close to Lois Lane's helicopter fall (with the mic cable replaced by a telephone cord) that it verges on plagiarism. Not to mention that, as in S3, a drastic change in the hero's personality is a central plot element. Whether or not this is conscious copying, it does give an uncomfortable sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, which is why I've awarded these well-done and entertaining films only four stars.I can't resist pointing out that, as with most super-hero films, there is an utter disregard for the laws of physics. Worse, the animators don't understand one of the most-basic: F = ma. Objects and people move almost instantly from rest to motion (or back), which is not only unrealisitc, but impossible. (Disney had a good grasp of this 70 years ago. Digital animators don't seem to have caught it. Note, for example, how Shrek moves as if his body is massless.) S-M3 also overlooks e = mv^2/2 -- there's no way a swinging crane could crack a building's girders.The Blu-ray transfers are of the high quality one expects. (They /ought/ to be -- Sony owns Columbia.) The second film includes the extended \"2.1\" version. I don't believe there's any supplemental material that hasn't already appeared on the DVDs.",

    "review/text": "I bought this DVD set as my first foray into the world of Blu-Ray and I must say I am not disappointed. The picture quality (especially on Spider-Man 2 & 3) pops off the screen even in 720p. If you're thinking of buying these movies in HD I'm sure you've seen them already in some other format so I won't bother reviewing the films themselves. The reason I gave these DVDs 4 stars instead of 5, however, is because of the complete lack of extras on the first two movies. Also the amount of grain is higher in dark scenes in Spider-Man compared to the other 2 sequels (which have almost none). Other than these small complaints I would say definitely pick this set up if you want some nice demo discs for your collection.",

    "review/text": "Well, everyone who has seen the three movies by now will probably agree that the first spidey was good, the second was great and the third was a letdown in comparison to the first two.This set has the three films, so I think it would be unfair to punish the first two because of the third (like many reviewers have done by now). To watch Spider-Man 2 in full HD glory is going to be a blast for every Spider-Man fan out there.The first movie is a very good movie that is worth enjoying in HD, the second is one of the best superhero films in history and the third... well, the story falls short after the big anticipation generated by Spidey 2 (to many villains end up being a mess like others have put it), and in some points it just becomes too campy to endure, but nobody can deny that in terms of visuals it is still worthy of HD. Add to this all the extras on HD as well and you've got yourself a nice package.The trilogy as a whole is entertaining, and Spider-Man 2 has story, deep villain, epic moments... (I know, I can't spot praising Spider-Man 2), and despite being weak in comparison to the others, the third film isn't that bad. It just had a lot to live up to, and it failed to do so, but you still get some awesome action sequences, and this set in particular includes the other two films.So, the question you should ask yourself: Are three movies worthy of being seen in HD worth of the price? If you enjoyed the Spidey trilogy enough to want to buy it, and if you appreciate High Definition, then I think the answer is definitely yes.",

I still have not watched them through on BD, but I saw enough to give the highest marks.I only speak on BD quality, not the films. If I must, then I would say that the Mary Jane being caputred and held as bait should not be the plot point for all three films, but it is. In the comic books, Spiderman did not spend any where as much time with Mary Jane as in the movies. She was hardly ever involved with exploits. I hope that the next film reduces Mary Jane's role, does not have the villian holding a Gwen Stacey hostage as bait for Spiderman(it will kill the series), and it would not be a bad ideas to follow the comics and have Spidey battle non-traditional Spidey foes such as Dr. Doom, The Punisher (that would have been a good way to tie-in a NEW Punsiher film - think!) or the Leader.This set is a must buy and is probably (along with Casino Royale and politics) why Blu Ray won the war.",

I have a 1080i DLP (4 years old), Playstation 3, and XBOX 360 Elite with HD drive. I run higher end HDMI from Monster Cable, as well as Monster optical for sound. I have a 7.1 surround sound home theater and a 250W sub pushing the base. Not the best setup but absloutely satisfying.The clarity of the blu-ray discs is amazing. Now, that isn't to say that every release is worthy of the new technology, but for this release it is. The special effects are clear and crisp. The sound is wonderful. Just to make sure I was enjoying every little bit of my new experience, I watched the movies on regular DVD before putting in my BD's and I have to say that in some parts of the movie I heard sounds that were not audible before. It is like night and day.We can complain all we want about the content of the last installment in the trilogy, but what is done is done. Yeah, I know that the character development was lacking in 3. Yes, I agree that Topher Grace was a terrible choice for Venom/Eddie Brock... but this is about the technical side..

    "review/text": "What could arguably be one of the greatest trilogy of films(easily in superhero films)to date comes to Blu Ray in a half hearted \"cash in\" release. I am a huge fan of these films and I already own the 2 disc DVD releases for each of the three installments. I was hoping for a definitive Blu Ray release when I bought this, but what I got was very good transfers with no new bonus material! To make matters worse the old bonus material and commentaries for the first two films were NOT even carried over! The only extra for those two films are trailers for two other films and both the first and second discs have the same two trailers on them!Considering the space available on Blu Ray discs, I think this is shameful and insulting to fans. I'm all for moving forward with technology, but not at the expense of the consumer. ...so.......here we go again, first we introduce a new improved format, then we rush to release halfhearted editions, so they can release a better one a year or two later and the vicious cycle continues.OK so now you get past that you will be keeping your original two disc DVD's because the bonus stuff is actually very good and well worth keeping on those editions. Now we get to the transfers, all three films show a very noticeable improvement, but the standard DVD releases look very good too and I'm not sure it warrants a double dip without the extras. The first film looks a bit grainy at times, with the second film looking much better. The sound is a big improvement on all three films. I just do not understand why the bonus stuff wasn't carried over for the first two films. It would have made considering this release to buy a much easier decision.My ratings for the filmsSpider Man - 4.6The first film is creaky at times, but it is so much fun that I can forgive any flaws in it. It's got great characters, action, acting and heart, it's one of the best popcorn flicks you'll ever see. Tobey McGuire may not be the wisecracking Spidey we know from the comic book, but he is completely believable as the young teen with these strange new powers. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Green Goblin even if the Goblin design could have been a little better. I also loved J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst, Robertson and Harris are great as M.J. and Uncle Ben and Aunt May. I know that some think there could have been a lot more development with Parker getting used to his new powers, but I believe this series was known to be a trilogy right from the get go and Raimi wanted to make Spider Man 2 all about the problems that would come with these powers and as we all know he pulled that one off in spades. When you think about the genius of how the first film was handled with Parker not giving much thought to the dangers of his new found gifts, it's a really good movie. I also love the ending of the film which I know also made all the ladies big fans of this film. There is nothing quite so bitter sweet as unrequited love. Besides being an extremely fun film it is also a very important film because super hero films were never taken too seriously until after this film made a ton of money.Spider Man 2 - 4.9Even though this is a superior film to the first, I like the first one better. That's not to say that this could quite possibly be the greatest super hero movie of all time! It's got everything a great super hero film needs, great story, acting, pacing, action,hero, villain, love interest and a touch of comedy. Spider Man 2 also develops the character and answers all the questions the first film didn't fully flesh out. I thought Alfred Molina (a guy I had never heard of at the time) was absolutely fantastic as \"Doc Ock\" . The FX look better and the fight scenes are more appropriate for our web slinging hero with high flying air battles, Spidey shooting web balls and a villain who looks much more like his comic book counter part. Besides having great action sequences Spider Man 2 also has a lot of heart and the love relationship and guilt issues keep this film from becoming just another super hero movie. The blend of drama and action would not be complete without a pinch of comedy which this film hits on every cylinder. Whether it's Spidey delivering pizza, taking an elevator ride or the hilarious use of the song 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' this film has some wonderful funny moments.Spider Man 3 - 4.2OK this one is for my Twin Andrew! I know this film has taken a beating and I would have to agree it is a disappointment. I really don't know how it couldn't be. It' just had too much to live up to. The biggest problem with this film for me is that Raimi didn't make it long enough. I think he knew this would be his last Spider Man film and he should have given this installment the length it needed to tie up all the loose ends from the first two films with the detail it deserved. I do think this is a very good film and only in the area of Venom does it seem rushed. I think Venom needed another 20-25 minutes of time in the film before joining forces with Sandman. this would have given this interesting character time to develop. Venom is a unique character in Web Heads Rogue Gallery and he deserved more than just an add on in this film. He's stronger than Spidey, he knows who Spidey is, he is immune to Spidey's Spider Sense. I think the possibilities are wasted here and I think the extra time would have made all the difference in the world. Considering all that is going on in the bloated finale, I do think Raimi does a good job of keeping things moving without becoming too confusing. I know there are many changes in the comic book history, but you have to expect that sort of thing when a comic book character makes a transition to film. I think Spider Man 3 is a very good film and a fitting end to the series even if a little too ambitious.So overall this is a good set, but for me I would rather have the DVD editions with all the interesting bonus material than better looking films with no bonus material. I will keep both the DVD and the Blu Ray versions. The choice is up to the consumer, but be aware that there is surely a better version around the corner.",

The first movie was one of the best Superhero origin stories ever and a great mix of comedy and action. The only issue was with that goofy Green Goblin costume. You would think for the millions they spent on that movie, someone could have come up with a better costume. The second movie is one of the greatest films of the last decade. The acting, the direction, the story, everything hit the right notes and made for a thrilling, unbelievable experience. And finally, the third film. It was ok. It had some good points, but also some bad. Too many villains and a story that did not stay focused. It was a shame the series had to end on such a mediocre point.The thing that is really important to take away from this review is how awesome it is to watch Spidey swing around in High Def. The Blu-Ray format was invented for movies like this. Even if you own these films in another format, you owe it to yourself to upgrade to these versions. Your eyes will thank you.",

    "review/text": "In this first movie of the Spider-Man franchise (2002) director Sam Raimi did almost everything right. He concentrated on character development and character growth. Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker becomes a fully-realized person before our eyes. He's not a cardboard or cartoon character hero. He's vulnerable, innocent, a wide-eyed likeable person that we can empathize with. Orphaned, he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) in a very modest Queens(?) home. He has a lifelong crush on the girl next door Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst).Bitten by a spider, he gets great powers that he uses to fight evil. Fighting the bad guys becomes a mission more important than his personal happiness and his love for Mary Jane. His wealthy friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) has a father Norm (Willem Dafoe) who because of an experiment gone awry becomes a nut case villain, the Green Goblin, who buzzes around on a flying machine like a sled. The two masked men, Spider and Goblin, go after each other and all heck breaks loose.The subsidiary characters are well-done including J.K. Simmons as Peter's editor who thinks Spider-Man is a menace. Uncle Ben is instrumental in carving out a career for Spider-Man/Peter.Spectacular scenes of Spider aloft weaving in and out through the Manhattan canyons are memorable along with the Roosevelt tram episode.This movie surmounts its action-oriented genre, and creates believable people. Toby's acting is a key to the movie's success and its artistry. Enough teasers and unfinished business was left in this one to spawn sequels and perhaps even a Broadway musical.",

I owned thought 1 and 2 on their special 2 disc edition each, I decided to sell those in order to get the HD version and I kinda regret that.In the box:Spiderman (1 disc)Spiderman 2 and 2.1 (1 disc)Spiderman 3 (2 discs, feature film and bonus features)While the movies look and sound incredible on Bluray, Spiderman 1 and 2 have no extras whatsoever! For a trilogy set so eagerly anticipated by fans, Sony put very little effort in this release. Yes, they released the movies in full HD but got rid of all the extras on 1 and 2! Only Spiderman 3 has a bonus disc and like I said before, is my least favorite of the three. The documentaries, easter eggs (like Alfred Molina dressed as Doc Oc performing \"If I were a rich man\") and bonus features from the first two are not in the trilogy boxset!The only good thing I can think of to make me feel better is the fact that I got this at the Gold Box deal for $37I would definitely recommend this set if you're interested in the movies only, if you expect an upgrade from the DVD versions like I did, this will only disappoint you.",

    "review/text": "I was a minor comic book geek as a kid (Marvel primarily, not DC), and I have to admit, I was fairly pleased when the Raimi-envisioned Spiderman series went into production. The actual comic book was a decent mix of drama, action, and humor, and I was pleased that Sam Raimi did a good job of infusing a lot of those same elements into the movies.I bought the \"Spiderman Trilogy Blu-ray\" series just a few weeks ago, after having never purchased ANY of the single movies either on DVD or Bluray (which is actually surprising for me as I enjoyed them for the most part), so there has been a fair amount of time between the recent purchase and my last viewing of most of the series. I decided to watch all three again over a week, and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I honestly didn't remember that the whole series was as good as it is. Is it phenomenal? No, but it is a solid, interesting, and entertaining presentation of the Peter Parker / Spiderman story.I'm not one of those nitpicks who lambasts every little detail that's different from the actual comic book. I try to consider the bigger picture, the spirit of intent, so to say, and take the movie production as a whole. For the most part, this trilogy hits the target. Tobey Maguire delivers a nuanced but impacting Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst delivers the right balance of emotion and spunk as Mary Jane Watson. The other supporting characters (the Green Goblin, Doc Ock, the Sandman, Venom, Aunt May, etc) deliver with variable impact, but all still carry their weight in the series. The weaker of the three films is number 3 (as most reviewers, myself included, seem to think), but it's still good enough to ably support the series as a whole.Not sure I would give any of the individual movies a solid 5, but the series as a whole is, for me, a definite \"4.5 with a roundup to 5\" rating.Pluses would be the story and character development, with weighty-enough performances delivered by the various actors in the series (especially the mains) and the well-balanced delivery of light and heavy plot lines. Even when the story gets serious, there's a comical element to the whole delivery.Minuses would be the \"everything and the kitchen sink\" approach to the third installment. There's really just too many story elements that distract from a central theme to sink your teeth into. It almost works...but not quite.Again, having never watched the entire series in quick succession, I was impressed by how well it held up as a whole. If for some fluky reason, like me, you haven't purchased any of the previous single titles, this is way worth the buying the series a whole. Though I somewhat enjoyed the newer 2012 re-imagining of Spiderman, I admit, this interpretation of the story offers something the newer delivery didn't.",

    "review/text": "So, I'll make this relatively brief:The movies themselves are great. No bones about it.However, the discs themselves leave a lot to be desired. It seems like the studio rushed this set into production and cheaped out on it. The first two movies have almost precisely zero special features. Completely barebones other than trailers for Ghost Rider & Surf's Up. Neither particularly interesting movies. The third movie has all the special features one would expect on a DVD or Blu-Ray release. But it hardly makes up for the utter lack of features on the first 2 discs of the series.Clearly, the studio has produces Blu-Rays with all the Special Features one would expect for Spiderman1and2and3. So, I really have no idea why the studio cheaped out on this set and didn't include all the discs with the special features that clearly EXIST. Perhaps they had excess stock of the \"barebones\" releases because they were crap and not selling so they wanted to get rid of them? I really don't know.Suffice it to say, this is not the \"ultimate set\" that any and every collector would be lusting after.In my opinion, I overpaid for this set, considering the total lack of features on 2/3 of the movies. And also considering I already own the special editions on DVD, which came with all the features you could ever want. I had hoped this would be an \"upgrade.\" However, it felt more like a downgrade on account of losing all the features, rather than an upgrade from getting better picture quality.I'd even go so far as to say anyone who wants all the features should boycott this release until the studio comes out with a TRUE \"ultimate collection\" making use of the 3 \"complete\" (read: feature-rich) sets. You'd probably be better off buying the 3 individual releases of parts 1, 2 & 3 listed above, rather than this somewhat pathetic \"[in]complete\" set.My hope is that by this set not sellign well, the studio will get the message and make the actual \"ultimate edition\" everyone wants. They clearly have the sets to do it. They just need to swap out which sets they include. Swap in the two sets with features in place of the two barebones sets. Problem solved...So, again, overall bottom line: good movies, bad features. Vote with your money. Buy the individual releases with the features rather than this collection without the features.",

    "review/summary": "Why so good?",
    "review/text": "The entire Spiderman trilogy is so good (particularly the first two) not because of its fantastic FX, made even more marvelous ;-) in HD, not because of great acting that, with intuitive genius, includes over-the-top performances by limited, key actors (editor, villains), combined with over-the-top powers and toys of the villains to link-in the comic-book (alright, graphic novelette) genre's mood, while keeping the performances of Parker and his personal circle on an emotional, earthly level, but the three movies are sooo good because the story is written so well, with the priority on character, character, character, and the love story, as stated in the first movie's opening monologue, and held true throughout.Peter Parker's (Toby Maguire) trials with his family, friend, Harry (James Franco) and love-interest, MJ (Kirsten Dunst), are such that the audience is so drawn into the interactions and outcomes, including the strong, inner struggle Parker has with his super-hero alter-ego, that the FX, stunts, toys, and even the conflict with the villains (who are also excellently flushed out and played, with dual, warmly human and wholly evil sides) is a secondary aspect that provides, more than anything else, pace and excitement to accent the real story that moves with the slower pace a plot moved by character demands. This is what good writing, the most important component of any story, in any media, is all about, and with all three Spiderman movies, the good writing prevails, opposite to so many or almost all movies of the genre which make the FX and the combat of villain and hero the centerpiece and wraps a plot, if a story, around that, resulting in another Hollywood failure added to the heap of such two-star-and-less failures.Great casting also contributes to the effectiveness of character development and the story. The more common, physical attributes of the two leads helps keep their lives down to earth, contributing to an aurora of believability that the viewer can buy into, which would have been greatly diminished if the producers would have filled the role of Parker with a Twilight-James-Dean incarnation (like James Franco, who plays Harry, Parker's friend) and MJ with a compatibly stunning beauty. And the villains' characters are excellently brought to life by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Thomas Haden Church.The three movies of the first-generation Spiderman are all anyone could hope for, except to hope that the new generation will be produced with care that the same values making the first generation a stand-out will be in the fore of the minds of the writers, producers, and director.",

    "review/text": "The Spider-Man trilogy has enthralled audiences and made comic book fanboys like myself so happy to see our beloved webslinger on the big screen. Here, we have the (so far) definitive Blu Ray release of the trilogy. We have Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, and Spider-Man 3. All in all, it's a 4 disc set. Now, since it's in high definition, we can expect perfect picture and sound right? In this case, oh yes. The Spider-Man trilogy is a perfect showcase of the richness and power of high definition video and the capabilities of the Blu Ray format. It's sad to say that there are only a handful of Blu Ray releases that actually look great and this set is no exception.First off, the video presentation is superb. I watched the films on my Sony BD-S350 Blu Ray player in 1080p (HDMI) on my new Toshiba Regza 42\" television with a Bose 5.1 surround sound system, just for reference. Spidey 1 is presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio with part 2 and 3 in 2.40:1 ratio. The films are filled with special effects and the 1080p transfer delivers the goods. Definition and depth be clearly seen in the actor's faces and even their clothes. You can really see the depth of the fibers in Mary Jane's green sweater at the laboratory field trip, it's that good. Flesh tones and black levels are fantastic and the films feel alive. If you thought the DVDs looked good, you'll see them as obsolete upon viewing the Blu Ray versions. DVDs do not do any justice to the films. The scenes of Spidey swinging through New York just look amazing and Venom in part 3 just looks fantastic. All in all, this is a MUST BUY for Spidey fans and just to show off your fancy Blu Ray player.The audio is presented in PCM tracks and actually sounds better if not as good as TrueHD audio encode. The 5.1 mix is superb and allows great clarity of the voices, action, and music. The sounds just emit from the speakers with such vibrant resonance that you feel that you are swinging with Spidey around New York. Overall, the audio is dynamic and warm and will sound great with your home theater setup.Next, we have the special features. One of the letdowns of this set is the lack of special features for films 1 and 2. Spidey 3 includes the second disc of special features found in the DVD set and stand alone Blu Ray copies. Although, Spider-Man 2 does feature the extended Spider-Man 2.1 which I believe is just as good if not much better than the theatrical cut. Spidey 3 features 11 behind-the-scenes featurettes going over the villains, the stunt work, and the sets. Seeing how Sandman and Venom were brought to life in intriguing. All in all, it's a shame that the extras from 1 and 2 didn't make it here, so I guess it's good I kept my DVDs.Final words, it's a must buy. I can't recommend this set enough. Spider-Man 1 and 2 are landmark achievements and amazing films whereas part 3 was just cluttered with too much plot and an incoherent story ( I really hoped that they would redo this one but alas, they didn't). Even if you don't like part 3 ( I actually liked it for the action and effects), it's still enjoyable and you'll want to watch it when it looks this good. This is definitely a perfect way to show off Blu Ray, other than a nice CG animated movie or another special effects-ladened movie. Movie and comic fans alike will enjoy this box set and plus, it's the only way to get part 1 and 2 on Blu Ray. I give the video a 5/5, the audio a 5/5 and the extras a 3/5. the overall box is a 5/5 and a must buy.",

Spider-Man is one of the top selling comic book characters in the world, and for more than forty years he remains one of the most beloved superheroes of our time. I have grown up reading the spider-man comics as well as watch the early 90s Saturday morning cartoon, then when news cames that a live action picture was slated to come out; I was eager to be one of the millions to bare witness the Amazing hero coming to life on the silver screen. After the success of the first film, then came the sequels, which were able to outdo the achievement of the original film. I have to be honest that I think the second film was an astonishing piece of work, because it stood more to the hero's alter ego rather than going into the web-swinging action. Spider-Man-The Motion Picture Trilogy is a must own for every movie lover. No collection is complete without this pure spun gold set piece.",

I personally did not care much for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). I feel as if she was a little fake and overly dramatic. Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) I know a lot of comparisons have been made to Garfield from The Amazing Spiderman, but for this series, Maguire was great. I am not much of a James Franco fan as he plays Harry Osborn. One carachter that I loved was William Dafoe playing the Green Goblin. I like most of Dafoes movies though. Spiderman 2-I personally liked more than Spiderman 1, I particularly enjoyed Doc Ock (Alfred Molina). I loved this movie, the drama of Parker having to be Spiderman, and the train scene was the best! Spiderman 3 was worth watching, but that is it. The CGI was still amazing, but the story line was horible! They were in a rush to end this trilogy and felt the only way was to introduce a bunch of villians at once. Sandman would have made a good villian for a movie, Venom should have had his own movie! I think the fightes were to short in duration as well. Very disapointed with this movie altogether, but so were millions of other people! Overall I bought the trillogy for $20 with free shipping. My overall rating is for all three movies combined Picture quality- 5/5, sound quality 3/5 (this is mostly due to my TV's limitation, a sound system is in the works) Story 4/5 (Spiderman 1-5/5, Spiderman 2-5/5, Spiderman 3-2/5). Overall value-4.5/5, an overall great value. Spiderman is now Amazing, but we already knew that. lol",

    "review/text": "Some love the whole trilogy, some may dislike it here and there, but in the end, most of us enjoys it!This trilogy is one of my first Blu-ray movies(bought it in early 2008), and even now, though the picture quality of the latest Blu-ray movies improved a lot compared to the ones a few years back, the quality of the Spider Man series hold up. The audio is equally great, and will satisfy the audiophiles.As of extra features, part 1 and 2 doesnt have any. Though 2 have the 2.5 version(additional scenes). Part 3 though got tons of extras to make it up, and in fact, got 2 discs - 1 for the movie, another for the special features.Movie wise, I love them all. Part 1 is an origin story, and though I dont like origin story too much, its pretty good. My only complain is Green Goblin's robotic look, so different from the comics. But then again, I guess the exact comic version(just as most comic characters) wont look good in a movie.Part 2 is my favorite(and I think everyone agrees its the best of the three) - its a great blend of action, humor, drama. Everything here is done perfectly, and arguably one of the best comic book to movie adaptation.Part 3 is a mixed bag to different people. Some dislike it, some even hate it with a passion. Personally, I enjoyed it. My 2nd favorite of the three. I just love the... well I wont spoil it much(though really, who havent seen the trilogy yet at this time and age?!), but as a big comic book fan, it reminds me to one of those team-up storylines. Yes, it could have been better, and some major characters isnt fleshed out much, but hey, Raimi and company did what they can to fit everything to a 2 hour plus movie.In the end, the Spider Man Trilogy is a great popcorn flick, and very much worth the purchase, whether youre a comic book fan, a movie collector, or just want to watch some entertaining movies. Oh, if there is one complain I got... Kirsten Dunst just doesnt make a good MJ. Tobey Maguire as Parker is acceptable, and in fact, I grown to like him as Spider Man; but Dunst... just the wrong actress for the character if you ask me. But thats just me.",

    "review/text": "This DVD has rare footage of Steven De Groote (1977 Van Cliburn competition Gold Medalist) playing Chopin Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1983 when he was 30 years old. De Groote died in 1989 at age 36. While visiting relatives in South Africa, he was hospitalized for pneumonia and influenza, eventual cause of death was inflammation of the liver. We lost one of the most promising pianists of his generation.The program on the DVD is:Schumann: Hermann und Dorothea Overture op.136Chopin: Concerto in F minor No. 2 op. 21 for Piano and OrchestraTHEN, you have to let the credits roll (odd navigation menu work here),and the Schubert clip starts up:Schubert: Symphony No. 6 in C major D 589Also on the DVD is an \"Audio Special\" (video is just a still of a landscape painting) of Schumann's Manfred Overture op. 115Considering you can get a copy of this DVD for less than $10 (as of Feb. 2010) this DVD is a bargain, for the De Groote footage alone. The audio quality is surprisingly good for 1980's video too, there is a Dolby 5.1 audio track, but surely the original recordings were stereo only. De Groote and the orchestra are in white tie, but there is no audience in the concert hall, and you'll appreciate that (lack of coughing, dropping programs, etc). As far as rating the DVD 4 stars, I nicked the producers a star for the flaws in the menu system, otherwise (musically) it's 5 stars for it's musical history value. Note that there are no program notes included either, merely a one-page catalog of their other DVD's in the series.",

His CD recordings, including outstanding interpretations of Beethoven's Eroica and Mozart's Requiem with the Dutch Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century, are sought out by his fans. I was curious to see him in action and found the experience of this 1991 Lugano film highly rewarding. The Lebrun Oboe Concerto is not very memorable, but pleasing to the ear, and the soloist Omar Zoboli is excellent. The concert's highlight is Mozart's Haffner Symphony, presented with all repeats, in a gripping, dramatic and what might be called \"semi-authentic\" performance. Br&uuml;ggen has his musicians, the very fine Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana, on their toes throughout, playing with minimal vibrato, sharp accents in the brass and the timpani, and a stylishly lean classicist string intonation. On all accounts, this is a bargain as well as a collector's piece.",

    "review/text": "I quite enjoyed The Man From Utah (1934), but it is a rather peculiar old western. John Wayne plays John Weston, a stranger who rides into town, saves the local marshal's life in the aftermath of a bank robbery, and soon finds himself entering a rodeo as an undercover detective of sorts. It seems that the rodeo organizer's boys keep winning all the prize money at each event, while outsider entrants who have a chance to win keep getting \"snakebit,\" literally. It's up to The Duke to infiltrate the gang, figure out how they operate, and save the day. There is a good bit of rodeo action, but a significant portion of it comes from stock footage used in a good number of other early films; this is clearly a mark against The Man From Utah, but it is an understandable way to make a cheap movie back in depression-marked 1934. If you haven't seen the footage elsewhere, it won't matter at all to you. What really distinguishes this film is the music. The movie opens with John Wayne riding into town strumming a guitar and singing; I believe this is stock footage of someone other than The Duke, though. What really got me, though, was the insertion at times, usually during a chase scene, of unusually prominent music consisting mainly of organs and horns (at least, that's what it sounded like to me). I suppose this was done to add tension or excitement to important parts of the film, but the sound of quasi-classical music coming from out of nowhere during an old western really struck me as quite odd. The Man From Utah does have its problems, but it still features John Wayne playing the hero as only he can; this and the presence of the always entertaining Gabby Hayes make this an entertaining old western that all fans of The Duke should enjoy.",

    "review/text": "&lt;strong>The Man from Utah&lt;/strong> (Robert N. Bradbury, 1935)One of the many, many two-reel westerns Robert N. Bradbury directed for Lone Star Pictures featuring a young John Wayne, a young Yakima Canutt, and Gabby Hayes, who was never young. I've watched quite a few of these over the past few years, and I often refrain from reviewing them (I review all features, but very few shorts, and my personal line for that division is sixty minutes), but this one being of average quality, I figured I'd use it as an indicator for much of the batch (and for the pictures Wayne and various other members of this band of merry men were also making for Republic Pictures at the same time).The plot is pretty generic, as far as John Wayne Lone Star westerns are concerned: Wayne plays John Weston, a rodeo star sent underocver by the U. S. Marshals (bet you can't guess what state he's from!) to investigate corruption in the annual rodeo in a small Arizona town. Seems every time someone from out of town looks like they're about to win the top prize, they end up dead, and the Marshals want to know why. Things get more complex when a pair of outlaws rob the safe containing the prize money, and Weston, having discovered the crime, is walked in on and immediately assumed to be the thief.Nothing here out of the ordinary--Wayne gets a chance to show off some of his trick riding skills (though obvious body doubles are used for some shots for both Wayne and Canutt), the criminals are dunderheads, the good guy wins in the end. If you're a fan of the genre, this will work for you. If you're not, it won't. Simple. **",

This particular DVD has some of my all-time favorite episodes! Before I get to the full review, I'll give you a brief synopsis of the episodes.1. Granpuff (Written by the Rev. W. Awdry/Adpated by Britt Allcroft and David Mitton) - The engines are having trouble getting to sleep one night, so Thomas tells them all a story about a narrow gauge railway. \"Once upon a time, there were three little engines who lived in their own little shed on their own little railway\". The little engines are named Duke, Stuart, and Falcon. At first, Stuart and Falcon are cheeky, but they straighten up when Duke tells them a story about an engine who got turned into a generator for being extremely rude and constantly falling off the rails. Later, the railway is closed, Stuart and Falcon are bought by another railway, and Duke is left alone in his old shed...2. Sleeping Beauty (Written by the Rev. W. Awdry/Adapted by Britt Allcroft and David Mitton) - ...however, Duke is not forgotten. This story forms the second half of a two-parter, with \"Granpuff\" being the first half. Almost 30 years after Duke's old line was closed, some visitors come to see Sir Topham Hatt and explain that they want to find and restore Duke. They go out looking for him, but have little or no luck. That is, until one of them falls through the ground and ends up landing on Duke's boiler. Duke's shed is all over-grown and Duke is very rusty. The \"rescuers\" (as they are referred to), explain that they come from the railway that bought Stuart and Falcon and that they are here to restore him. They get Duke out of the shed and take him to the Skarloey Railway, where Stuart and Falcon (now named Peter Sam and Sir Handel) are waiting for him.3. A Bad Day for Sir Handel (Based on \"Sir Handel\" by the Rev. W. Awdry/Adapted by Britt Allcroft and David Mitton) - There is a narrow gauge railway with two little engines named Skarloey and Rheneas. Rheneas has been sent to the Works to be mended and two new engines have come to help out. Their names are Sir Handel and Peter Sam. Peter Sam is a happy little engine, but Sir Handel is very grumpy and doesn't wish to pull coaches (he calls them \"cattle cars\"). He reluctantly pulls the coaches to a station. However, when told he is to pull freight cars, Sir Handel refuses and purposely derails himself. Needless to say, Sir Topham Hatt is not pleased, and scolds Sir Handel.4. Rusty Helps Peter Sam (Based on \"Trucks!\" by the Rev. W. Awdry/Adapted by Britt Allcroft and David Mitton) - Sir Topham Hatt has bought a diesel engine named Rusty to help Sir Handel and Peter Sam out on the narrow gauge railway. Sir Handel wants to try to get out of pulling freight cars and Gordon tells him to pretend that he is ill. Sir Handel takes his advice, and Peter Sam is told to take Sir Handel's cars as well as his own. When Peter Sam reaches the quarry, he hooks up his cars to a slope, and the loaded cars pull the empty ones up. The loaded cars don't see Peter Sam properly and think he is Sir Handel. The cars don't like Sir Handel, and they purposely break away from the chain controlling their speed down the slope. This creates a horrible accident and leaves Peter Sam in a very bad state with his funnel dented. Rusty helps clear up the mess and pulls Peter Sam home. Sir Topham Hatt finds out what happened and scolds Sir Handel for pretending to be ill.5. Rusty to the Rescue (Written by Britt Allcroft and David Mitton) - Rusty wants to find a steam engine, so he asks Douglas and Percy where. Douglas informs him that the only place to find one is on the Other Railway, but only extremely brave engines go there. Rusty makes up his mind to go there and find an engine. He does, and finds a steam engine named Stepney sitting in a scrap yard. Rusty's crew cleam Stepney up a bit and take him out of the scrap yard. Stepney has been saved from scrap, and now lives on the Bluebell Railway.6. Thomas and Stepney (Based on \"Bluebells of England\" and \"Stepney's Special\" by the Rev. W. Awdry/Adapted by Britt Allcroft and David Mitton) - Percy informs Thomas that a famous engine named Stepney who lives on the Bluebell Railway is coming to visit Sir Topham Hatt's Railway soon. Thomas is immediately jealous of this famous engine. When Stepney arrives, he is asked to pull a special train, and Thomas is shunted into a siding to allow Stepney and his special to pass. Thomas is made even more cross by this. The next day, Stepney apologizes for having Thomas shunted and flatters him by telling him that he (Thomas) knows the line much better than Stepney does. Thomas and Stepney become friends.7. Music Video: Gone Fishing (Written by Mike O'Donnell and Junior Campbell/Pefromed by Junior Campbell) - A song about taking a day out to go fishing.I LOVE this DVD! It is one of the best \"Thomas\" DVDs ever! I love the introduction of the narrow gauge engines, as well as Stepney. However, I do have a bit of a problem with the title episode, \"Rusty to the Rescue\", as it does NOT tell the true story of how Stepney was saved from scrap. Stepney is a real engine, and you can see him on the Bluebell Railway in Sussex, England. However, \"Rusty to the Rescue\" implies that Rusty rescued Stepney (in reality, Stepney was saved by the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society) AND that the Bluebell Railway is a part of the Island of Sodor (it isn't. It is part of England). Despite that, I do enjoy all six episodes as well as the music video. This DVD is one of the few places where you can hear Junior Campbell's singing voice (he & Mike O'Donnell wrote all of the \"Thomas\" songs from Seasons 3-7). All in all, a great DVD for \"Thomas\" fans of any age.",

The quality of the concert production is excellent. The background dialog gives you an appreciation of her background. The songs performed are not exactly as per the album which is a bonus as you get to appreciate other ways of producing the songs. The feeling that comes over is the commitment and honesty of Nanci. She communicates with her audience on an awesome level and this is translated into the viewer's experience. This video is a must for all Nanci fans and lovers of mainstream country.David Askew,Auckland, New Zealand",

    "review/text": "You know a documentary is not off to a promising start when the narrator repeatedly mispronounces the name of the subject of the documentary. (Lewis Carroll's real name, Dodgson, was pronounced with a silent \"g\": that is, \"Dod-son\".)The narrator also mispronounces the name of Carroll's most famous illustrator, saying \"Te-NEEL\" instead of \"TENN-i-el\" (that is, rhyming with \"perennial\").At another point, he actually refers to Carroll as \"Liddell\". He mispronounces \"ideologies\" as \"ideal-ologies.\"At another point, he talks about a rainstorm in which Carroll and his child friends were caught as inspiring the \"valley of tears\" section of ALICE. The VALLEY of tears?! I assume he means the \"pool of tears\".In another place he refers to Carroll's habit of figuratively \"marking with a white stone\" the happy days in his diary as a \"Biblical\" symbol. It was actually a pre-Christian Roman custom.He also refers to Carroll's famous boat trip with the Liddell sisters as taking place on \"Independence Day\" -- July 4th. The fourth of July isn't actually a holiday in England. Independence Day is an American holiday.All this typifies for me the whole sloppy, lazy approach taken in this rather shallow exploration of the lives and relationship of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddell. When the narrator mispronounced a word -- or accidentally called the subject of the documentary by the WRONG NAME -- couldn't they be bothered to record a second take? Was the director not paying enough attention to even notice that it happened?In addition, \"facts\" are repeatedly introduced, but not supported. One typical example: \"Father William is thought to be based on Jowett ...\" Thought by WHO?Several longish tangents are devoted to the lives of Watts, Wordsworth, and Blake -- as it is asserted they were an influence on Carroll -- but those sections really add little to our understanding of Carroll. It would have been sufficient to say in one sentence that, say, \"Carroll was parodying the many familiar moralizing poems of Isaac Watts.\"About a third of the documentary consists of the narrator recounting in unnecessarily tedious detail the whole familiar story of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" -- throwing in occasional interpretive \"facts\" supposedly related to the writing of the story (though some of these are questionable and mostly unsupported as well).The few plusses about the DVD are that it shows many nice and interesting photographs of Victorian Oxford -- though it is rarely explained what they are, and they tend to be shown repeatedly. (At one point a photo of John Ruskin is shown in a section that has nothing to do with Ruskin, and it is not said who he is. It is as if the filmmakers thought, \"Well, here's an interesting Victorian-looking man\" -- and that was good enough for them.)Also, the special features include quite nice prints of the 1903 and 1915 silent film versions of Alice. Those are the reason I am keeping this DVD.Otherwise, you would do better to find and read several of the good, illustrated biographies of Carroll available.",

    "review/text": "Almost 3 hours long, Born in 68 is three films in one. This is a very long film, punctuated with some wonderful performances between seemingly eternal interludes.The first film is the story of a group of students in Paris, May 11, 1968, at the student revolution at Nanterre. Their revolution is against the tyranny of military service, the government, and thought control. The group moves to an abandoned farm in the south of France to start a commune of free love and sharing for all. The second film is the bridge where the commune falls apart, several children are born (most importantly two boys), and most everyone moves on to very different lives, save Catherine. The third film is the love affair between the two boys and the next generation's sexual revolution questioning gender.Each act or film is marked by bookends, very similar scenes, which mark the end or beginning of the next act. This was a difficult film to follow. Time did not move in a linear fashion. People lost or gained beards, changed hair styles; women were shown large with baby and then delivering children, children got taller, but nobody ever really aged. Twenty and thirty years later, Catherine had the exact same gorgeous face and figure as she did in the beginning of the film. There were a few intercut titles that advanced the story several years. At one part of the film, a day lasted 10 or 15 minutes, and then time advanced with no warning several years in a minute or two. It was very difficult to figure out how much time had passed. It was also very difficult to keep track of the characters.The story telling aside, this is a pretty movie. The scenery in Paris and the South of France is gorgeous. The actors are all very beautiful with their clothes on and off. The politics were nicely placed in the film; we follow Mitterand and then Chirac as two opposite presidents and their effect on the characters of the film. It is a pleasant film to watch.Technically, this is a well constructed film. Camera work is steady. Shots are deliberate and well planned. The pacing is acceptable; the third act is a lot too long. I found myself during the last twenty minutes asking to film to just be finished.The film is presented in French with English subtitles. The film is Not Rated, but is probably destined for mature audiences. There are many adult scenes, herbal cigarettes are smoked fairly frequently, there is a long completely nude outdoor dance with full frontal male and female nudity, early in the film an abortion is performed, and there are many scenes of males and females, and males and males having sex (although these scenes are done artfully). There was a bit of strong language in the subtitles, but nothing gratuitous. Violence was minimal, two gay men were beat up by some motorcycle riders, and a man is shown dead beside a waterfall. The translation is very good.Overall, I didn't love this film. But then again, I didn't hate this film. It was hard to follow at times. I wish the passage of time was marked more clearly. For the French the eras are fairly well marked given the cars, politics, and clothes. It might be a bit difficult for non-French to exactly place the years. It is a long film.",

It is low budget beyond low budget, and you get a headache from listing to fake, incoherent characters who look like they were picked off the street of some ghetto. And those who like to see booty-there is basically none, just one scene which lasts about 15 seconds and features a silent, unattractive &quot;dancer&quot;.. If you are a fan of these movies, rent it first, you'll see. If you buy it, you will find a movie devoid of beautifull black women and good looking guys, but which is filled with stupid humor and a story which will put you to sleep.",

    "review/summary": "Gentle Family Drama",
    "review/text": "\"Hum Saath-Saath Hain\" is reminiscent of some of the other family-centered Hindi dramas of the 1990s, such as \"Hum Aapke Hain Kaun\", and it preceded the very popular \"Khabi Khushi Khabhie Gham\", which deals with similar themes. These themes are family unity; obedience to parents; loyalty to siblings; and the potential for family erosion when doubt and suspicion creep in.The family at the core of this film is comprised of mother, father, and three sons who all live happily together and work for the prosperous family business (there's also a daughter, but she's already married and therefore lives with her husband's family). The family functions according to a strict but loving hierarchy, in which the eldest son Vivek (Mohnish Behl) marries first and is set to inherit the top position in the family firm; the second son Prem (Salman Khan) is sent abroad to study so that he can also join the company; and the youngest son Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) is mischievous but always looks up to his elder brothers.The first two hours of this three hour film are without any major family strife or drama - the focus is on the daily functioning of the family and the pairing off of each brother with his respective sweetheart. Vivek, Prem and Vinod all get engaged in turn as the couples sing, dance, and bat their eyelashes at each other over the course of two hours. When Preeti bakes sweets for Prem (his favorite sweets, of course!), that counts as high drama. If the intricacies of life in an extended family hold no interest for you, then you will likely be bored to tears. If, however, you enjoy delicate flirtations and the visual feast that is Hindi cinema, then it will be a pleasant two hours.The twist doesn't come until the final hour. When the daughter of the family experiences some difficulties in her husband's home, the mother becomes paranoid that a similar schism will occur in her own family, carefully balanced as it is between three brothers and their three wives-to-be. In a moment of doubt, the mother causes the very schism she's afraid of, but under the pretense of protecting her two younger sons from the power of the elder (who's also only their half-brother). I'm not giving away anything shocking when I say that all will be resolved in the end, since the very foundation of this film is the idea that family bonds should never be broken, and this family in particular is unbreakable.All of the actors turn in fine performances; surprisingly, no one actor is the star over any other. Salman Khan plays the shy, gentle brother and as such his performance is more subdued than usual. Mohnish Behl is great as the always-responsible, noble elder brother and Saif Ali Khan is credible as the playful, responsibility-dodging youngest brother. The three women (Tabu, Sonali Bendre, and Karishma Kapoor) are lovely, but they don't have much scope for nuance in their roles; they are all dutiful, loving women who act appropriately and obediently. Not much room for drama in such idealized characterizations.In summary: watch this film if you enjoy family-centered Hindi dramas with delicate romance and lots of agonizing over the social rules of family life.",

There is only about one hours worth total of movie without singing and dancing and IF YOU DON'T SPEAK OR READ HINDI HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO RECOMMEND A 3 HOUR MOVIE. I am a lover of romance movies so I stuck with it but I just had to keep fast forwarding to the dialogue after a few minutes oF what the heck are they saying mode....HUGE MISTAKE.

    "review/text": "The Triangle.Tommy Devane (Dan Cortese) is having the same nightmares as Charlotte Duval (Olivia d'Abo), a woman he's yet to meet. This is never a good thing. Stu Sheridan (Luke Perry) is having money problems but doesn't let that stop him from going on a fishing vacation with his best buds and the girlfriend no one expected him to bring. Also, not a good thing. The third bud in this triangle is Gus Gruber (David Hewlett), a man obsessed with the Bermuda Triangle. He has heart issues and routinely pops pills for this condition. Obviously, a very bad thing. With little money amongst them, they are forced to hire a crappy boat skippered by Captain Louis Morgan (Dorian Harewood). His first mate is the aforementioned Charlotte of the dreams. If this connection is supposed to be spooky or unsettling, it doesn't work. Neither does the voodoo ceremony that takes place (but didn't take place?) and doesn't really have anything to do with the matter at hand: they go fishing and end up in the triangle with a lost ship from a bygone era. They board said ship for a variety of bad reasons and immediately lose their fishing boat. Stu becomes possessed or just shows his mean streak, hard to tell with the level of acting at Luke Perry's disposal. His character goes from being obnoxiously exuberant to almost devoid of any personality whatsoever. He scowl's a lot. It makes him look really old (when he was trying to come across as deranged?).It's a limp ghost story with only one visible/invisible ghost: a little boy with grabby hands. Treasure of a sort was involved, everyone just wanted to go home, not everyone made it, and the last minute remarks only added to the overall confusion of the piece. I don't know what they were trying for: adventure on the high seas, a crazy friend on a killing spree, or a spooky ghost story lacking in ghosts. It didn't succeed on any level, even as a simple buddy flick it failed. The level of suspense is nil. There's little in the way of atmosphere. The characters are uniformly dull. Is there a rating lower than G? Any bite that the story might have had was either not written in or was censored for television? There was very little to like or dislike. They played it safe and it shows.As for the second feature, 2103 The Deadly Wake, I'm still trying to figure out the title. Wake as in boat or wake as in \"get up!?\" Whatever, it's a low low low budget film; most of the action takes place on board a ship and a triangle room somewhere else. The cast is mostly unknown or has-beens (Michael Pare & Malcolm McDowell). Not a great deal of emoting was expected from anyone, including baby, the ship's brain (literally, a baby in a jar, hooked to the ship with cables and wires). The action is sparse, the plot flimsy, the special effects laughable, not a lot of effort went into this production, and it shows. The story: a disgraced drunkard (Malcolm McDowell) is tricked into commanding a ship with dubious cargo....by the same people who led to his disgrace on a previous occasion. The crew, convicts. The cargo is toxic waste and a plague virus. The owners don't want the ship to reach its destination so bombs are planted onboard, twice. Also onboard is a dancer-bot who kills almost everyone by moving deliberately like a dancer (in itself, very bizarre, but also very stupid). The slow pacing didn't help, nor did filming everything in odd shades like sepia or blue tones. With few likable characters and an uninvolving story, by the end I really didn't care who won or who didn't, I was just glad it was over. At 100 minutes, it felt like 4 hours!",

I've read other reviews on a few of the &quot;power yoga tapes&quot; out there, some with weak workouts and others with irritating instructors, so I couldn't resist the rave reviews on the Power of Hatha tape and its inspirational instructor, and bought the tape on those recommendations.I agree with those reviews: I love the instructor, the ambience of the tape, and his calm demeanor guiding you through the poses. The music isn't wacky and the poses are strong. This is great, straightforward yoga.However my only complaint was a personal preference thing: I prefer flow style yoga, and as another reviewer mentioned, this is NOT flow. This is a tape of individual poses laid out consecutively. You do get into and out of each one properly and hold each for an appropriate period of time, which should be a great challenge for anyone who enjoys practicing by doing individual poses. However, I prefer flow style ashtanga where each asana is approached via Sun Salutation movements, etc.; constantly moving, no stopping till you drop (or until it's time for floorwork.)If you prefer to do flow, like me, you might want to think twice about purchasing this tape; I resold it within a day. However, if you're not partial to flow (or you like to vary your practices), or if you just want to add new poses to your arsenal/practice your favorites at home, or even if you just want to tune in for a few poses, my guess is you'll really enjoy Naader Shagagi's style and this nicely produced work.",

    "review/text": "I must first begin by saying that this video is long-- approx. 1 1/2 hours. All of the basic hatha yoga postures are included in the video, beginning with sun salutes, triangle poses and the warrior poses, but the breaks in between each pose (during which the instructor relaxes and rolls his shoulders) break the flow of the movements. The standing poses are excellent as a warm-up and stretch for a vigorous workout (i do these before running or jumping rope). The floor exercises, which follow about a 3 minutes period of &quot;dead body pose&quot; are challenging, but dangerous. Without the assistance of a live instructor or, at least, more guidance from Naader, many of the floor poses can have a detrimental effect on one's back and neck-- especially the inverted poses.In short, this video is not necessarily a workout unto itself-- unless you're only trying to increase you flexibilty and balance (both skills that are certainly well addressed by Naader). The movements don't flow together at all, resulting in a session that is more choppy and less physical, graceful and rejuvinating. If you're looking for the latter, try Yoga Zone's Yoga for Weight Loss-- an excellent, physical, graceful, and shorter (30 minutes) tape.",

I tried other instructors and other videos, but Naader's approach is the best -- a balanced mix of yoga instruction and inspiration. I have shared this tape with many friends (who then bought their own copy!) and they all agree that Naader's instructions are easy to follow and the pace is slow enough that beginners can figure out what is going on before the next pose; but not so slow that experienced students get bored. Furthermore, since he is doing the poses along with the student, he knows just when to offer that extra word of encouragement when you are about to give up! I find something new to ponder each time I listen to this tape. Naader's words are from the heart and they reach out to touch your heart as well as your body. Buy this tape and use it!!",

You won't find the alien artifacts ofMission To Mars. You won't find the out-of-control robot ofRed Planet. All you'll find is believable astronauts/engineers facing the challenge of their lives, and sometimes falling short. If landing on another world and trying to build a lasting presence there isn't enough drama for you, then this is not for you. But it is for me!\"Mars Rising\" was a 6-episode companion series, a science-fact series that explored the science and technology and plans behind \"Race to Mars\". Instead of a dramatic presentation, it's a deep exploration of choices and alternatives and risks that such a mission would face. It gave me a lot of ideas for Mars stories.If you're a fan of real-world space travel, check out this double-feature. But if you want something action-oriented, look elsewhere.",

    "review/text": "One of the most haunting aspects of this movie is that my video store today has it under the \"Adult entertainment\" section which I thought was a joke. I first saw this on its release in 1988 at the age when I shouldn't have seen it. I'd forgotten so many details of it, and I was newly impressed at the film for the second time.That aside, I must say that despite the length (and a tendency for some parts to be longer than they should have been), this is a very good film. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Tomas so brilliantly, it's hard to think of him in his other familiar roles (Last of the Mohicans, for instance). Juliette Binoche is also great as Tereza Tomas wife. Supporting characters come and go, and the tone frequently changes with little warning. But those two things work perfectly within the context of the movie. Lena Olin, as Sabrina, does well on her role as a sculptor who also can find no place for love without freedom in her life. Her relationship with Tomas is based upon friendship and convenience. Their lovemaking is passionate but not empty or cold. If there is love, it is left unspoken.You can see how Teresa, Tomas and Sabina's actions flow from what they are on the *inside*: This film shows how Tomas is driven to his womanizing by his need to be 'light', and how Teresa finds this 'lightness' unbearable by her need for intimacy.Add on the absolutely mesmerizing cinematography (it acts as naturally as Teresa, Tomas, and Sabina do), and music that seems written for the movie yet is over 60 years old. This is truly a beautiful European film. Not in the ersatz 'Chocolat' style, but in the tradition of Krieslowski and Wajda. Within itself, it is a very moral film. It has a simple beauty that does not wear its heart on its sleeve, but within the wonderfully understated performances that also include Derek De Lindt and the great Stefan Skarsgaard.You can easily enjoy this film on both TV or on DVD/VHS. If you're not able see it on TV then don't hesitate to rent it or buy it.",

    "review/text": "I know it's not really fair to compare a book to a movie, and I've heard before that if you're interested in both you should always see the film first, that way you're not let down with the way it was adapted from the novel. But in this case, I read the novel first so it's impossible for me to not judge the film in that light.I don't know whether to blame the casting or the acting/direction, but I wasn't happy with any of the main characters. Daniel Day Lewis, who I normally like, plays Tomas with a constant smirk on his face that makes him hard to take seriously. In the novel, he's an intellectual, but in the movie he seems like nothing more than a confused male who's obsessed with sex.Juliette Binoche's Tereza seems like a caricature. In the book, she's a sad, somewhat innocent woman from a small Czech town. In the movie she's played like a typical French ingenue. She seems like she would fit better into Amelie than she does in Kundera's masterpiece.Lena Olin's Sabina is not as bad, but she still seems to lack the sensuality or seriousness of the character in the novel.Of course, there are many things that are left out from the book, and that is to be expected in any adaptation. The movie doesn't spend very much time on Sabina in Switzerland. The character of Franz is just glossed over, and the part about Tomas having a wife and son is completely left out, which may seem forgiveable, but in reading the book I thought the fact that Tomas had been in a failed marriage made his womanizing a little more understandable.None of this is to say that the movie is without merit. There are some spectacular scenes and moments, and it's hard not to be touched at times. But it all just feels a little rushed, even in 3 hours. This could have easily been a mini-series and perhaps then the characters could have been developed properly and the viewer would get to know Tomas and Tereza. As it is, it's a good movie that in the end comes off feeling like a slightly less erotic version of \"Last Tango in Paris.\"",

I have seen this in the theatre, on LaserDisc, and on the excellent Criterion DVD. Don't watch it full screen (4x3)!!",

    "review/text": "It's difficult not to be nostalgic now about The Unbearable Lightness of Being. This was a world in which the Soviet Union was a fact of life for hundreds of millions of people and a particular kind of culture and way of life existed. In a strange way it's initially an optimistic kind of world, and that's appropriate for what is essentially an optimistic view of human nature and love. Other reviewers have covered the jist of the tale so I won't recount it here. Suffice it to say that the young Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent as the sexually magnetic Tomas; equally important is the fact that the cinamatography is outstanding.The movie pivots around departures: first the departure of Tomas and his circle for Geneva after the Prague Spring is crushed by Russian soliders; then the departure from Geneva back to Prague that is precipitated by Teresa's loss of hope regarding her marriage. The sub-plot departure of Sabina presages the main plot departure of Teresa and both are synchronous. It's a truism that women leave, almost heedless of the wreck they cause by their departures, and the story is true to life in this regard. When Tomas follows Teresa back to Prague the movie grows dark and claustrophobic - the CCCP has imposed its iron rule and the color has gone out of the world. Little details like the removal of passports, Tomas' colleagues with their too-ready acceptance of compromises and betrayals... these small notes add layer upon layer of atmosphere, just as the small light notes of the beginning of the movie lent warmth and optimism.For someone viewing this in 2011 - especially if you've been to former Soviet Union countries - it's like stepping back in time to a world lost long ago. It wasn't a good world, but in this vignette it's intense and poignant and makes for an irresistible movie. It's heart-rending and worth every moment. Usually adaptations of books are inferior but in this case I venture the opinion that the movie is a better artistic creation than the book from which it is taken.",

    "review/summary": "Unbearable to miss, totally illuminating",
    "review/text": "This movie adaptation of Miles Kundera's book, which I haven't read yet, is a lengthy and illuminating study on freedom versus captivity, strength versus weakness as seen in the interractions between a handsome womanizing surgeon, Tomas, his lover and the woman who understands him most, the artist Sabena, and a Tereza, bright young waitress Tomas meets after performing an operation at a spa-town. Tereza shows up in Prague and unlike his character, they get married, complete with a piglet wearing a necktie whose squeals cause them to giggle uncontrollably at the ceremonyThe movie is set during the Prague Spring, that brief shining moment when a liberal communism under Alexander Dubcek's socialism with a human face, seems possible. To which Tomas mentions the ill-fated uprising in Hungary (1956). Tomas himself contrasts King Oedipus to the Soviet leaders. Oedipus couldn't bear the sight of what he had done to bring about the plagues in Thebes, so he plucked his own eyes out and left. The Soviet leaders though, were unlike Oedipus. Their defense at Stalin's crimes after his death was \"We didn't know.\" Morality also changed since Oedipus. Tomas then says that the Soviet hardliners stayed in power when they should have plucked their eyes out. He writes an article to that effect, something that will cost him dearly later.At one point, the table and glasses rumble as Tomas and Tereza are arguing. An earthquake? Tomas follows Tereza outside. The source of the tremor is then seen. Pushing its way aggressively down the alley towards them is the menacing shadow of a Soviet tank. Yes, it's 20 August 1968.A great highlight is when the picture turns to b&w; portion during the demonstration in Wencesclas Square, soldiers atop tanks, people climbing on top of them, chants of \"Dubcek\" and \"svoboda\", the fire of machine guns and people fleeing, bodies covered with Czech flags, with Tomas and Tereza in the thick of the action, marching, fleeing, or in Tereza's case, snapping pictures like mad. The scene ends dramatically with a Soviet soldier warning her, pointing his pistol at her through the lens.Sabena, and later Tomas and Tereza flee for Geneva, but things don't work out. All three journey again, the latter two back to Czechoslovakia, where under the reinforced hardliners under the thumb of Leonid Brezhnev and Gustav Husak, their part in the uprising becomes a liability.Sabena is compatible with Tomas's sex opposed to love. She asks him, \"Are you only searching for pleasure or is every a woman a new hat whose secrets you want to discover?\" She is sexually independent, strong-minded, and the mistress of her destiny. This is demonstrated when she meets Franz, a married lawyer, in Geneva. At a cafe, she comments on how music becomes noise, that even the plastic flowers are in a filled vase, and points to the building behind her as the \"uglification of the world. The only place we can find beauty is where its persecutors have overlooked it. It's a planetary process, and I can't stand it.\" She becomes Franz's lover, but when he leaves his wife to be with her, she fears for her freedom, realizes she has left one cage behind only to become prey to a different one. But ultimately, freedom leads to another cage, that of loneliness, and the lack of happiness.Tereza wants a monogamous relationship with Tomas, but finds esteem in doing something fulfilling, being a faithful wife who does her part. She can't adapt to Geneva so returns. In doing so, though, it's back to political captivity, back to a totalitarian regime, but at a lower status. If freedom/loneliness doesn't yield happiness, does that mean captivity and community yields it?Yes, there is quite a bit of sex and nudity here, but nothing gratuitous or pornographic. It's more a tasteful erotica, i.e. the much ballyhooed scenes of Sabena and Tereza photographing each other. Sabena comes off as haunted, serene, grave, at times a twinkle of mischief in the photos.Lena Olin gives the strongest performance here, exuding a strong, enigmatic, sensuous aura as the sexually independent Sabena. She would've been a strong candidate as an Oscar nominee. Praiase also to Juliette Binoche's sweet, shy, sensitive, loving Tereza, the role that boosted her to the spotlight. Daniel Day-Lewis's Tomas becomes more developed and human in the film's second half. One of those memorable movies that makes one think in depth.",

    "review/text": "\"The Unbearable Boredom of Watching.\" That's what this movie should have been titled. It is a long, relentless, punishingly dull movie following the lives of three people intertwined by a common relationship with each other. Two of them, Tomas and his mistress, Sabina, are talented yet shallow hedonists who seem to have no interest in pursuing anything greater or more meaningful than sexual gratification. Tomas' young wife, Tereza, is a sad, pathetic, naive woman who is devoted to her husband despite her knowledge of his ongoing affair with Sabina. The story takes place in the 1960's era of Communist oppression in Czechoslovakia.After spending about 3 hours watching this movie, one comes away struggling to find some meaning in it all. There were opportunities to make an interesting movie -- the tension between the women who share a common lover, the impact of Communist oppression on the lives of Tomas and his wife are but two examples -- but the writers and director chose an incredibly boring and meaningless path instead. There are several episodes of gratuitous sex, nudity, and a lengthy homoerotic scene between Sabina and Tereza that add nothing to the meaning, quality, or entertainment of this movie.I can really find no reason to recommend this movie. If you are looking for a love story or a fascinating tale about interesting people and their lives, you will be sorely disappointed. Only someone who can find meaning watching the clothes dryer at a laundromat would find this movie interesting.",

    "review/text": "This movie poses the troubling question, \"Who is more attractive: Juliette Binoche, or Lena Olin?\". For mine, Juliette is the answer, if only by a whisker (Karenin, a very charming dog, also featured in my deliberations). Of course, for those of you who are interested, old hatchet-head, Daniel Day-Lewis, is also given more than adequate screen time, and various parts of his mantis-like body are revealed, including his feet, which prove to be quite repulsive.*Kundera's book plays with philosophical concepts for primarily aesthetic purposes, and the film pragmatically dispenses with this philosophical bunting in favour of a focus upon love and desire and, with surprising resonance, upon the intrusion of public life, in the form of politics, into the private. To extract a conventional and satisfying plot from Kundera's self-conscious and theory-infected text is a credit to the screenwriters - what results is a very watchable, entirely cinematic movie, more in the Hollywood mould than the European arthouse tradition.*A large part of the film's charm lies at the feet of Juliette Binoche (as mentioned previously, Daniel Day Lewis's feet are wholly charmless). Her incredible capacity to portray joy and exuberance lights up the screen; her darker emotions are equally believable - her performance is superb, and prefigures perhaps her most astonishing role in Kieslowski's 'Blue' (a far superior film to 'Unbearable...', by the way - it's available on DVD from Amazon.co.uk). Lena Olin is suitably erotic (nice hat), and Daniel, I concede, methodically inhabits his character of Tomas, using one of his inflexible traits as an actor to effect, namely his staunch refusal to reveal himself psychically, a kind of introversion that lends Tomas much needed mystery - after all, here is a hedonist, a lothario, who is also motivated to dedicate his life to neurosurgery and, ultimately if imperfectly, to his wife, an intensely private man who refuses to yield to political pressures - you need a bit of mystery in order to reconcile the contradictions. Incidentally, all the actors, be they English, French, Swedish, or German, struggle to limp through a Czech accent - forgivable, but not ideal.*The film is long, almost three hours, and falls roughly into three parts, the last possibly being the strongest. If you wanted to give titles to these three 'chapters', you could try: 'Pornography, Exile, Love'. That would be glib, true, but if the film has a failing I think it lies somewhere in the vicinity of glibness - there is something a little too easy about its surface, and the dialogue never dares to flash light on any implied depths (in contrast, say, to Bergman, who always attempted just this, taking risks in the process - you might find yourself laughing at some of his most portentious lines, but you won't here, because Kaufman lacks the courage to disturb you).*So, worth a look, for the pretty pictures is nothing else; Criterion provide a good transfer, which you could well expect, although the actual print shows some signs of wear and tear, oddly so considering its tender age. Criterion have also lost the rights to this picture, so it is out of print as of late 2001 - so order now before Amazon runs out (other retailers already have).",

The director allows for that space in the film where we can see and feel the characters thoughts and sense their fears. There are so many wonderful scenes where Kaufman captures their innocence, their vulnerability and their cruelty of which they are unaware. As we witness all these human traits, we are suddenly taken into the sudden Communist attack on Czechoslovakia, which is the setting for this magnificent film: at that point our heroine photographs her peoples' vulnerability and reaction during a demonstration and riot against the Communist regime, in a wonderfully executed scene. There is so much to tell about the story, but I won't give it away except to mention it has one of the most well written endings in cinema!",

Daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in Prague, who cannot tolerate oppression-OR resist women, and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable. It's amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage NOT to kill each other-as they pussyfoot around the painful truth. Lena Olin (Sabina) is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hat-and one can easily love as well as hate her, as she tries to deceive the ever wise Tereza Tomas' wife (Juliette Binoche). Thumbs up to Tereza who acknowledges what Tomas cannot- as she forces him to face his weakness-and their love provides a measure of redemption. Still, it's Tomas' decision to return to Prague that results in terrible consequences. If not for the needless eroticism, this would have been a 5 star movie.",

Oh, and the background is the Prague Spring of 1968, all the way through the Soviet crackdown.Unfortunately, this is far closer to pornography than the psychological and political masterpiece that is Kundera's philosophical novel. Indeed, there is very little explanation of the characters' motivations. For example, in the book, it is clear that the doctor is both afraid of women and angry at them, having just lost his daughter in a bad divorce - it is the key to his character and there is nothing about that in the film. The same can be said of his women, however lovely they are. And the politics? It is merely events that occur as if in passing, changing their situations but with little else to say.Recommended tepidly.",

    "review/text": "I don't know what Kundera was trying to say in his book, and reading all the reviews others have written I am persuaded we are like the blind (wo)men and the elephant. Each has his or her own interpretation. I didn't like Kundera's book, I found it silly, disjointed, and boastful. Perhaps I could find some meaning in it if I set my mind to the task. I'm pretty good at assigning meaning when there is none. Perhaps the book suffered in translation. Perhaps one had to experience the coffee houses of Prague during the spring to understand.Philip Kaufman's film THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING is wonderful and awfully sad. The film is wonderful because of the three main actors: Daniel Day Lewis, Lena Olin, and Juliette Binoche. In THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING DDL plays Tomas a doctor with women on his mind--another character for his diverse vita. BEING is about beautiful young people who seem unfulfilled as human beings until it is too late. I was young and restless once--in the 1960s--and I think it's very hard to be happy when you are young. You suffer from these foolish notion that you can change the world--or you can't. You start revolutions--or you don't. Mostly, you try to figure out what the heck life is about.Tomas has frivolous things on his mind. Or does he. After all, procreation is the stuff of survival and he is just the right age to be at the mercy of his survival instincts. Does Tomas think of women too much? Is he a lothario or is he trying to find himself? I think Tomas is Tomas and you either like him or you don't. I don't think he thinks about woman more than any other man his age. If you're a woman, you get involved with Tomas or you don't. He does have a way with women. But, Tomas is not happy--he is a cynic until it is too late.Why does Tomas marry? Maybe underneath it all he wants a &quot;regular&quot; life. Or, maybe Tomas wants his cake and he wants to eat it too. Apparently, he wants a wife as he acquires one. And he wants to keep on seeing other women because he does. I am sure most of the men who saw this film and thought it was a very good film did so because they would like to be like Tomas or at least fantasize they are like Tomas. I am sure some of these very intelligent and educated men can find rationalizations for why this is a profound film.Actually, I think Philip Kaufman has his tongue in his cheek. HENRY AND JUNE (another of his films) is simply the reverse of THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING. Anais Nin wanted to have her cake and eat it too. She wanted a husband and a full range of sexual experiences with other men (and women). Apparently she did just that. Nin's diaries are much more explict than Kundera's books and good bedtime reading. Nin started a revolution--for women.I recommend HENRY AND JUNE. Uma Thurman is wonderful as June and Kevin Spacey also stars in this very funny film, though he is not Henry Miller. TROPIC OF CANCER--now there's a book they ought to ban in Boston.",

    "review/summary": "Exquisite Film Was One of The 1980's Best",
    "review/text": "Phillip Kaufman reached an artistic pinnacle with this elegant translation of Milan Kundera's book about the 1968 Czechoslovokian crisis. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Tomas, a physician, whose life consists in seducing women, one of whom - an artist Sabina (Lena Olin) - is his sexual and spiritual soulmate. Into his life comes another woman, Terezina, (Juliette Binoche) who demands more of a committment to her than he will permit to any woman including Sabina. His crisis between the carefree artist and the more demanding Terezina mirrors the crisis of Czechoslovokia between the &quot;liberation&quot; of the Prague Spring and the Soviet repression of August 1968 although neither Kauffman nor Kundera crudely makes Sabina represent the one nor Terezina the other. Although these characters may lead apparently amoral lives, the film and novel are all about the moral consequences of their choices. Many American critics, similar to the one who provided the first customer review, feel that Kaufmann has simply made a piece of arty Euro-lite soft-core: intellectual and opaque enough to appeal to the high-brow crowd yet tittliating enough to strike at their lowbrow desires. While I'll concede that this judgement applies well to his follow-up film &quot;Henry and June&quot; (1990), it's grossly unfair to characterize this film as such. The narrative and themes are presented clearly, the cinematography is gorgeous but never in an overly-arty way like in &quot;Henry and June&quot;, and his whirling direction keeps this film moving along at an effervescent 172 minutes. The actors - especially Day-Lewis and Olin - do phenomenal work and contribute mightily to bring Kaufmann's evocation of late 1960's Europe to life. In a strange way, the film compliments the book rather than adapts it and stands on its own as a fully realized cinematic work.People conditioned to see sex on the screen as a smutty joke or leading to painful reprecussions had problems with Kaufmann's playful sensuality here. He compounded their discomfort by coating all these goings-on with a veneer of class, larding the film with literary references and putting Janacek on the soundtrack. And it was easy to dismiss the film as nothing but a bunch of amoral European sophisicates who make love in between bouts of literary discussions or fighting political repression. But the film pulls us into these character's lives in a much more impassioned and alive way than European art cinema does with its deliberate distancing effects and pretentious moralizing (good recent example: Lars Von Trier's interminable &quot;Breaking The Waves&quot;). The film weaves its larger concerns about freedom and responsibility seamlessly through the narration - we can follow the film without knowing all the allusions and references. Some may see the characters and their bed-hopping as shallow and affected but they are forced to deal with their country's politics and history and have to come to terms with their own lives in ways that Euro-fluff soft-core comedies like &quot;French Twist&quot; never have to. Indeed, the moral choices placed on these apparently frivolous characters gives the film its greatness.In other words, &quot;Unbearable Lightness&quot; has a sophisticated air because it is sophisticated: in its ideas, direction, writing, and acting. Kaufmann's work since has generally disappointed but here he's made one of the richest and intelligent films of the decade.",

    "review/text": "Now this is a movie!Perhaps the most amazing thing about this film is that an American directed it. It feels so European, and not faux-European--it needs to be done this way. Or perhaps it's really not so surprising, on second thought. I've long observed how European or Europe-born directors make the best American films (Louis Malle with Atlantic City, Roman Polanski with Chinatown, even Paul Mazursky with Moscow on the Hudson), so why not the reverse?At any rate, after making a somewhat cynical American movie (The Right Stuff), Kaufman reinvented himself as his exact polar opposite, directing this relatively innocent film about the \"Prague Spring\" and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. I say \"innocent\" even though the film is best remembered (in Puritan America at least) for the explicit sex scenes that, to me, are not shocking and are not even the first thing (or second, or third) to come to mind when I think of this marvelous film. Instead I remember Sabina's hat, the quiet moments between her and Tomas, and the feeling pervading the film that life is fleeting, happiness elusive, and life-altering changes lurk around every corner. Instead I marvel at how the film manages to *suggest* the existential novel it came from, even though Kaufman chose not to try to adapt the huge existential portions of Kundera's book. This is a movie about time and place, and indentity, or lack of it; about commitment, about how heavy life seems or doesn't seem dependant upon the government you are stuck with. This is a movie about freedom, who can handle it, and who can't. This is a movie about courage, who has it and who doesn't, and I don't mean just the people who stood up on the tanks. Recall that the young and very verbal doctor who was most enthusiastic about Tomas publishing his article is quickest to turn tail and embrace the communists after the invasion.Most of all this is a movie that realizes you don't have to have a linear plot to create great film--on the contrary, film embraces such nonlinear story-telling. At the same time, Kaufman never feels compelled to venture into surrealism or symbolism. (He did consider it for the ending, as he reveals on the commentary track.) For some reason all this, and a genuine ignorance of Czech culture and history, has made this film a little tough for many American critics and viewers to swallow. They give it polite, superficial praise, but reading between the lines we get the feeling some of them are saying \"What's it *really* about, beyond great sex?\"Both Daniel Day Lewis and Lena Olin are excellent, and of course Olin's performance has received much attention and commentary because of her high-octane sex scenes (though comparisons to Last Tango seem wrong to me; LT was very cynical in is treatment of male-female relationships, whereas what makes this film work so well is the fact that it's rather innocent in that way). But the real standout--one of the greatest performances I've ever seen on a movie screen--belongs to Juliette Binoche. Her Tereza is attractive but gawky, poised by awkward, shy yet take-charge when it's needed. She is meek around Tomas yet grabs her camera and runs fearlessly into danger when the Russians invade. Binoche's performance is so astonishing we can reconcile these contradictions and in fact don't even question them. That she was never Oscar-nominated is astonishing. (This film received a grand total of two nominations and no awards--proof, if it was needed, that the Academy is retarded, considering such second-rate films as The Accidental Tourist and Rain Man took home big trophies.)Criterion's DVD is very fine, though a little short on extras. (Not even a trailer!) There are, however, fascinating commentaries by Kaufman, screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere, Lena Olin and others. I would have liked a \"Making of\" featurette too, but that's because I'm greedy. The picture is dark and solid as you'd expect from cinematographer Sven Nykvist, although on a large-screen TV you see more scratches and dust than maybe should be in such an important release. The sound very good if not THX-caliber, but this film doesn't need it.Yet another film on my favorites list that no one would dare make today. Recently this has been reissued on a double-DVD set. I haven't seen the new incarnation, but I understand from reviews the movie is *split over two discs.* While the film is longish, it can fit on one disc, as it does here. Also, the new documentary apparently contains comments from mostly the same people who are on the commentary track, so the material largely duplicates said track. Also the commentary track on the new edition is reportedly exactly the same as this Criterion edition. Given all that, I see no compelling reason to buy the new version, but I do wish someone would put out a definitive and richly detailed DVD of ULoB (how about some commentary from author Kundera?) someday.",

It is beautifully filmed, with a hypnotizing screenplay, and a tremendous cast that fully capture the essence of each of the wonderful characters they portray.It stars Daniel Day-Lewis, as Tomas, a renowned brain surgeon in Czechoslovakia(also renowned for his charms that no woman can resist)whose love for two very different women, creates a unique bonding and passionate love triangle between the three.He can never forget the beautiful and seductive Sabina(Lena Olin), who seems to know him better than any other, and yet he cannot resist the charms of his wide-eyed and childlike but serious bride, Tereza(Juliette Binoche).But when politcal upheaval, interupts his perfect life, they must flee the country, where Tereza finds she cannot continue the lightness of life that Tomas has carved out for them. He must choose now, a decision that may have him sacrificing all in the name of love.A nearly three hours, there is not a frame in this excellent piece of filmmaking that I would change.

It surrounds the room and every detail is clear and distinguishable.(The Criterion edition is in 2.0) Not much in the way of bonus features though, if that is what you are looking for. There is a theatrical trailer and it may be viewed with subtitles in English, French or Spanish. At this time I notice that Amazon is out of stock, and the merchants have some, but at very high prices. This DVD is not hard to come by. I found it at my neighborhood video store at the sugg. retail price(about half of what the sellers are asking for).This is a film to be enjoyed many times over by anyone who enjoys, romance, drama, a little comedy, and fine filmmaking.

    "review/text": "If you've read the book you won't be disappointed with this film which doesn't try to convey all Kundera's philosophy but it does retain the spirit of the book. Really the book had what some considered to be too much philosophy in it which got in the way of the story which was not Kunderas main concern anyway as his characters were just actors he used to elucidate his ideas. For Kaufman the real heart of the book was not in its ideas but in the way Tomas and Tereza relate and how that relationship evolves within a very specific historical circumstance, the Russian occupation of Prague in 68. That moment in time is really brought to life both in the cafes as we hear a Czech. version of&quot;Hey Jude&quot; being played and in the streets when the actual invasion takes place at which point hand held black and white cameras are used to give an on the spot feel to it.When we first meet Tomas(Daniel Day Lewis) he is involved with Sabina(Lena Olin)and what they share is an almost religious belief in the erotic and an equalllly strong belief in retaining their individuality and frredom. On a visit to a spa in the country to perform an operation however Tomas comes across the innocent waitress Tereza(Juliette Binoche) and his life after that is never quite the same. Sabina resents the intrusion at first but soon she and Tereza are friends, in fact the moment they become friends on a rainy afternoon taking pictures of each other is one of the best scenes in the movie. A lot is made of the historical happenings and how they affect each characters personal life. I found it a little hard to believe that they would willingly return to Prague under communist rule after they had made their escape to Zurich but you may feel differently. The use of the terms &quot;lightness&quot; and &quot;weight&quot; that so often appeared in the book always seemed to my ears rather vague, the movie gratefully only employs those terms on rare occasion. The last scenes in the countryside are some of the most beautiful cinematography I have seen, quite memorable images evoking the really valuable things in life.Certainly one of the best adaptations of a novel.",

    "review/text": "This is one of my favorite movies. Philip Kaufman did an excellent job of translating the novel into film, and the acting is top-notch as well. The performances are strong, and some of the more philosophical elements of the novel are incorporated without creating the awkwardness that might have resulted in the hands of a less-capable director.The biggest surprise was the strong European feel of the film. (Yes, the film was set in Europe - specifically, Prague and Geneva - but American movies shot on location are usually still identifiably American.) The film's portrayal of the sexual relationships in the story is remarkably mature - not something you'd expect from an American film.The quality of the DVD transfer is vastly superior to the laserdisc. It was particularly gratifying to be able to watch the film in one sitting, without interruptions, and without having to change discs halfway through. The additional commentary is good, though the commentary from the wonderful Lena Olin seems slightly out of place amongst the more technical commentary of Philip Kaufman and the others involved.The only drawback to this particular edition is the sound. While the sound quality is excellent, the volume is markedly quieter than that of the other DVDs I've bought so far.",

You would either have to be clinically dead or so engulfed in film-critique snobbery and technical objectivism (ah, we Americans are so mesmerized by that European chic and intrigue aren't we!) to not be moved by this film. For those who can't handle the erotic overtones, the &quot;shallowness&quot; (I completely disagree here) or can't get around Tomas' womanizing -- it's your loss. The emotions in this movie are far from shallow, it's just that this film refuses to be blatant about them in a typical Hollywood tug-at-your-heartstrings fashion. While the dialogue may seem cold and distant at times, the character's facial expressions (be they blank or not) always manage to betray their innermost thoughts and vulnerabilities.Of course, this movie will appear slow and drawn out to anyone not accustomed to anything but &quot;Armadeggon&quot; and &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, but I never found it dull. This is one of the most beautiful, human films I've ever come to know.",

    "review/text": "I feel i should write something because the previous review is very misleading and spiteful. I always find it bizarre when people write a review of a film and say &quot;nothing much happened&quot;. Well, did you watch the film? A lot happened! The Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia for one thing! The previous reviewer calls the movie self-important. It is no more self-important than the review you wrote, sir. And if it is, I think that tends to happen naturally when a conglomeration of hugely talented filmmakers tackle epic material; it is gorgeously lensed by the greatest cinematographer of all time Sven Nykvist, the performances are peerless, the script is utterly compelling at all times, and the direction proved Kaufman to be a master. I don't find the film pretentious because i found the story so involving. I was watching characters not dry literary symbols. I personally believe something is pretentious only if you dont understand it. As for the cactus being a phallic symbol, it looks a phallus, so what? Whats your point? As for the title, my mother, who is Slavic and was living in Poland during the 1968 invasion, agrees that Teresa explains it best in the film: she can't bear to be light and frivolous while her people are being oppressed. I have seen few films that display the heart and warmth of this one. It is just as timely and compelling today as it was twelve years ago. The Criterion DVD has beautiful high resolution imagery and a great Janacek soundtrack. The commentary track is also enlightening to hear, as several key people involved in making the film speak candidly about what they were doing.",

    "review/text": "Do yourself a favor and read Kundera's book to fully appreciate the nuances of this movie, things like what \"lightness\" stood for (freedom of self and sexual expression). With such liberties staunchly repressed under the dictat of the former Soviet Union, sexual expression becomes a cry for freedom within itself. The movie is erotic, yes, but it carries a whiff of mischief rather than being purposeless, gratuitous \"softporn\" as some reviewers lament.Daniel Day-Lewis is pretty decent as Tomas, toggling between a brain surgeon and a Lothario. His performance is disciplined and understated as events overtake Tomas's ability to control his destiny. He has an arrangement with Sabina (Lena Olin), a sculptor who also can find no place for love without freedom in her life. Their relationship is based upon friendship and convenience. Their lovemaking is passionate but not empty or cold. If there is love, it is left unspoken.Kaufman uses this relationship as the foundation of the movie with most of the dynamic being centered upon the naive country girl (a very fresh and intriguing Juliette Binoche) who rebels against the crushing of the Prague Spring by photographing the brutality.The trio escape to Switzerland. Geneva then plays a major role in this film as being emblematic of an alternative freedom; a freedom that feels heavy with responsibility. Maybe, within western democracy, when everybody has a voice, then the individual can no longer be heard. Maybe, if there are no small victories, then there is no true lightness. Their freedom can only be felt within context.Finally, Thomas and Tereza return home to a Soviet Prague. Again, via censure, the communists provide the answer.Sabina finds a beach side property in California, opting for bland airbrushed seascapes. She lives alone. Her spirit has been quelled by the freedom that surrounds her.This is truly a beautiful European film, perhaps not too palatable to Hollywood-tainted tastes. Despite its length (which does tend to drag a little) and its erotic texture, I believe it follows its own moral vein.A thought provoking dash of cinema, highly recommended for any connoisseur's collections!",

We may use it one minute to discover some divine truth...next minute we rationalize a decision to satify an ego need.Is this highbrow? The ability to articulate does not a saint make. Besides, any discussion of morality is purely relative (Why don't people understand this - their is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; there is however acting in accordance w/spiritual law and not) People w/ the guts to live life and share their experience w/others are fascinating. Beats sitting out in a salt flat wishing I did not subvert all my drives into cravings for doughnuts.READ THE TITLE!!! Life is so wonderfully simple...but so damn hard to do! This movie is about simply &quot;being&quot;. Being human. The depth of the characters draws you in. They draw you in because they act on there &quot;human&quot; impulses not because they are georgeous. Not being familiar w/ the time or place of the movie, it just kinda washed over me but kept me riveted the whole time.Some lives are simple and boring like those in Salt Lake City or those of the waitress character. Through circumstance lives do change and life can become adventurous and exciting. It's all part of being human. It does not make one person better than another.This movie takes you through the lives and interactions of 3 people (compellingly). That is it!! What truly brings this movie together is the final scene. The beautiful simplicity of a perfect evening spent w/wonderful friends. They were so engrossed in &quot;Being&quot;...This is hard to articulate.The feeling I got after the final scene was crushing and then it was all clear. The simple beauty in &quot;I've never been so happy&quot;...then *BOOM*...Everyone who has seen this remembers exactly what they were doing at the time...am I right?..like as if that was the realization that these 2 soulmates had incarnated to experience and then they could be freed from this life. Gorgeously painful. My heart compressed and then burst open. I wailed in anguish. I realized myself lost I become in the details of life and I was ashamed for overlooking what I felt at that moment, the true essence. This scene is truly sublime.They had done all this living but had allowed themselves to become distracted from the point of it all. Fantastic ending...perfect.We really do take life too seriously people. We are so busy analyzing it and expecting things that we overlook the magic that it is to just be alive. The Unbearable Lightness is divinely inspired. Pray for those who get lost in the details...this movie will surely be lost on them.",

    "review/text": "The Unbearable Lightness of Being is one of those occasional attempts by American filmmakers to make a European arthouse movie in English, in this case taking on an `unfilmable' novel and trying to solve the problem of turning inner monologue into a credible narrative. Despite, or perhaps because of Jean-Claude Carriere's presence as co-writer with director Philip Kaufman, this tends to take the form of the odd conversation between shags rather than an attempt to turn ideas into images, leaving a rather conventional narrative about a philandering surgeon who ultimately needs the oppression of the Russian invasion rather than the freedom of the Czech Spring to focus his emotional commitments and principles. Some of this is done well, some of it less well, but at the end of the day it's just a love story, although it deals well with the personal consequences of the political crackdown and the ending is quietly moving. Which, in a way, reflects some kind of emotional triumph - whereas for most of the film we don't really care for the characters, merely go along with them, by the end, like he hero, we have at least attained some genuine level of emotional commitment.Whether that entirely justifies 171-minutes of screen time is debatable, though in its defense the film never feels that long. There are moments that grate, not least the sporadically clumsy integration of the main characters into archive footage of the Russian invasion that draws attention to itself by the crude device of adding scratches only to the new footage. The photography session doesn't quite work either despite an interesting start, not quite pulling off the shift of power and veering off into self-indulgence. The performances are slightly problematic too, especially with the Czechs limited to the smaller supporting roles in an Anglo-French-Swedish-American cast leading to a variety of composite accents (often more Germanic than Slav) and a feeling that the casting directors thought \"Yeah, he sounds foreign, he'll do\" at times. Daniel Day Lewis fares well as the coldly charismatic and fickle doc but still hadn't shrugged off that well-trained British stage actor feel to his performances; Juliette Binoche is genuinely appealing in one of her more open performances, although it's a bit of a stretch that her character never loses her naivet&eacute;; but as the more passionate of his loves Lena Olin is somewhat more problematic, her performance getting less convincing as the film progresses until rediscovering its humanity in her final scene. Of the supporting players, Erland Josephon has one good scene as a former ambassador reduced to being a janitor that underlines the way that even love and sex can be used as weapons of political oppression merely through the introduction of doubt - an idea that becomes strangely more powerful because of the way Kaufman frequently fails to summon up much in the way of eroticism because he generally regards sex as joyfully comic.Annoyingly the film has been split across two discs, although the break isn't quite as abrupt as on some other discs. The DVD boasts a good transfer with an interesting audio commentary and good half hour documentary that illustrates that even if they didn't entirely succeed at least the filmmakers were trying to create something of real substance.",

But this is the general question.Can men sleep with multiple partners but love only one woman? This is like the Madonna/Whore syndrome. Teresa was the Madonna, the only man she ever slept with was Tomas. Then there was Sabina - she was Tomas' lover before and after his marriage to Teresa. But Sabina and Tomas were alike, irrespective of their gender differences.There is one scene which took place when Tomas, Teresa and Sabina became ex-patriates in Switzerland. Teresa came to Sabina's studio/home. Teresa became sensitized to the fact that Tomas had been with Sabina - while Teresa is taking pictures of Sabina, tears roll down Teresa's face. Sabina takes the camera and starts taking pictures of Teresa. She makes Teresa take off her clothes. Eventually they end up on the floor - if Sabina's Swiss lover had not come in, I think that Sabina would have made love to Teresa in a soft, gentle way. But the innocent Teresa jumped up, naked, to run away as she became aware of her nakedness.I like movies about human nature and interactions. This movie pulls one into a story and makes one forget their surroundings. I feel that is a mark of a good storymaker.",

True, it is almost impossible to find a movie that resembles so much to the book in every detail and in addition is able to promote and bring the same feelings, ideas and messages. However, in this case the movie follows the greatness of the book and I am finally able to say that. The lines that are drawn in the book which captures different angles of the character's life, are very well interpreted and portrayed in the movie. It is a very long movie, but there is always a reason behind it. It is impossible to understand the message of the book, without capturing every story, analyzing it and break it down into details. I don't know much of Philip Kauffman's career, but I have read the book and I have seen the movie many times, and I can assure you that the movie has achieved it's goal. Daniel Day-Louis is superb because he has portrayed its character-Tomaz so unbelievebly well. Tomaz, the famous and respected neurosurgeoun which is part of the high intellectual class in Prague, ends up becoming a janitor cleaning windows and later on a farmer. This is how light life is, our exsitence as human beings. Is it for love, due to political circumstances at the time or just living reality to the fullest? And realizing how light our life is, we try in any way to make it more meaningful without realizing that it can be so, only if we want it to be so. Juliette Binoche(French) and Lena Olin(Swedish) are incredible and amazing. The characters are terribly hard to interpret, yet they reached the character's uniqueness and gave a great performance. It is a movie on life and how we live it. A great movie with a special European Cinema touch. If you have never seen the movie, please do watch it because you are missing a good lesson on life understanding. I assure you that you will be fulfilled and maybe ready to start reading the book right after watching the movie.",

The film has a well deserved R rating for scenes of nudity and sex which I think were unnecessary and prevent a wider range of audience from seeing the film. I greatly hope that the producers would offer a version of the film witht he nude and sex scenes cut so that it could be shown in history classes in school.There is also a scene that Beatles fans may like where the song \"Hey Jude\" is sung in the Czech language. It also has many pieces of music by Czech composer, Leos Janacek.The DVD also has audio commentary by the director Philip Kauffman, Editor, Walter Murch, Co writer John Carri&egrave;re, and Actress Lena Olin.",

    "review/text": "There are so many great reviews here that spell out in detail what this film covers that I will not take that approach. Instead, I wish to say that I never thought I would particularly care for this film; thought it was probably just another excuse for nudity and would be in poor taste. This is definitely a misconception...This film is absolutely beautiful. I was never offended in any way about anything that was depicted in it and believe every scene necessary to show the pattern of the times they portray and the characters as the individuals they were supposed to be. I did find the sequence of the two women posing for each other a little strange. The camera shots of the constant eye movement reminded me of the movie \"Once Upon A Time In The West\". But the use of real film footage, especially that of the Soviet invasion, is excellent and I love the extra feature offered of the film portrayed with commentary. You learn so much about the history and the desire of those producing the film and what they are trying to convey as well as what they went through to be able to offer this film to us. You will notice that many of the reviews here are pretty lengthy. That is because this is truly a very thought-provoking film. I feel silly at this point to mention it, but there are several reviews here that question (out of all that is presented here) the hair under the armpit. I was told this was a very common practice in the European countries. I don't know if it still is or not, but many Europeans found it very natural and quite arousing as part of their sexual foreplay. They thought it ridiculous that we Americans felt the need to shave it. On my first visit to Europe, I was very young, but noticed this feature about women many times and thought it \"icky\". Then I questoned it and was informed as I mentioned above. However, I still find this unattractive but can't totally figure out why.If you think you are a little prudish and won't like this film, think again. Please do yourself a favor and watch this fantastic, erotic film. It is about so much more than just sex. I love this cast. Their talent is phenomenal. The women are beautiful of course, but Day-Lewis exudes a sensuality that makes his character a believably charming womanizer who, nevertheless, adores his wife. I'm so glad I bought this film. I've watched it many times and will continue to do so. It's hard to imagine that a young, brilliant brain surgeon should be reduced to washing windows because he would not sign statements condoning the communistic philosophy. We are so fortunate to live in this country even with all the faults we are told about every day. Thank God for our Freedom and our wonderful men and women who have fought to keep it for us.",

This led me to the great adventure of all of Kundera's work, and he quickly became one of my favorite writers. I rewatched this again recently and was much more impressed this time around. Day-Lewis is perfect as Tomas, the sardonic Lothario. Olin is blood-boiling as Sabina, the incarnation of freedom. And Binoche is captivating as Terersa, the woman for whom Tomas gives up everything. This a stirring, heartbreaking movie. The only problem is that it lacks Kundera's inimitable *voice*, the witty, erudite mini-essays he uses to iluustrate his philosophical points. Kaufman tries to recapitulate that voice in one or two lines of dialogue, but is doesn't work as well. By all means, see this fine film. But don't miss Kundera's original classic.",

    "review/text": "Many of us know people (or are those people ourselves) who move through life lightly, never taking too much too seriously. This film explores what happens when people treat each other lightly, when there is an imbalance of attachment between people, when couples' definitions (of love, sex, commitment, etc.) are unequal: Which person is self-centered, selfish even, and which one bears most of the emotional weight? Whose interests does the couple tend to nurture the most, and who's ideas are often left unexplored until they wither away?The film is a period piece that pits the free expression of sex in 1960s Prague against the backdrop of Communist Russia. When the Soviet army invades Prague in 1968, the film truly begins, presenting a parallel love story and war story. This structuring is intentional. You'll have to decide for yourself how the alternating settings of the film work with the changing relationships of the film's protagonists. While I think the movie does well with the period and settings, any extremism (from the left or right) seems to me the antithesis of freedom.The three main characters form a triangle that is often found in film noir, but this triangle is more complicated. The three begin the film under the guises of traditional noir types: Tomas (Daniel Day-Lewis) is the great leading man and scoundrel; Tereza (Juliette Binoche) is the adorable nurturing woman; and Sabina (Lena Olin) is the insatiable and ever-fleeting femme fatale. Once put in motion, however, these character types begin to wobble, although the triangle remains intact throughout the majority of the film.The nudity and sex scenes in the film are quite explicit and are European in their cinematic representations of the body and of sex. Aside from a few scenes of over-the-top zooming, the cinematography is spectacular, especially in scenes with mirrors. It might be worth noting that the film is nearly three hours long and requires some patience to watch. The characters are developed deeply while the plot moves slowly. The 2006 version of the DVD contains a making-of featurette in which you can learn more about how controversial the film was, and in some ways, still is.",

He also cannot sustain this lightness and leaves Geneva to go back to the Communist dominated Prague(Post Prague Spring).

The irony of the film's title incorporates this attitude, contrasting it with the \"heaviness\" of everything else that life throws at you. Its message is perhaps (I'm guessing) that even when we are happy, and life is refreshingly `easy,' we tend to gravitate to that which will undo this, that which will put us into turmoil and confrontation; we simply can't bear to be happy for too long, for fear that the happiness itself will turn against us, never to be experienced again.As for the film itself, it's very good. Daniel Day Lewis, Juliette Binoche, and Lena Olin (wow!) are incredible. What they do between lines is a lesson in fine acting.Why four stars?

    "review/text": "Based faithfully on the book by Milan Kundera, a non-political Lothario doctor in Prague in 1968 comes to grips with two things in his life: his love for one woman and a commitment to the political uprising in his homeland. Because of the latter he is no longer allowed to practice medicine and is forced to live on a farm in poverty. His love for the woman, too, has been put to the test, yet he sticks with her, even though it means returning to his country after being given exile in France.The themes are intelligent and interesting, but the development is too slow: the movie is much too long at nearly 3 hours. Scenes seemed to be dragged out interminably, especially those in Paris as he weighs his conscience regarding his love and his homeland, and near the end on the farm. Because of this the movie as a whole seems to lack focus. But this is compensated for in the story's interest. The sex scenes are very sensual. Worth a watch.",

That it's an existentialist discourse on being and happiness? Yes it is all those things, and others have said plenty along those lines. But it really makes the film sound a lot more boring than it actually is, for this is one of those rare films where you actually become interested in, and sometimes are even moved by, the fate of the characters.At 170 minutes the film is long, but never tedious. Those of you who really hate long films can watch this in 2 sittings - the sequence dealing with the Soviet invasion of Prague is the natural divider. (BTW I was quite impressed by how seamlessly the main characters were weaved into actual documentary footages.) The story is intense, but not ponderous. The plot unfolds at a leisurely pace allowing the viewer to soak in the stunning imageries, while the story was engrossing enough to make you forget the passage of time. The acting, btw, was superb. Juliet Binoche really shines in this one though I didn't find her other roles that memorable. Daniel Day-Lewis allegedly suffered a nervous breakdown after making this film, although you can't tell from his stolidly understated performance.This is a deep film, and not just because somebody compared Brezhnev to Oedipus Rex. Charges of &quot;shallowness&quot; really say more about the viewer than the film. It does not wear its depth on its sleeves and does not pound its &quot;message&quot; into you with a 2X4. But it lingers in the back of your mind and makes you think twice at the odd moment.Finally, labels such as &quot;pseudo-intellectual&quot; shouldn't be chugged around like a grenade.

    "review/text": "I've always felt it is a mistake to compare a film adaptation to its literary counterpart. The Unbearable Lightness of Being, as a novel, is hugely significant and wonderful. As a film, it is not necessarily true to the book and that is solely because as a film it is not capable of being true to the book. I would compare making a movie out of Milan Kundera's novel to making a video game out of the Godfather or Pulp Fiction. If that was done we run into issues like forgetting to include the priorities of game play, or simply cashing in on the success of the film. With the Unbearable Lightness of Being, there are inevitably going to be lovers of the book waiting to attack the film, and that has happened. Of course it prioritizes itself efficiently as a cinematic experience, while at the same time it makes for about as good an adaptation of the novel as you can possibly get. It wasn't a filmable story to begin with and even Kundera came forward and said that, but he also consulted the writers of the screenplay. So comparisons between the film and novel are in my opinion pointless but also inescapable. I've already made them myself.I'm not going to summarize the whole film for you as that would probably be too long-winded and could potentially spoil the story. I'll introduce the characters, place them in a setting and then say go...and then you can add this to your shopping cart, proceed to check out, and then a few days later press play. The film takes place in Prague in 1968 just after Alexander Dubcek lead the Prague Spring advancement. Soon after that the characters suffer through further reform following the eventual invasion of the Soviets and the Warsaw Pact. The film opens with two characters who are lighthearted and carefree lovers. Tomas is a surgeon and womanizer who lives life as though sex and love are two very different things. Sabina is an artist who, in the eyes of Tomas, embodies sex. Tomas soon meets the more heavyhearted Thereza, a waitress and aspiring photographer, who embodies innocence. They are opposites but soon Thereza will also embody love in the eyes of Tomas.The characters in The Unbearable Lightness of Being evolve wonderfully in a significant and chaotic backdrop, but they never steer from their passions. It is layered as not only a romance, but also as a story about rebellion, and as an erotic dance; but ultimately it is an existential story. A few of these points are strengths only realized if the book is read first. Not that I'd definitely recommend doing that if you haven't already, as the book does stand higher in it's own medium than the film does and you may be setting yourself up for disappointment. Some of the deeper messages are unquestionably somewhat muted in the film.Again though, judged solely as a cinematic narrative, Director Phillip Kauffman makes The Unbearable Lightness of Being a beautiful movie and delves deeply enough into these characters and their world that he manages to capture some of Kundera's vision, while adding his own motion picture flare. I'm conflicted as to whether this movie should be celebrated as a triumph in terms of Kundera's novel, but I'm not conflicted in the least as to whether or not this is a great movie all by itself.",

The backdrop is perfect for a love story, thier problems as a couple gain perspective next to the prospects going on, they both support the cause, and pay the price of being dissadents, which brings them closer together. It has a completley epic feel. It describes a couple, thier circle, the Country, politics and time perfectly. I don't want to give anything away.

    "review/text": "\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" is a film from 1988 made by director Phillip Kaufman that caught my attention at a store due to it's unusual title. The film was in the new release section due to the recent two-disc special edition and the film's title stuck in my head for a couple of weeks and I finally decided to rent it. After reading the synopsis and seeing the actors that were in it, I knew I would like it...I was unaware, however, of just how much I would like it. This movie isn't really my kind of movie. I like independent films and watch them quite a bit, but as far as plot and everything this isn't my ideal film. To give you a quick example, my favorite movie is \"Pulp Fiction\" and some movies appearing in my top 30 would be (not in this order) American Beauty, Crash, Million Dollar Baby, and Blue Velvet. But, after just a few minutes shy of three hours after I began this movie I was amazed. This movie transfixed me, I loved every single solitary second of it.Roger Ebert called this movie \"the best serious erotic film since Last Tango in Paris\" which I feel is pretty much accurate. None of the actors in this movie are Marlon Brando, but I feel this movie was better. The performances by all three main actors (Daniel Day-Lewis, Lena Olin, and Juliette Bincoche) are spectacular, but don't seem that way immediately. It's when you compare all their performances to this performance that it clicks. I'm not saying that each actor puts on their best performance in this movie, only that...Well, you've caught my drift hopefully. Another aspect I loved about this movie was it's dialouge, which is nothing short of spectacular. It's not Quentin Tarantino-quick witted, fast tongued like dialouge. It's not the kind of movie where you really even notice that the dialouge stands out, but there were lines in this film that were great. I couldn't tell you a single one right now, but there were a few times when I thought to myself \"that was a great line.\" Also, I was amazed to find out (via this website) that Phillip Kaufman (director and co-adaptor of the film) is American, because this movie seems to be filmed by a foreign director. That might not make sense to some people, but it does have that kind of aura to it. The movie stars Day-Lewis as Tomas, a womanizing surgeon who lives in Prague. The man is brilliant at convincing woman to do what he wants them to do, which is detailed in a very funny opening scene. With the words \"take off your clothes\", he gets exactly what he wants. But Tomas is seemingly incapable of loving another person, but he does enjoy sex. Sex isn't a way of showing love, but is instead mere entertainment. Luckily, he has a partner that feels the same way. This partner is Sabina (Olin) a young woman, who is pretty much a female version of Tomas. One day, Tomas is sent to another town to perform an operation where a woman catches his eye. Tomas follows her and when he catches up with her, he meets Tereza (Binoche). Tereza is the polar opposite of Sabina. While Sabina is comfortable with her body, open to love-less sex, and composed.Tereza is uncomfortable with nakedness, sex, and is a bit child like in her manner. For some reason, Tomas is attracted to her and marries her while still carrying on his affair with Sabina, who has met a man named Franz who might finally be the one. Then the story takes a different turn, when the Russian invasion occurs in Prague and Tomas and Tereza end up in Switzerland, where Sabina happens to be as well. The cinematography during the scenes of the Russian invasion is very good, it first turns to black & white and then a grainy color. But, there's about as much of the synopsis I can give...Now, I'll begin my thoughts on the performances. As I said they're all great, but Olin is the best in the movie. I've seen her in several movies before and can not think of a single one and I was amazed to find out she was born in 1955, making her 51 today and 33 when this movie was made. Olin was (is) perfect for this role, as she has both the acting skills and the sexuality and body needed for the role to be believable. Day-Lewis is great, as always. It's interesting to watch My Left Foot, this film, and Gangs of New York and see how he completely embodies a character rather than just plays them. Then there's Binoche, I have several pros and really only one con with her. She catches the child like quality, yet strong will of the character Tereza brilliantly, she should've got an Oscar nomination for this movie at least (and for all I know, she might have). But, during one of the \"sex\" scenes involving her (in the rest of them, I could barely tell) she has a fairly large abundance of armpit hair. This is just me, but that's not very attractive and when you see the other women that Tomas hooks up with or almost hooks up with in this movie, you have to wonder what was he thinking. Before this review becomes ridiculously long, I need to add that not everyone will like this movie half as much as I did. In fact, a lot of people won't like it at all. It's 168 minutes without the end credits annnd combines so many plot elements, that it bored a lot of people. One person on Amazon said they should've called it \"The Unbearable Boredom of Watching\". So, technically I recommend this movie highly; but don't take my word for it. Hopefully my review will lead you to conclude whether you should watch this movie or waste your time on something else. Either way, this is my grade for it: A",

Poetic, haunting, subtle, and terribly sad, it says more about the crushing impact of repressive (i.e. communist) regimes than a thousand documanteries or inflammatory speeches could tell. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. More surprisingly, it is a heartbreaking romance. Like a great novel, ULOB grows on you, and you'll hate to see the characters leave you at the end. Perfectly acted by its then unknown leads, and beautifully photographed, this is a film to grow old with.",

The film's breadth and depth of each character, the larger-than-life issues played out against the seeming frivolity of the Prague Spring--and its tragic historic aftermath--never fail to impress me. This film has a very European sentiment regarding sexuality/sensuality, however; it is as woven into the fabric of daily life as a glass of fine wine.

    "review/text": "Philip Kaufman's \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" is an exceptional adaptation of Milan Kundera's equally provocative novel of the same title. The film explores the \"lightness\" of freedom without consequence versus the \"weight\" of responsibility that may bring greater reward. As the title suggests, the main character reaches a point when the lightness of his life becomes an unbearable burden.The film translates this philosophy through three main characters living in 1968 Prague during the Russian invasion. Tomas, brilliantly played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is a surgeon living a very free, sexual, and uncomplicated life. He enjoys an open relationship with voluptuous Sabine (Lena Olin in her best performance to date), an artist who values her \"lightness\" more than Tomas. Tomas and Sabine meet conveniently for passionate encounters and seem to have a comfortable understanding of one another. Their relationship is so amenable that Sabine agrees to mentor Tereza, a young impetuous waitress (played by Juliette Binoche) who has run away to Prague to live with a skeptical Tomas.Tomas first appears amused and detached; he moves from woman to woman with a smile and ease. Over the course of the film, we watch his behavior change as he begins to question his feelings. While he marries Tereza, he continues his extra-marital relationships as Tereza suffers and struggles to understand his needs. She questions, \"How can you make love and not be in love?\" Her inability to accept and change her position forces Tomas to reconsider his behavior.Against the backdrop of the invasion, these characters struggle with the complexity of their feelings and needs, often confused, frustrated, and heart-breaking. This is an adult film filled with many sensually choreographed scenes. We quickly realize that Sabine represents pure sex, Tereza pure love, and Tomas is wrestling with the two.However, it is unfair to characterize this well-edited film as a simple love triangle. The film integrates real footage from the 1968 invasion into the characters' story. Tereza uses her new skills to photograph her beloved Prague and its resistance. Her photos are confiscated and used to identify sympathizers; she herself is arrested. This leads to difficult and live-changing decisions that impact Tomas as well. Sabine wrestles with her own conscience to choose between lightness and weight. This film handles the unbearable lightness of being beautifully and skillfully; it is an excellent film.",

Fans will rave about this release, detractors will still say it does no justice to a superior novel, and most, like me, will fall somewhere in between. What did amaze me was how much better this movie looked on DVD than on the old VHS full-screen copy I have. In widescreen there's much more to see, and the scenery is a big part of this film, particularly during the tense moments between Tereza and the Soviet soldiers when life and death hung in the balance over possession of a camera.As for the actual movie:For those who don't know, this is the motion picture version of Czech writer Milan Kundera's novel about a libertine doctor, his wife, mistress, and their lives in Prague before, during, and after the Soviet crackdown of 1968. This is film that has its fair share of sex and nudity but it is one that never quite becomes as erotic as it is supposed to be or wishes it was. The Unbearable Lightness of Being is noteworthy because of fine performances by Daniel Day Lewis, Lena Olin, and Juliette Binoche, but to me and others who came of age after the Cold War, it seems a period piece rather than the revelation it probably was a generation back. It's no masterpiece, but it is a good film.",

I rented the film to watch my favorite Juliette Binoche and was pleasantly astonished (surprised is a too weak word for it) by the film as a whole. After I saw here how brainwashed by KGB the Westerners are, it was amazing to see the film done by Westerners with such a deep understanding of the reality behind the \"iron curtain\". It brilliantly showed how the dissidents, \"normal\" people just like you and me, with all their passions, weaknesses and imperfections were up against ruthless and powerful killing machine. - Especially clear in the scenes where Czech's puppet branch of KGB sends its \"James\" and \"Jane\" \"Bonds\" to discredit the main characters(and also pit against each other) by seducing them. All the \"eroticism\" of the film just serves the purpose to show how \"humane\" the dissidents were. They are no heroes, they knew that they will be crushed but it was just unbearable for them (as truthful to themselves people) to take it anymore(hence the title of the film). Unfortunately none of it was mentioned in the comments, in fact most people don't even see this film as political. And for those who still don't get it: yes, it wasn't an accident in the end, the main characters were murdered.",

The film is a masterpiece in many ways, cinamatographically, emotionally, sexually. It makes the viewer reflect upon thier own decisions and actions in ways no other films can.

More than anything it is always, always a great pleasure to watch. The characters are so genuine and well-rounded, that although they are tremendously diverse you care about not one, not two, but all of them.Beautifully shot and edited with what appear to be real photos and footage from the time in which it's set, I would recommend it to anyone. It has not aged a day.I can count on one hand the examples of a film adaptation where the film really adds to the legacy of a piece, and equals or even transcends the power of the book. And that's saying a lot in this case because the book is also something to be experienced!",

End of story, until she shows up at his door in Prague to continue the conversation. Great opening, but soon I couldn't help but wonder why these two oddball Berlin Wall era ambiguous revolutionaries are so madly in love with each other. We are told that repeatedly, and a marriage union locks the deal, but they seem about as chemically inclined towards one another as a bland peanut butter and jelly sandwich; there for the sake of being. But they are, apparently, the Scarlet and Rhett of the fall of The Soviet Empire, helplessly involved in a Cold War deadlock with Russians who are revealed as typically sitting at a long table in a bar, kicking back vodkas, and behaving like Boris and Natasha from The Bullwinkle cartoons. Come on, really? Lena Olin's nude exhibition with a tophat was a pretentious symbol of democratic freedom, and the potboiler romance and revolution is forever on a low simmer, when it needs to be boiling over. If the film would have stopped when Juliette Binoche shows up unexpectedly at Daniel Day Lewis's door, and they made wild rebellious graphic sex defying all conventions for the duration of the film, (no top hats please, that is SO Al Pacino 'Cruising'), this cold war wouldn't have been so frigid.",

Its title is pretentious and essentially empty, and thus an excellent match for the movie, but if I were to name it a little more honestly, a better variation on the theme would be &quot;The Unbearable Self-Importance of Being...Philip Kaufman&quot;. Nothing seemingly happens or is displayed for much rhyme or reason, but then how could it...that would defeat the purpose. The characters are hateful and frankly rather ridiculous (unintentionally, to be sure). When I'm in the mood for a caricature of a womanizer, I'll fire up a Happy Days episode or two and watch the Fonz go at it in style, thanks. And as much as I like Lena Olin and Daniel Day-Lewis (though I certainly wouldn't, if I were judging them on the basis of this movie alone), their performances are extremely over-rated and surprisingly sub-par, and the horribly mangled accents are distracting. Juliette Binoche is the only one, in my opinion, deserving of praise for her performance (her accent also notwithstanding, mind you). If you like the female human body, you'll enjoy this film for its visceral qualities in that respect...they are certainly very nice. As for the film itself, if you like low-IQ artsy stylism like cactii as phallic symbols, incohesive dialog, and morally bankrupt parodies of characters that make decisions and live their life as if it really were a film (ie. a couple of hours long and with an audience), then you may well enjoy it as much as the ranks of lemmings who extoll this pretentious waste of celluloid's virtues and do the majority of intelligence-burdened film buyers a disservice. As for the DVD itself, it comes with no extras, the picture quality is poor and the sound is only available in Dolby 2.0, not 5.1., so it comes up short technically as well.

    "review/text": "After the problems with the Hrabal text in I served the King of England (see my review), Kundera suffers a similar fate. Lets start with quoting the beginning of the Wikipedia review, which sets the scene as follows: \"The Unbearable Light-ness of Being is a 1988 American film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Milan Kundera, published in 1984. Director Philip Kaufman and screenplay writer Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re show Czechoslovak artistic and intellectual life during the Prague Spring of the Communist period, before the Soviet and Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968, and detail the moral-political effects and personal consequences upon a bohemian m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois: a medical doctor and his two women.\"This is definitely not the Kundera of his many books, and Jean-Claude Carri&egrave;re, else an excellent script writer with/for eg Bu&ntilde;uel's last six films or so, must have gotten too much under Kaufman's thumb or not have given a damn once he saw where things were going, but must certainly have been paid well. What we more generally have is a money no problem fashion product by a fashion director with international staff. The Czechoslovak atmosphere of 1968 caught by a film-crazy, unrealistically brave youngster (some would call her dumb and stupid), and while most locations would be authentic, the film has nothing Czech about it. It could have been anywhere, mostly New York, the revolt probably in Chile.I have not found any review of the film by Kundera himself, but knowing his work, I would expect that his comments were not kind. After a positive (but rather shallow and uneducated, very American) first review in the Criterion Collection by Michael Sragow (1/11/1999), twelve years down the line, Mark Lova (31/1/2011), in a very clear analysis, sums up the arguments \"It's a good question: Why care what Kundera says? I did assume that some people would care. I think if you want to do more than be a consumer of art, if you think that movies and books are not just things you use once and then throw away, you should care too. Obviously, you might like the book, and not care about the film, or you might like the film, not the book. (etc.) However, if you care about the book, you might at least wonder what Kundera was complaining about.\"Where does that leave me? As I have expressed elsewhere at some stage, I do not like falsifications, and Kaufman's film to me clearly falls into that category. If you already refer to the author and title of the original book, you should show more respect - or is it simply skill (as opposed to money)?62-12 February 2012",

He is struggling to adapt to civilian life and hold onto his relationship with his wife when she is abducted in a bank robbery.As his life crumbles and the police seem less interested in recovering his wife, he goes the vigilante route, tracking, interrogating and diving into dangerous situations, ultimately leading him to Las Vegas where he uncovers a large scale plot that is bigger than he or anyone could ever imagine.Other than the fact that my script is more complex and has better dialogue, the biggest difference between my script and THE MARINE is that the lead character in my script is REAL. A real, flesh and blood, human being Marine with vulnerabilities, emotions and he actually bleeds. He's a real person, like somebody you might know from your town who went to Iraq.While THE MARINE'S John Triton (John Cena) is bulletproof, explosion proof, dives through walls unscratched, hangs onto semi-trucks while it drives through buildings and despite the bombardment of boards, pipes and tin sheets, he rolls off and groans before jumping up and kicking more butt. Not to mention, I don't think a scene goes by that he doesn't remind everybody that he's a Marine and it's the only thing he knows. By the way, the tin sheets would have severed him, easily.Oh, and of course the name Triton is appropriate to refer to John Cena as a Greek God or the largest moon of Neptune.Ridiculous is an understatement. This movie insults our intelligence with a symplistic, unrealistic, poorly written story. Deplorable acting from all involved. Was this movie trying to be a comedy? The jewl thieves are idiots and are more concerned with trying to be comedic than to try to come up with a plan to escape.The real shame is that my script is pretty well useless now. The creators of this movie make dozens of references to my script in the early goings and now my script is old news. Unfortunately, hollywood big wigs have put their MONEY behind THE MARINE, a silly, poorly written, poorly thought out, poorly acted piece of junk.You need more than dozens of unrealistic and over-the-top explosions to grab this reviewer. Unfortunately, I have a brain, and I need more from my action movie than this stupid movie that has absolutely nothing in it that is memorable or meritable.",

    "review/text": "This guy is almost cut like Schwarzenegger but has no sense of humor. Decent action like some of Arnold's early works (e.g. Commando and Red Heat), but not the best acting just like them. If you got a couple hours to blow and want to see a new action movie this will fit the bill. I suggest rental as this does not have alot of replayability in my book. Even my two young stepsons that were Marines weren't impressed. A good popcorn no brainer action movie. If you own any of Schwarzenegger's movies your time would be better spent watching them again. Don't get me wrong I really hope that Cena's career in movies will continue. With time I'm sure his acting will improve as Schwartzenegger's did. Let's face it the movie had potential if the acting was better or they threw in more comedy. About the only funny thing in the movie was when one of the bad guys says, \"He's like the Terminator\", when talking about the Marine, and then Robert Patrick, who played a Terminator in \"Terminator 2\" gives a steely glance at him. If this turns out to be the only movie Cena makes I have to vote for \"Chill Factor\" with Skeet Ulrich or \"Firestorm\" with Howie Long over this one. If they had added in more humor I think it would have worked better.Story Synopsis: A decorated Marine is discharged for disobeying orders for not leaving a man behind against orders. His first day on the job as a security guard he throws a man through the window and is fired. His wife and him take a vacation and she is taken hostage when robbers are identified by police at a gas station. The Marine chases them to get his wife back. Lots of carnage ensues as police, innocent bystanders, and criminals are butchered and slain.",

The action is great for any fan of many explosions, unrealistic fights and over the top car chases(exactly how many times can you shoot a car with automatic weapons and it still drives as if it just came straight off the lot?)...however the acting was poor by practically everyone...nothing convincing at all. I was actually ashamed of screen veteran Robert Patrick's performance....silly punchlines and almost a robotic performance. WWE wrestler John Cena's performance looks as if it was painfully rehearsed one too many times...even the exotic Kelly Carlson's (who had probably every man in the theater wanting her to go to her NipTuck ways of nakedness or sexy lingerie.....sorry fellas no such luck)portayal of Kate Triton(John's fiance) leaves her acting abilities a little less desirable. Even the supporting cast of almost relative unknowns...except for Morgan(Anthony Ray Parker, who many may remember played Dozer in the Matrix) however his bad punchlines, uneven temper and constant \"black man plight\" rants couldnt give CPR to a movie that began drowning from the opening credits. I can't remember the last time I scored something this low but it had to be done for the sake of the action/adventure genre....1 and a half stars.",

    "review/text": "The Marine is a film about a marine that has just been discharged and is back home with his wife. When she's kidnapped by the bad guys, the game is on. It's an action movie and I think most people can spot what this movie is going to be like from that description. So if you're not a person that enjoys action movies like Rambo or Commando then I can safely say that you won't enjoy this film. It's still a paint-by-numbers affair so it's doubtful you'd suddenly find yourself enjoying this type of film.But I am someone who enjoys action movies like Rambo and Commando. So I waited till I found myself in the right mood to watch an action romp, and I stuck this DVD in. The movie starts out with some promise. After John Cena's character is discharged from the military, he takes a job as a security guard. The scene that followed that was fairly entertaining - with Cena throwing around his weight. While that scene is entertaining, it is also meant to show that Cena's character is miserable outside of marine life. This hints at some inner turmoil that is then left behind completely and never again brought up in the film.Robert Patrick does a great job as the bad guy. I thought he was very good. I did not care for his henchmen as they didn't seem to bring anything to the table. Likewise, John Cena is not an actor. He doesn't need to be in an action movie if the plot is compelling but it's really not. There aren't any memorable action scenes that stick out in my mind as I reflect back so all I am recalling is the awkward delivery that John Cena had. I also didn't care for his character's wife; who was very attractive but had a quality about her that said there was nothing going on upstairs. The pair is not a couple who are developed characters; the wife especially comes off as an arrogant shrew and so as a viewer, I'm not invested in the film when she is kidnapped.All in all, this movie would have been a better film as a focus on Robert Patrick's jewelery store heist and escape. That was much more interesting than The Marine and his walk through a swamp. But that's just my opinion.sincerely,R.C.",

    "review/text": "John Cena plays John Triton, a Marine who was discharged after disobeying a direct order in order to save his fellow soldiers in war. He returns home to his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) and after not being able to adjust to his homelife so easliy, they take a vacation. Unfortunally John ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time as he crosses paths with a group of jewel thieves at a gas station led by a killer named Rome (Robert Patrick) and after things don't go as planned, they go on the run & kidnap Kate as a hostage. From there, John goes after the thieves to save his wife but encounter many obsticals along with the way while the theives have problems of their own such as not being to trust each other & Kate being tougher than she looks.This is one of those generic action movies where the plot itself was very simple & something the average person can understand. The acting isn't much as Cena had no previous acting experience before this role so his dialog is very limited but did do well & was believeable in his role. They have good action scenes from a car chase to fist fights to tons of explosions. The most annoying thing here though was that they tried to add comedy to this movie which didn't work at all. For example, when the bad guys are in the jungle running from the police...that's not the time to start making jokes about \"rock candy\" & getting calls about their cable TV package eventhough I did get a chuckle as the priceless look Patrick gave after the \"he's like the Terminator\" line.While the DVD included both the unrated & theatrical versions of the movie, the DVD extras include all the WWE promotional features, footage of the World Premiere, various features on John Cena, and a \"Making Of\" featurette. Bottom line is that this movie is good for those who just like a good old action flick that you used to see back in the 80's full of explosions & fist fight scenes.",

No depth, no brains, just blow up things at random and find things to bicker and whine about... Especially trying to bring racism into the fray... lets blame the senseless violence on the \"black guy\". The character happened to be a black guy and had a penchant for self-destruction... and blowing everything else up as well. I personally found that little whining episode offensive no matter how you chose to interpret it.The character development of John Triton was pretty good, but established him as more of a loose cannon rather than a highly skilled combat individual. This is further reinforced when he gets into fights and essentially uses his face to block many of the punches. That may work in the WWE, but does not establish a character who is supposed to be highly skilled in hand/hand combat.Some of the scenes in the movie seemed to be filler to get minutes. Especially his encounter with the two poachers while running through the swamp.However, the movie still managed to be fun to watch, once I was able to adjust my expectations for the movie to be WWE entertainment, and not as a full action movie.Overall, you can enjoy this movie if you choose to, it isn't a total loss, but neither is it a winner.",

Especially if you take the film makers seriously. The black villain in the story is such a stereo-type of the bad guy obsessed with getting in touch with his blackness. Arch-type - that's what he is. Not a stereotype, but a stand in for all African Americans or rather, the personification of a certain ideology. Perhaps just a reality. This may be done intentionally, that's my opinion. He's not shown to be a reliable character in the film. Just be a person, not a Black man. Perhaps just avoid black men if possible. . . ? Building understanding. . . perhaps - but this film does nothing to improve race relations. Who said the Marines are about better race relations? At least we'd like to imagine they aren't.",

However somehow he is always able to find the bad guys. My biggest complain is that it is a movie about a Marine and he never really uses a gun, he takes them and never uses them. I think the person who wrote it doesn't realize that every Marine is a rifleman and i cannot think of one who wouldn't use a gun to protect his wife. This movie is your standard WWE/WWF film that solves everything with hand to hand combat scenes. I mean come on if i would of wanted to watch a fighting movie then that is what i would've bought. However i bought a movie titled MARINE i fully expect there to be FIREFIGHTS and shooting. That is what really irritates me along with the pathetic acting is that it doesn't make sense. Marines are trained to use guns but this guy doesn't seem to use them even when his wife is in danger.I'm not really sure i can convey to you how bad this movie is.It would be a good film for people who prefer hand to hand combat and like movies with really bad acting and holes in the plot so big you can drive a semi truck threw them.This movie starts out bad and just gets worse and worse.Horrible Movie 1/5 stars.",

The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him.

    "review/text": "Firstly, let me tell you that if you are an elite critic and watched this movie, ask yourself why. Do you even like the action-movie genre? No? Then don't waste our time by writing reviews about stuff you don't enjoy. We like it here and we like Hollywood. So astalavistababy.For all WWE Fans and those who have come to see John Cena blow things up by more than just his fist - this is an awesome action flick. I too came to see this movie because I am a fan of WWF now known as WWE and because I admire John Cena as a person and not just as what we see him do inside the squared ring.The first 5 to 10 minutes of the movie needs to be passed over. To be forgiven. It is not the best start to an action movie. And this is an out and out thriller of an action movie. But then Robert Patrick shows up and everything rocks and everything is cool again. Yes, I came to see Cena and got bowled over by Robert Patrick. Patrick carries this movie. I would say he saved the movie. Cena is great. He is our hero. And we cheer for him throughout the movie as he gets beat while trying to rescue his dear wife. But you can't help fall for Robert Patrick. He waltzes in all bad-a$$ and mean. He is ultra, uber-cool. He makes the badguy role come alive and give meaning to the whole story. As in any story, for the hero to be a hero, you need a strong adversary. We get that in the form of a team of criminals led by Robert Patrick.The action is non-stop. As soon as the villain has done his first job in the movie - the action keeps up the tempo and we get big gunfights and bigger explosions. The crazy black dude routine is well played here by a henchman of Patrick. I was a bit disappointed with the truth behind the \"rock candy story\" - they should have made it as big as it sounded. But there is plenty of more fun in the movie. Some dark humour and Cena is incredible as he chases down the bad guys in the mandatory car chase sequence and then on in the swamps. This is thrilling from there till the very end. Some good hand-to-hand fights. Cena gets punished and he triumphs. The deviation with the 2 other crooks in the same swamp thinking Cena is a cop looking for them is also brilliant turn of events. More action. More a$$-kicking. The scenes with the explosion are very well shot.The two big ones with Cena at the petrol pump explosion and him at the shack in the swamp exploding are incredibly well captured. You could feel Cena getting the fury of the fire. Awesome stuff. And Patrick is unstoppable too. He is determined and he has the wife as a leverage and hostage. There is the essential bad girl accompanying the villain, Patrick. She does a great job, better I think than the actress who plays Cena's wife. In all I would rate high the casting as the team of Patrick is well picked bunch of actors doing what they do best. These bad guys are worth cheering for.Cena of course makes it to the climax. An epic one it is, involving a truck, a motorboat, explosions, fistfights, splattering of blood and the suspense of whether Cena's wife will survive this ordeal or not.Watch this one and make sure you reload the popcorn.",

    "review/text": "Now The Marine doesn't try to be a good movie, it lets you know right from the beginning what it is going to be. A huge muscleman marine is told to wait for the rest of the soldiers on a mission. He says \"not enough time\" and charges in to blow things up. Next scene he is being discharged and has to go find a job as a security guard. This is all in the first 2 minutes of the movie. The thing that really bothered me about the movie was that everything that went on really had no point and did not make a difference later in the film. That isn't the only thing they weren't able to complete, not by a long shot. The bad guys have this big black guy on their side and he is not unfunny, they just don't give him anything funny to say. I seriously think that he didn't complete a single joke. In fact, the liquid metal guy from Terminator 2 stars as the main bad guy and they even throw in a reference to that and it was the only joke they actually completed. I thought that it was the least bad part of the movie.Now the reason I went to see this was becasue I was told it had great fights. The shootouts were nice to look at and the explosions became so repetitious I almost fell asleep, but the fights were once again just the same old I hit you and then you hit me style. The best fight of the movie included 2 characters who were never explained and this scene could have been from entirely different film for all I know. So if you are looking for the worst big budget movie of the year, then check this out.",

Smart business move.This is in fact a terrific action/adventure movie in the mold of the Rambo or Schwarzenegger films (e.g. \"Commando\") or the Indiana Jones series. The violence is not accurate in depiction of results, but neither is it in any movie where female stars takes full-power strikes and come bouncing back. If reality counted in the movies, there would be no girl-star action movies.The violence is actually toned down in favor of action. For example, Sgt. Triton chooses to takes out two very tough villains in exciting brawls when he has a good fighting knife with him. Reality would have been different .... and much bloodier. Not much gore or blood in this picture, however, and you can safely take your pre-teen or teen son. Or yourself. My wife liked it, too, for that matter.Don't be surprised to see the knife on the market soon, ala Rambo.The acting was top-drawer within the context of the plot. I never heard of John Cena,so I can't be considered biased. Triton was seen first in front of his commanding officer, then interacting with his wife. He was supposed to be emotionally restrained with his commander, and strong but a little reflective with his wife. He was. Then The Marine had a mission. He had to complete it, not emote and burst into tears. After the adrenalin high wore off, he'd probably start shaking, but while things were going on, he didn't have time to be upset. Man, haven't the sweetie-boys who have panned his acting ever been in a fight? I never heard of the star,but he turned in a very believable good performance for the part. The excellent-looking wife did a fine job as well. No nudity in this movie. Unfortunately.In sum, a fine example of its type and highly recommended for all. It requires some suspension of belief, but most action movies do.Recommended for fans of John Cena, the WWE, and Arnold and Rambo for that matter.GunnerGunner December, 2007",

And, last but not least, there's going to be a good guy who is good and tough beyond belief.John Triton (John Cena) is an heroic ex-marine whose wife, Kate (Kelly Carlson) is kidnapped by a brutal gang of jewel thieves led by Rome (Robert Patrick), who kills with glee and without remorse, which doesn't set him apart from his psychopathic gang members. John takes out after them. You get the feeling that John can take on anything up to the size of a platoon without much of a problem. While credibility might suffer during his chase, it's still fun. You will rarely see a human being with arms the size of Cena's.Written (Michelle Gallagher and Alan McElroy) and directed (John Bonito) with humor and pace, what surprised me about it was that the acting is uniformly good, including Cena. This is a tongue-in-cheek chase film with some absurdly unbelievable stunts and special effects, but it's all done on a level that nobody takes very seriously.Although there is a lot of violence, it's not graphic in the sense that we see people's heads being blown off. I was tired and sleepy when I attended the film, but never even felt a twinge of nodding off.Perfect for a saturday night with friends after a long week of work.",

The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great, sarcastic bad guy, plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking, thankfully.

He has failed miserably with the WBF, XFL and programs on MTV & he couldn't sell a quality meal in New York City. So Vince now tries that magic business touch in the film industry. Huh?It appears that Vince has just a little jealousy towards \"The Rock,\" Dwayne Johnson, and his great success making movies to the point where he doesn't need to do any bumps for the WWE and the McMahon family. Granted, Vince receives a nice sum of cash for Johnson's wrestling moniker to be used for movies, but that just isn't enough.And where Johnson has long-since passed up the 1980s-styled superhero genre, here comes Vince lumbering along in his powerwalk with his answer to The Rock, John Cena. Yes, that John Cena who was going to be a hip-hop star; until he proved that he has no hip and zero hop in his mic skills.But have a script comparable with Sylvester Stallone's ridiculous Rambo character - with Cena's mannerisms that could be termed as the nephew to the fictional tough-guy - blow all kinds of things up and Vince is in business. Hardly.The first weekend in theaters, October 13-15, 2006, The Marine did a tepid $7 million in box office sales and then sank faster than a pay-per-view main event featuring Fit Finlay.Cena plays his WWE role well, but he isn't a real actor. Vince is a wrestling promoter who has failed each time he has stepped outside the family business. The Marine was produced 20-plus years too late to have anyone but the biggest WWE Cena fans taking time to see it in theaters.And Vince better keep that cozy economic reality in mind for the next flick.",

The WWF gave us Stone Cold Steve Austin in THE CONDEMNED which was fun and Austin was great. But like THE MARINE, we see almost zero of the world famous torsoes of these super heroes. In THE CONDEMEND, Austin never takes off his shirt for one scene. And he has a body to die for. in THE MARINE, you've got about l5 seconds where we see Cena without his shirt and his body is amazing. But after that, he's fully covered. The reason I worship these wrestling super stars is because they're so damned good looking and they don't mind strutting their stuff in a pair of speedoes. One can only hope that the next WWF action thriller will give us a super star wrestler who exhibits his chest --like Schwartzenneger, Stallone, Von Damm--and give us fans something to thrill to.",

    "review/text": "'The Marine' has an instant appeal. While not innovative, it sports some eye-popping pyrotechnics and chase scenes that don't give the audience a chance to catch its breath. John Cena fans will likely be enthralled, especially since his character acquires some boxing and martial arts abilities to add to his wrestling repertoire. (Nine lives don't hurt, either.) Even the threads and riveting music draw our attention; both a modest update to 'Miami Vice,' (the TV series). Seeming random at first, John Tritan (Cena) gets established as a sort of Iraq War Rambo whose prowess will undoubtedly help him save his domestic life. Coming home, he finds his new job as a security guard dull, even if it gets him on the eleven o'clock news and another chance to come home to Kay (Kelly Carlson), his pretty young wife. The plot is simple: Jewel thieves, who score hideously for keeping a low-profile, have a show-down at a remote gas station where the military couple are also filling up for a trek to leave it all behind. Cornered, they hijack their SUV with Kay left in tow.The draw of the film may be more conservative, for its gung ho military preface and a plot where the hero saves his wife. There are drawbacks for everyone, though. The acting overall is below a television par, and the dialogue is mostly flat. Taking references meant to be funny from 'Deliverance,' 'Terminator,' and 'Freddy Krieger,' the screenwriters borrow heavily because they seldom have anything new to offer. The female feistiness also seems token, like the characters were meant not to offend the audience with any vulnerable traits. (Undoubtedly, they are also drawing more ringside entertainment as well.) An understandable draw for some, 'The Marine' will undoubtedly please no matter how predictable it may seem. 'Die Hard 2' with Bruce Willis did the same story a couple decades ago and did it better.",

    "review/text": "this movie is an awful movie. the acting is horrible and the actors try to hard to try and be funny which just makes the movie painful. the main character, played by john cena, seems to have animal like reflexes and instincts, seeming to be able to track the bad guys down by stupid things like sniffing the air and following non-existent clues. Im not going to go into every stupid part of this movie, but ill just say its EXTREMELY unrealistic. its so bad, i think a 5 year old can point out the ridiculous things john cena \"can\" do. for example, hes able to practically fly and jump onto a moving truck from standing on the ground. he is also able to survive being inside a building that blows up and looks as though the atom bomb was dropped on it, yet somehow he still is alive. also, i might be crazy, but im pretty sure if you were holding onto a truck and being rammed through a building at fast speeds, you wouldnt live. also, not many people i know can run through walls and not be hurt. speaking of not being hurt, there is an instance in the movie while inside a burning building, john cena is hit by falling, burning wood and is unaffected. this movie is awful and i would recommend if your looking for an action movie, to look somewhere else. i cant believe people actually buy this movie and can watch it without wanting to cry.",

    "review/text": "At least once a year, along comes a film that's so wrapped up in hype and promises of greatness that you know it can't be as good as its makers would want you to believe. The distinctive model of this for 2006 was \"The Marine\", the second feature of the newly-founded WWE Films, starring ex world champion John Cena. To state plainly, this is one godawful movie: a lame and poorly-written publicity project by Vince McMahon's sports entertainment empire that can't even be redeemed by placing it under the action/adventure genre. As a fan of both the WWE and action films, I was blown away by how uninteresting and unexciting the filmmakers could make this $23 million picture, considering that it was co-written by the same fellow who penned \"Rapid Fire\", \"Spawn\", and \"Wrong Turn\", and directed by a producer of WWE - a company that is built upon fast-paced action and excitement.Let's start with the focus of this debacle - the star, John Cena. Though I feel apathetic about him as a wrestler, John Cena is most definitely not up to being an action hero: lacking the talent of Sylvester Stallone and Harrison Ford, the personality of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the moves of Jean-Claude Van Dam, the humour of Jackie Chan, and even the sincerity of character of Steven Seagal or Dolph Lundgren, Cena looks woefully out of place and confused amidst the explosions, gunfights, and combat fatigues, and doesn't even have any decent one-liners to his credit to make up for his lack of presence. Essentially, he's as bland of an action star as they get.Mind you, this wouldn't really be that much of a problem if the film featured a strong enough supporting cast to make up for the star's deficiencies, but even here \"The Marine\" falls flat: Robert Patrick (\"Terminator 2\") as the film's wannabe-crazy villain and Kelly Carlson (\"Player 5150\") as Cena's spunky kidnapped wife are not really feeling the script at any point, and neither are the half-dozen or so supporting villains - including Anthony Ray Parker (\"The Matrix\") as a token black guy who alludes to being molested at summer camp for the sake of humour - most of whom kill each other before Cena can even prove himself by beating them up.Even if we were to completely ignore the shoddy acting, there is little in either the storyline (Cena is a discharged marine whose wife is kidnapped by jewel thieves) or the action sequences to hold our attention. While the film nicely portrays the depression and \"lost\" feeling of a soldier who has just returned home from combat, and the \"man-saving-wife\" premise holds some lingering potential, the vast majority of the plot descends quickly into mundaneness, and focuses mainly on the group of villains stabbing eachother in the back and the pursuing Cena having to fight off hillbillies. The action offers absolutely nothing new or innovative: though the chase scene with Cena in the police cruiser is cool, it's a dim highlight amidst mediocrity that features standard gunfights, no martial arts, and more explosions that one expects can occur in the swamps of South Carolina.In short, \"The Marine\" does not raise the bar at all above fellow panned WWE Films \"See No Evil\" and \"The Condemned\". If they want to be taken seriously in the realm of cinema, the writers of WWE will have to stop relying on clich&eacute;-driven pictures and name-recognition to be successful. After all, Cena's flick failed to make back its budget, as did Steve Austin's \"The Condemned\". Think outside of the box, huh?",

    "review/text": "The Marine is quite a phenomenal action film! The amounts of insanely addicting and devastating-looking action scenes are overwhelming. The film stars WWE wrestler John Cena in search of his wife who was kidnapped by a bunch of guys who weren't afraid to die, or kill anyone who unfortunately happened to get in their way.Anyone who enjoys action films with lots of hand fighting and lots of shooting (and I mean LOTS of these things) you will definitely find yourself enjoying the Marine. It's nothing but total nonstop action for the last hour or so. The movie clocks in at 1 hour and 23 minutes (even though some other places have said the time length was a bit longer, it's actually not). The negative reviews are really strange to me- John Cena himself promoted the movie as nothing but an action film. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's just lots and lots of ACTION!My favorite moments were the exploding gas station and the bad guys shooting Cena's car WHILE it was flipping around in the air! These are truly some of the greatest action scenes a movie could ask for. Anything better than this would be impossible!",

    "review/text": "Thank god I borrowed this movie from my roommate. I doubt I would have ever even rented it if I was back in the states (I'm in Iraq right now). This is going to be a short review for a pretty bad movie.Before you read my review, please take not that I'm an action movie fan. Whether it's a good one with a pretty decent plot or a fun one where you can drink and laugh to it with its whack out plot and crazy actions scenes. This movie just fell short of anything fun or good.The beginning intro with Cena rescuing some marine buddies was action packed but choreographed horribly. It looked incredibly fake. My hopes for a decent movie faded quickly.One of the cooler parts of the movie was a bank heist that was led by Rome (Robert Patrick better known as T1000 from T2). If it wasn't for the horrible direction and script, Patrick would've pulled this character off in a very cool way. This scene gave me hope for an ok movie to maybe get a little drunk to and laugh at the over the top action scenes.Then comes the kidnapping. It felt like 40 minutes of the movie we watched Cena run and jump through the woods trying to rescue his girl from the bad guys. Pretty annoying.Then we see the bad guys take refuge in an abandoned bar in the middle of a swamp that the police were JUST in. Honestly I believe there would've been cops that would've stayed there JUST in case this exact scenario would have happened...but whatever... I dont expect common sense to happen in action movies... especially bad ones like this. So we have Cena taking out bad guy after bad guy here till the oh so predictable twist of the movie happens.If you like explosions, trust me about this, you'll see massive ones every 25 minutes of the movie it seems like.Also Kate (Kelly Carlson from Nip/Tuck) played a pretty good part for such a bad role. What really makes me irritated about her part though was that she gave the bad guys SUCH hell that there is no way they wouldn't have just killed her to get rid of the crap she was putting them through. Like I said earlier, I dont mind cheese in bad action movies, but this was just driving me nuts.I gave it 2 stars mainly for Robert Patrick. Like I said earlier, he played his part as well as he could for the craptastic script. I would love to see him with a similar role in a movie that's in better hands.",

I'm a fan of the WWE, but I know that the wresters can't act to save thier lives. But I went to see this movie, because I was hoping that it would make me change my mind. But it didn't, there was only one good scene in the movie and that was the very first 5 minutes. John Cena's character in Iraq showed how brave our troops truly are, even though he went in guns ablazing. I love action movies, I love the testaterone pumping flicks like Terminator 2, Predator, and Casino Royale. But this movie didn't get me excited, in fact, it made me laugh. By the end of the movie my sides hurt from laughing so hard. John Cena is about as good of an actor as he is in the ring. His character survives around 6 or 7 massive explosions without a scratch. I don't mind when an action flick has scenes that can't happen in real life, but this was overkill. The only reason I gave this move 2 out of 5 stars instead of 1, was because of it's portrayal of how brave our troops are over in Iraq. When I went to go see it with my friend, he and I were probably the only people without Cena shirts on, so if you're a fan of Cena, then you'll love this movie. I for one can't beleive how crappy of a movie it was. Don't waste your money on this, go buy a copy of Terminator 2, you'll thank me.",

    "review/text": "For the first half hour of this movie the viewer may get the idea that the script Michelle Gallagher and Alan B. McElroy is just awful (with good perception!), but as the film's story evolves the idea that this may just be a National Lampoon parody of action flicks - and if that is the case, it is truly a funny bit of entertainment - for a while. Then it becomes obvious that the minimal storyline (ex-Marine's wife is abducted by diamond thieves and Marine elects to leave his one day 'security job' and take the initiative to capture his wife and strike down the bad guys in the swamps of North Carolina) is really just a matrix for staging as many pyrotechniques explosions as possible. It does get tedious.The 'star' of this noisy, 'Unrated-for-destructive-violence' film is one John Cena, another wrestler from WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) being promoted by the director John Bonito to follow the path of The Rock: the difference is The Rock has done some classy acting and a range of roles that call for much more than flexing whereas Cena seems completely like a fish out of water who has yet to take a class in acting basics. John Cena does have a splendid physique and perhaps that should have been more on camera. Instead his 'John Triton' character, despite his tremendous physical advantages, gets beaten up by some pretty small and older guys, making us wonder why he has all that bulk and no fighting ability.The cast is good to adequate and once you realize this film is a parody, they seem even better delivering the corny lines they are given. Among the crew are Robert Patrick as Rome (the chief bad guy), Kelly Carlson as John's wife, Anthony Ray Parker as the hilarious 'token black' bad guy (he truly has comedic talent), hunkies Manu Bennett and Frank Carlopio for eye candy, Abigail Bianca, Jerome Ehlers, Damon Gibson, and Drew Powell as the crew in flight. They are a likeable bunch of criminals but oh can they blow things up! For the action film addicts only. Grady Harp, February 07",

    "review/text": "Patrick was the only real enjoyable part of this whole movie, and he kept it entertaining, which is the only reason I could think of anyone (who's not a kid or a Cena fan)wanting to see this movie. The movie pretty much portrays Cena in the action film genre as the WWE portrays him as a WWE superstar, invincible, unbeatable, and never get's injured. The way bullets and explosions always seem to miss him make it seem like John Woo films (such as Hard Boiled)are realistic enough to be documentaries. The 2 scenes I can easily point out as examples include when Cena is driving a car at the car the villians are driving, and 2 or 3 villians are unloading magazine after magazine rounds at the 'front' of the car, shattering the window, destroying the hood, and yet not one even scratches Cena who doesn't even try to dodge most of them (there's one part where he tries to put up a bullet proof vest, but that only lasts for a couple seconds, and you mine as well forget it ever happened when compared to the rest of the scene). Then the part at the end fight (with Patrick) where Cena takes a sledgehammer to the gut at a full force impact, then continues the fight 15 seconds later like nothing happened.The movie is good as a one time popcorn flick with a few buddies, but even then it would still not be enjoyable since, like in 9 out of 10 Cena matches in the WWE, Cena wins, and the opponent(s) people are really cheering for and who are overall better than Cena (in this case, Patrick has better charisma and acting skills) lose.See it if you want, but I would put it on the 'pass' list.

The story is violent -- explosions are the threat the movie begins with -- and there are maybe two mild profanities in the general release version.

Cena has to be one of the worst actors to ever get a starring role in a movie released in theaters. Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back. WWE could have easily found someone better. Skip this movie. In fact do someone a favor, buy the dvd and destroy it so no one would have to witness this horrible movie. I would give it a 0 if I could. Nothing about this movie is good",

Especially we enjoyed seeing the premiere of the movie at USMC Camp Pendleton. I wish we had had a John Cena movie when I was in the Corps. If you want beginning-to-end romping, stomping, hell, death and destruction....this flick is for YOU! The Terminator has nothing on the character of former Marine Triton.

    "review/text": "You know those movies from back in the day that you thought were great, but you watch them now and think they are the worst movies ever made? This movie could certainly fit the later, but whether you think it is any good in the first place remains to be seen. The quality of this movie, or lack thereof as the case may be, is evidenced in the filming sequence (you've seen it a 100 times before in every B movie that has come before it) and the dialog (painful) of the opening scene. There is no plot nor dialog to be had in this movie.This movie is about WWE style action and John Cena. Some good points, the death of Angela was a fun scene, as well as John's police car going over the cliff. That sequence was excellent, but of course the 5 minutes that preceded that of the police car getting shot up, was way over the top and beyond belief. I hope they were just making fun of bad action films, but I think they were actually just being one. There are a couple of other so unbelievable scenes that I was actually left feeling the director could care less about the intelligence level of his adult audience.So, I really can not recommend this movie, and thought it bad enough to write a review. If you are a fan of WWE and John Cena and want to see action no more believable as what you might see on Smackdown, you may very well like this movie. There is nothing wrong with that if that is your bag, and the 16 year old WWE fan I took seemed to like it. But if you expect to get more for your money, then I recommend passing on this one.I did want to add a few comments. First, I seem to have hit a nerve with some fans. Sorry. That is my honest review. Don't smack-me-down because I really hated this movie that you may have liked. As I said, it may very well be likable by some people, as it was by the 16 year old I took to see it. Heck, I actually enjoyed Paris Hilton's one hit wonder, but I'm honest enough to know that many people think even less of her then I did of this movie. All the more power to them, as long at they are honest in their review. So give me a break on that please. I did also want to add one thing I liked about this movie, which is at least it was cheaper to take my fiance and her son to see it, then it was to pay for one pay per view smackdown.",

    "review/text": "Some might say, that professional wrestlers are already actors to some extent. WWE Studios is dedicated to expanding the careers of those with acting talent, from the ring to the big screen. As a champion, John Cena brought an imposing physical presence, rugged good looks, and a certain flair for the dramatic, to his wrestling, and music endeavors. The Marine (2006), is a vehicle designed to showcase Cena's talents, and he acquits himself well enough, in his big screen debut, an explosive and exciting, but still rather unremarkable action thriller.Cena is ex-Marine John Triton, discharged from the service for disobeying orders while on a mission in Iraq. Returning stateside, Triton finds civilian life a little rough, and decides to get away from it all for a while, heading into the South Carolina mountains, with his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson, Nip/Tuck).At a roadside gas station, a gang of thieves on the run, ambush a couple of highway patrolmen. With their vehicle damaged, the criminals, led by Rome (Robert Patrick), and his lieutenant Angela (Abigail Bianca), slug John, kidnap Kate, and hit the road in Triton's SUV. Triton gives chase in the patrol car, in what is the action highlight of the first half of the film. The gang is left travelling on foot through the swamp, with Triton on their trail. The group make their way to a safe house. Triton arrives and takes out some of the gang, but Rome sets off and explosion, and makes his escape. Triton again has to dodge a fireball, and after borrowing a police speedboat, finally catches up to Rome. Up until the finish, Cena's fight scenes are fairly routine, but the battle between Cena and Patrick finally generates a few sparks.Although the story is rather simplistic and uncomplicated, The Marine does entertain, and provides the requisite opportunities for John Cena to flex his muscles, and exercise his fledgling acting skills. Robert Patrick (The Unit, Terminator 2) is a known talent, and brings some humor and class to the production, and he has enough physical stature to take on Cena. Kelly Carlson (who should be in more films) and Australian Abigail Bianca, mix it up, in a couple of spirited fights.Working with director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2), the acting potential that is shown here, is more fully realized in Cena's next film, 12 Rounds (2009). Though he is still chasing after a girl, Cena's character is more well rounded, and the film features more of Cena doing his thing, behind the wheel of a vehicle.",

The plot deals with a marine who discovers his wife has been kidnapped by an evil, demented villin, and it's up to this marine to track down his wife's captor and make him pay. TV's \"Nip/Tuck's\" Kelly Carlson plays the wife and Robert Patrick is an OK villin, but it's Cena'a perfomance and presence that make the film. I am sure with the write script Cena could be a huge movie star; he has amazing screen presence, with the looks and body that most actors would die for.The DVD comes with many bonuses including both the theatrical and unrated versions, the featurette called \"The Making of The Marine\", WWE Promotional Features, John Cena Featurettes, and more.",

When a film like this one has some truly outstanding fiery explosions to maintain a viewer's interest, that attention span will last only for as long as do the FX, and even with that there are diminishing returns. John Cena, the WWE wrestler, is John Triton, an ex-Marine discharged from the Corps only because he disobeyed orders to save the lives of three fellow marines. You would think his commanding officer would have understood. He takes a job as a security officer and gets fired immediately, again for just doing his job. The primary problem with THE MARINE is the expectation that one has in terms of why one sees this film. I choose to see action movies that have a hard to achieve balance between the exploits of the action star and the believability of the plot. Stallone had no problem doing that in any of his RAMBO films. Cena has a long way to go to find this happy medium.Robert Patrick is the Bad Guy. He mugs, makes unwelcome advances to Cena's wife, and generally conducts a criminal campaign on the fly. You know that an action film is off kilter when the Bad Guy by default becomes the focus of interest. Cena does little more than take beatings, give beatings, narrowly escape death in fiery car crashes, and scowl on cue. If Cena has a future in acting, that future is probably in the ring as a wrestler.",

    "review/text": "At the outset, it is prudent to state the obvious: action movies are prone to having sequences that are not believable. No matter how good (or bad) the action flick, this remains true. However, some action movies push the envelope so far beyond the realm of believability that the movies become more like cartoons rather than films to be taken seriously.Such is the case with this present movie. There are huge explosions in which people walk away unscathed. A police car gets shot to pieces by about a thousand bullets, then flies off a cliff, yet our hero waltzes away as insouciantly as though he's returning from Walmart with a bag of groceries.The casting of the story is decent. Robert Patrick is nice & sinister and as such plays a good bad guy, and there is a cute reference toTerminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD). John Cena is certainly buffed up enough to be a credible action hero, but the problem is he has no acting prowess whatsoever. He makes fellow wrestler-turned-actor The Rock look like Charleton Heston.By far & away the best performance belongs to Kelly Carlson. It is clear that she has bona-fide acting talents, most of which are wasted in this farce of an action movie. I do hope to see more of her in the future - much more!Beyond the believability aspect of the film, the pacing is pretty lousy. The opening scene shows the hero doing heroic things on a mission against terrorists in Iraq. I think the movie would have been much better had they stretched out this scene another 20 minutes, as it was actually interesting. Instead, they stretch out the last 1/2 of the film, and things move along at a snail's pace.Also, it appears that the filmmakers were a bit torn on which direction they wanted the movie to go, ratings wise. It had a few golden opportunities for un-contrived gratuitous nudity. Unfortunately, they held back, ostensibly just for the PG-13 rating. Had they made an \"R\" version of the movie, it would have been a lot better. I would have loved to see Ms. Carlson topless!All-in-all, this movie is for action movie junkies only. And, even they will wince at just how un-believable some of the sequences are. For myself, I hope that John Cena goes to acting school before making another film. Hey, it DID work wonders for Arnie!",

    "review/text": "The Marine is about a marine (John Cena) who is kicked out due to not following orders well. He then gets fired from his security job after man handling a jerk. He then stresses to his friend that \"being a marine is what he did best\". Then on a trip with his wife she's taken hostage by jewel thieves. They carry big guns and blow stuff up but while acting like the kind of baffoons you'd see in a Home Alone movie. Robert Patrick is cool as the leader of the bad guys but he gets so many goofy lines that it's hard to take him seriously. I think he's a wasted actor. I mean his performance in Walk the Line and other serious roles show that. Plus no he did not kill the X-Files like many fans say. The show trying to continue without Mulder killed the X-Files. He was pretty good in it.Anyway this movie doesn't know if it's an action thriller or action comedy. Plus I don't know why people praise the stunts. It's like wannabe Transporter or Transporter 2 type action. Plus with so many huge explosions you'd think that at least one person would die in them. But John Cena escapes every huge explosion without a mark on him.We also have seen how many movies where the heroe takes one bad guy at a time as one after another goes looking for him one after another. It worked a lot better for Die Hrad than it does for this film though. Now the good about the movie. It offers sexy women and although I'm not the biggest John Cena fan I can't say he's a bad action star. He has the right look even if he does basically give a one note performance. He's a marine and he makes sure we think of him as nothing but a marine. The script also makes sure we just think of him as nothing but a dangerous marine that loves his wife too. Since that's all we ever learn about him. It's just a fast paced brainless action film so it doesn't need any character build-up.",

    "review/text": "This movie is almost a joke. The beginning starts off quite nicely with our \"Marine\" taking down 9 terrorist with a machine gun and hand-to-hand combat, without even being touched. The problem is later in the movie our same \"Marine\" is knocked down with a fire extinguisher, a branch, and a bar. Apparently terrorists trained in the military with machine guns are much less capable than a man with a fire extinguisher.Second, the \"Marine\" was knocked unconscious by both the fire extinguisher and tree branch yet being punched hard multiple times tied to a chair, he is left un-phased.Third, our \"Marine\" seems to get punched a lot for being such a skilled fighter. Even going up against hill billies he gets thrown through a table. Which also shows hill billies are skilled in hand to hand combat, a reality this movie taught me.Fourth, no one seems to care that our well respected \"Marine\" leaves a wounded cop unattended and steals a cop car. Throughout the movie he causes hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage without being reprimanded.Fifth, a good portion of the movie consist of our \"Marine\" following people through the woods. That's it.... Wow.... Exciting.....Sixth, our marine jumps out of a flaming car over the edge of a cliff. 10 minutes later he is walking on land. Apparently it is left to our imagination how marines can fly.Seventh, When our \"Marine\" gives CPR its just pathetic. It looks funny to begin with because John Cena's arms are as big as his wifes body, but its even worse because he doesn't do CPR right to begin with.I'll be fair, there were good fight scenes. There was a girl-girl fight scene (which lasted about 1 minute) though it was much more entertaining than the WWE girl-girl \"matches\". This movie was not action packed, it had action, but was not action packed.",

Cena puts on a stellar performance playing...well, himself just kicking the [...] out of people. This movie had me on the edge of my seat locked into intensity from beginning to end and even then I could have sitten through at least 43 minutes more. In fact I think those 43 minutes could have been used wisely because they didn't show enough of Cena kicking the [...] out of dinosaurs. Who knows maybe there will be some animal butt kicking too intense to show in theaters awaiting my approval on the DVD. But on a more serious note folks, this movie has great acting, in depth storytelling, fourth dimensional characters, Oscar worthy writing, jaw dropping wit, and enough explosions to blow your neighbors ear drums three miles away. The night before this release you will find me camped outside of my nearest retail store begging for the first eight copies of this cinematic masterpiece that only WWE films could put forth. BUY THIS MOVIE! You will not be disappointed!!!!P.S. Some of you may think that this review is a big pile of sarcasm. I'm here to tell you otherwise. WATCH OUT HATHAWAY!!\"",

    "review/text": "THE MARINEI have to admit that I have enjoyed all of the 7 or 8 or something like that WWE produced films, this one in particular. Sure some have been better then others but all have at least been entertaining, this one here would be in that category. I always liked John Cena especially when he was a heel, he has always been entertaining. So once WWE really wanted to get going with the movies I knew Cena would be starring in one. I am glad that the film did well enough at the box office for them to let him do another. I found this movie to be very enjoyable even though it is flawed.The movie is about John Triton an ex marine who is having a hard time adjusting to his new life as a civilian. After a mishap at a security guard job he took he and his wife decided to go on a trip to any were just to get away on vacation. It is on this trip that they run into some trouble at a gas station, it turns out that some people who are also there just robbed a diamond place and is on the run. When things go wrong Triton's wife is kidnapped by these guys and the chase is on. So the rest of the movie we are treated to an action filled adventure that pits one man's love for his wife against those who have a lust for money and power.The strong point of this film is obviously the ridiculous unbelievable action sequences, and I do mean unbelievable. Michell Gallagher and Alan McElroy did a decent job with the script basically just adding a few words to pages full of explosions and fist fights. For this, a WWE film that is just fine and I did not expect any thing else so it makes perfect sense. Director John Bonito shows that he has a talent for making a fun yet over the top action flick and he even makes Cena look good in his first acting gig, so credit to you sir. Director of photography David Eggby did a great job shooting this movie as the camera work is great, Executive producer Vince McMahon knows how to hire the right people. Every one behind the scenes did what a consider a good job given that this was supposed to be a WWE action movie, job well done.As far as the acting I think that while Cena has a way to go before he wins any Oscars he actually does a good job with this film, he has a natural charisma that carries over onto the screen. At times it looks like the performance is forced but over all he does a pretty good job in my opinion, I don't know why but I think he would be perfect in a comedy or a family comedy. Kelly Carlson is good as Cena's wife and brings a nice little charm to the film even though at times she gets rough with the other characters. Robert Patrick is great in the lead villain role with a sly humor to him, and his partner Abigail Bianca is just as good. In fact to be honest no one does a bad job in this film and in fact all of them do very well for this type of film.I liked this movie I thought it was a fun over the top action flick in the vain of 80's movies [like other reviews have said]; it is a good weekend/afternoon movie. A lot of people talk bad about this movie and John Cena in particular, but I liked it and Cena. I think if Cena is given time to develop as an actor I think he could actually be good. Hopefully he has developed more for the upcoming \"12 Rounds\"; I will go see it keep up the WWE streak. Hope to see ya there.",

    "review/text": "Pro wrestler John Cena flexes his acting muscles and discovers that, alas, when it comes to cinema, he's a 98 pound sissy. Having said that, THE MARINE is not the most abysmal of B-movies. It doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is: a modest actioner sponging off the quasi-hot commodity that is John Cena. I quite enjoyed the deliberate tongue-in-cheek, off-the-wall tone in some parts of the flick, which was a respite from all the uninspired swamp chasing and the mind-numbing, been there, done that heroics and explosions. Truth to tell, this picture is worth watching most for Robert Patrick's wiggy bad guy performance. Now this cat was having fun.The plot: Ex-sergeant John Triton (John Cena) may have been dishonorably discharged, but he still considers himself a marine at heart. Back in the civilian world, he becomes a rent-a-cop and, on his first day on the job, gets promptly sacked. As a consolation prize, he's talked into getting away from it all and ventures on a road trip with his beautiful wife Kate (Kelly Carlson). But this ends up being one of the most heinous of holidays ever as the Tritons bump into a gang of diamond thieves at a gas station, which then becomes the site of a shoot-out and results in Kate being kidnapped. What happens next is Triton channeling his inner marine, stolidly trekking thru the messy portions of South Carolina, and semper-fying the crap out of the hooligans and knuckleheads what done him wrong.Thespian newbie John Cena is earnest, I'll give him that, and must've graduated with honors from the School of Posing Heroically and Surviving Big Kabooms. No, Cena doesn't really distinguish himself from all the other would-be heir to Schwarzenegger's kingdom (the Rock, Vin Diesel, Jason Statham). In fact, he's not even as good as the action stars in the parentheses. If this was still the '90s, he'd be *ouch* Brian Bosworth. Now, maybe that last one's a bit too harsh. Cena is adequate, if torpid, in his first picture outing and even threatens to show niggling bits of potential. But, when one thug comments, \"This guy's like the Terminator.\", well, no, he's not. Think what you will about Ah-nuld's acting, part of his box office clout was due to his self-deprecating sense of humor. In future films (should there be any), Cena needs to loosen up a bit. Or a lot. Even Jason Bourne thinks this guy's too impassive. On the positive side, John Cena is ripped like crazy. Even his Adam's apple is cut.So just how much fun was Robert Patrick having in this flick? He steals all the scenes, along with the diamonds, and delivers his lines with such obvious relish. His quirky and amusing take on his role is what kept me watching up until the end, where, as one reviewer pointed out, Cena administered a very dubious brand of CPR. Kelly Carlson also makes a good showing as the not-quite-hapless hostage and all around hottie, although she could've grieved just a bit more for her hubbie when he's first assumed dead over a cliff. I'm always up for a girl on girl brawl, and Kelly has several with equally tasty bad girl (naughty girl?) Abigail Bianca. By the way, it says something about the charisma-challenged Cena that even the henchmen end up being more interesting. One gets the feeling that, when not pulling bank heists, this motley crew of crooks puts in some massive down time in deep therapy. For real, they've got issues.Action sequences and stunts? So-so. With both having a wrestling background, it's only natural, I guess, that Cena and the Rock are studied under the same light. But it's not even close as Cena hands down pales in that comparison. The Rock just seems to be more kinetic and just more...aware. He knows how to play to his movie audience. Cena is still learning the Hollywood ropes. And it doesn't serve him at all that his fight scenes are boringly choreographed and that the car chase and explosions are run-of-the-mill. Was there even a real sense of jeopardy at any point in the film?Two and a half stars for THE MARINE, with a special shout out going to Robert Patrick for his just-a-wee-bit-mental performance.",

John Cena might be able to act, but he got completely shot down in this one from the horrible directing and script, as well as the terribly bad acting from the supporting cast except maybe from the sarcastic guy from Terminator 2.I had an unbelievably hard time trying to get passed the self-stereotyping done by the bad guys. it was like they were trying to get the audience to hate the fact that they were even casted into the movie. This is one movie i wouldn't recommend to anyone except the extreme fans of the WWE, or maybe the little kids who believe the storylines in wrestling are actually real drama.one fine point that i thought was extremely humorous about the movie. How is it that you can drive a camero (or whatever the cop car was) at top speeds with a million and one bullet holes in it and not either a) blow up, b) blow a tire, c) just die or d) not allow the driver to get hit from any of the million and one bullets?i certainly hope this movie was supposed to be strictly a comedy because if it wasn't, the director should be shot and left in the car that mysteriously didn't blow up.",

    "review/text": "This film promised lots of action. It delivered. The numerous explosions made a great spectacle. Commercial director John Bonito helmed his first feature. He keeps the pacing going well. I had no clue who John Cena was, and wondered how he grabbed an action lead. After seeing the DVD extras of his wrestling career, I understand how he was cast and remembered him from channel surfing. His reactions are fairly wooden without many levels that we'd expect from a more experienced actor. But he gets an \"A\" for effort and completed many of his own stunts.Robert Patrick who was the bad guy in \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" and had a small part in Clint Eastwood's \"Flags of Our Fathers\" plays the bad guy Rome who engineers a bank heist. Patrick looks like he's smart enough to plan the caper, but has a screw loose enough to result in the chaos and trail of bodies.Kelly Carlson from \"Nip & Tuck\" and many appearances on \"CSI\" plays Kate Triton, the wife who gets abducted. The brief love scenes looked like both actors were having fun and convinced us of a romantic relationship, although there wasn't much more marital emotional depth beyond that. She looked great.Her female nemesis is played by Abigail Bianca who portrays the trigger happy gang moll with expertise. She excels at the action sequences. My favorite shot in the film is when she is flung through glass and diamonds are scattered, some of them red with blood.The very best performance in the film, however, is one of the gang members named Bennett. Creatively named, he is played by New Zealand actor Manu Bennett. He seems to be the one in the gang with intelligence and emotional realism. His fight scene with John Cena is excellent. I was sad to see him bite the dust.Overall, the film was about what I expected. Perhaps the acting wasn't quite as good as I'd anticipated. However, it picked me up in the action and carried me through swamps and explosions to the final frame. I enjoyed the DVD extra showing the film premiere at the military base with our fighting men and women. This is a good film for an evening's entertainment. Enjoy!",

There's nothing new or really eye popping to see here. It is a formula driven testerone fest that does all the usual things that movies like this are supposed to do and it is all pulled off fairly well.

After watching this movie it left me quite speechless. War is entirely different, and should not be made glamorous for recruiting purposes.\"The Marine\" is a very simple film with a few minor twists here and there. In the tradition of The Rock, John Cena has begun a movie career after gaining notoriety as a wrestler. Both wrestlers/actors are muscle bound former college football players. Whereas The Rock has now proven he can act in a variety of roles, Cena has just proven that he can do action. His role in \"The Marine\" is evidence that he may very well be successful in films, but he will need to find better material than this. The directing here is nothing special, but seeing this is John Bonito's first feature, I have nothing to support my cause as I have nothing more to base it on, but he is able to deliver a film that is very easy and even if Bonito got a little explosion happy. The plot however, is pointless. Throughout this movie these imbecile thieves call attention to themselves every chance they get. After robbing a jewelry store, they don't just stroll away as no one outside knows what they did. They blow up a cop car. Why? I have no idea. One member of the group is prone to telling sad stories of his youth. Too often the camera lingers on the bad guys and then quickly gives us a shot of Cena running. Sure, Patrick is a bigger movie star than Cena, but this is Cena's movie. I really did not care about the bad guys other than how Cena is going to kick their [...].I will say that Cena has the build and look of an action hero in the grain of Jean-Claude Van Damme. He fits right in with the 'unstoppable 80's action hero mold.' He is 90% muscle and 10% charm. He has few lines of dialogue but does well enough with what he has. Robert Patrick hammed it up, but seemed to relish playing a wise-cracking psychotic murderer. No one else is worth mentioning, as it seems paychecks were just collected. Cena, who is also a rapper, had also been wearing military attire at his matches. No doubt he is doing so for publicity sake of this movie, which celebrates Marines as heroes which is great but nothing he can do is going to generate enough interest to make \"The Marine\" a success.",

    "review/text": "Last night, I sat comfortably on the sofa at home to watch two action movies consecutively on Star Movies Channel.The two movies share one common feature: They were no-brainers! That is to say, they were pure entertainment, & best of all, you don't need a brain to figure out what the story in each movie was all about.Once in a while, I like to watch no-brainer movies, just for the fun of it. Sometimes, just for random stimuli. so to speak!The two movies were:- 'The Marine', starring John Cena & Robert Patrick;- 'Transporter 2', starring Jason Statham;The first movie was, to me, beautifully choreographed with fiery pyrotechnics & gun blazing actions all the way, from start to finish. There wasn't a dull moment.It had a very simple story plot: A gang of merciless diamond robbers on the run, kidnapped the wife of a recently discharged US marine from Iraq, who later went on a long chase through the marshland & wilderness of South Carolina to save her.At the onset, I did not realised that the movie was actually a promotional vehicle for the people behind those seemingly senseless head-banging & body-crushing wrestling tournaments on television. John Cena was one of those guys.Since I don't like to watch any of their televised wrestling matches, I got to see, at least in this action movie, a lot of his wrestling manoeuvres as he threw those robbers & some other bad guys who stood in his way.Acting-wise, John Cena was somewhat kayu (a colloquial term for 'wooden'), but he had quite a naturally likable disposition. He certainly reminds me of Dwayne Johnson, known as The Rock, the wrestling guy turned actor (e.g. 'The Scorpion King', 'Walking Tall', 'The Rundown', 'Doom', just to name a few), especially with the cheeky wink.Physically, John Cena was huge, but who cares, as long as he could fight & clobber the bad guys in the movie.I reckon the only actor who really stood out in the movie was Robert Patrick, who played the leader of the robbers. He had certainly put on a lot of weight, when compared to the first time I saw him in the second part of the Terminator trilogy, as model T1000. I also recall him as an FBI agent in the 'X-Files' television series.This movie actually reminds me of two two action movies I had watched before, namely, 'The Punisher', starring Thomas Jane as a DEA agent turned vigilante, Frank Castle, & 'The Mechanik', starring Dolph Lundgren as Nikolai Cherenko, an ex-operative from the Russian Special Forces.Together with 'The Marine', they shared one unique & yet common feature: It's all about the adventurous exploits of a one-man fighting &/or destruction machine!The second movie was actually a sequel to 'Transporter', also starring the same actor.Both 'Transporter' movies were apparently hemmed by the famous French action director, Luc Besson, famous for his action flicks, 'Taxi I to IV'.His other movie credits also included 'Nikita', 'The Professional', 'Kiss of the Dragon' (with Jet Li in starring role), 'Wasabi', 'Unleashed' (again with Jet Li in starring role) & 'Hitman' (which I had not yet watched);In both the 'Transporter' movies, Jason Statham played Frank Martin, a retired US Special Forces operative, now turned mercenary transporter of cargo & people, with no questions asked.In this particular one, he was unwittingly implicated in an engineered kidnap attempt of a young boy he was supposed to protect. The young boy was the son of a powerful US government official, involved in cross-border anti-narcotics policy making.The bad guys were the Colombian drug cartel, who had financed a team of rogues led by a real nut case, called Gianni, who had injected a deadly virus into our hero to force him to do all the dirty work.The rest of the movie centred on our hero fighting for his life, as he systematically tracked down & eventually neutralised all the bad guys, while also succeeding in getting the young boy out of harm's way. It was quite fun to watch our hero replicating some of Jackie Chan's signature fighting antics in the movie.I read that Jason Statham had some sort of martial arts background, which probably explained his physical prowess & agility, just like Jean Claude van Damme, in the fighting sequences.For me, the best action sequence in the movie was the segment, when our hero drove his beefed-up Audi up an incline to fly into the air, with an ingenious somersault manoeuvre to dislodge a time-bomb attached to the under portion of the car, with the timely aid of a large hook suspended from a harbour crane located nearby. Wow, that was really cool!Just like the first movie, there wasn't a dull moment in this one, as it was also beautifully choreographed with adrenalin-pumping action sequences throughout, from start to finish.Acting-wise, Jason Statham probably fared better than John Cena in my view. His many acting credits included 'Ghosts of Mars', 'The One' (with Jet Li), 'Italian Job', 'Cellular', 'Chaos', 'Crank' & latest 'Rogue Assassins' (with Jet Li, which I have yet to watch).The bottomline of my movie review: The two action movies, although seemingly no-brainers, have been real fun to watch, at least for me. If you like sheer action & pure entertainment, they won't disappoint you. Guaranteed!",

    "review/text": "I am afraid that some reviews I have seen show either an anti-military bias or else expect things of this movie they would not demand of others of its type. The movie is not political in ANY way, but there is a fairly heroic brief starting episode in Iraq; I guess some don't like that.This is in fact a terrific action/adventure movie in the mold of the Rambo or Schwarzenegger films (eg \"Commando\") or the Indiana Jones series. The violence is not accurate in depiction of results, but neither is it in any movie where female stars takes full-power strikes and come bouncing back. If reality counted in the movies, there would be no girl-star action movies.The violence is actually toned down in favor of action. For example, Sgt. Triton chooses to takes out two very tough villains in exciting brawls when he has a good fighting knife with him. Reality would have been different .... and much bloodier. Not much gore or blood in this picture, however, and you can safely take your pre-teen or teen son. Or yourself. My wife liked it, too, for that matter.The acting was top-drawer within the context of the plot. I never heard of John Cena,so I can't be considered biased. Triton was seen first in front of his commanding officer, then interacting with his wife. He was supposed to be emotionally restrained with his commander, and strong but a little reflective with his wife. He was. Then The Marine had a mission. He had to complete it, not emote and burst into tears. After the adrenalin high wore off, he'd probably start shaking, but while things were going on, he didn't have time to be upset. Man, haven't the sweetie-boys who have panned his acting ever been in a fight? I never heard of the star,but he turned in a very believable good performance for the part. The excellent-looking wife did a fine job as well. No nudity in this movie. Unfortunately.In sum, a fine example of its type and highly recommended for all. It requires some suspension of belief, but most action movies do. It will grab you hard and keep you watching.",

    "review/text": "The Marine is a no holds barred action vehicle filled with cardboard characters and a plot straight out of an episode of the 1980's G.I. Joe cartoon. Yeah, there are plot holes, logic bombs and more cheesy dialogue than Kraft could put in a dozen commercials, but this doesn't stop the movie from being a lot of fun to watch.WWE wrestling superstar John Cena plays John Triton, a U.S. Marine who has been scapegoated and dishonorably discharged for disobeying an order from commanding officers and is making an adjustment to civilian life with his hot wife. He gets a job at a security firm where...he gets fired for disobeying an order. After this mishap he and his wife decide to go away where at a gas station they run afoul of some diamond smugglers who kill a cop and kidnap take his wife for a hostage so they can make their getaway. In the quest to get her back, Triton goes through car chases, explosions, and death defying scenarios. It's best not to take these too seriously; this is the kind of action movie where you turn your brain off and enjoy the show.Despite the logic holes, The Marine reminds me of the kind of old-fashioned action movie I used to watch back in the late 1980's-1990's like American Ninja or Ninja III: The Domination (WHY ISN'T THIS ON DVD YET!) Low budget movies that were full of over the top stunts, car chases, big explosions and clich&eacute; lines from the heroes. The kind of movie you turn your brain off for two hours and unwind with. The kind of movies I'd watch on a Saturday afternoon when I had nothing else to doJohn Cena is fun to watch as Triton, he has great charisma and a strong screen presence that keeps you watching in spite of the campy script. He shows the potential to be a solid B-action star in the not unlike Michael Dudikoff or Michael Pare. Kelly Carson is good as Triton's wife. She does the best she can with the weak script she's given. Robert Patrick takes his character way over the top The rest of the cast here is fodder for Triton to kill or beat up.If you catch this on TV one Saturday afternoon, after you've done the shopping or are coming back from a late night date don't miss it. The Marine is the perfect movie to kill some time or catch for a nightcap.",

    "review/text": "This is rather fun to watch although it is completely over the top in being unrealistic.Although most action shows tend to be extreme in the situations that the star survives and thrives in, this one puts virtually all others to shame in that regard. That is unfortunate as it is a storyline that could have proven to be a great movie if it were written better.It features John Triton (John Cena) as a former Marine who was kicked out of the Corps for disobeying an order. Of course, had he obeyed the order, many American lives would have been lost. Nevertheless, he was scapegoated and discharged.One day he and his wife Kate (Kelly Carlson) are at a convenience store when a group of thugs kills a cop. They then take Kate hostage, which proves to be a very poor decision for them as John is a commando the makes Rambo look like a wimp in comparison. The bad guys are about to have a very bad day indeed.This really could have been a great show, but there are way too many extreme fires/explosions that get Triton. If the writers would have toned that part down just a bit, this might have been a four or even a five star show. Hardcore actions fans will probably enjoy it, but it comes off as a bit too hokey for many others.",

I don't see the differance is between the unrated version and the rated version but it still a great action experience.I think John Cena should stick to being an action star besides wresling because fans would want to see him in future actions movies as a tough man.

He's nearly blown up 3 times, lives through a car chase where the car ends up being swiss cheese torn to pieces. The acting wasn't too bad, but they tried to put humor in that I think only a WWE fan would appreciate. There was one funny moment I liked that referenced Terminator. It's a decent action movie if you just put logic aside and enjoy the ride. I'm not a wrestling fan, so most of actors were unknown to me. It's worth a rent just for the car chase.",

    "review/text": "\"The Marine\" reminds me of the old-fashioned action films made in the 1980s like Arnold Schwarzenegger's \"Commando.\" If you remember this film, our hero is a retired elite commando, single-handedly saves the kidnapped daughter, and kills all the bad guys. The story is incredible, I know, but fun nonetheless.In \"The Marine\" WWE's John Cena plays that hero John Triton, a marine discharged for disobeying the direct orders. The difference here is that the hero has to rescue his wife kidnapped by the diamond robbers and the gangs' leader is played by Robert Patrick. And watching \"Commando\" is more fun.Frankly I don't care the wooden acting of the cast and the predicable (and unrealistic) story as long as the film provides good actions. Actually I found John Cena is not that bad as critics say, and Kelly Carlson as his wife did a fine job. Also \"The Marine\" has one car chases with good stunt and one funny one-liner about Robert Patrick's career making role.But things start to look silly when these actions are drawn-out. There are scenes big explosions, but they only help lower the film's tension as the poorly-written storyline and choppy editing make it clear that none of these poses a danger to the protagonist who can easily survive and go to the next set-piece. Moreover, it's not exciting to see the baddies fighting among them more then once. It's not thrilling to watch them trudging through thick mud of the swamp, either.\"The Marine\" is an old-school action film that needs someone capable of handling the materials (themselves not bad) in a much better form.",

For example Fat Chance Bellydance for American Tribal style or Aisha Ali for African dance or someone well known for Egyptian or Turkish Caberet. If this is a serious investment for you-get a good tape, beginner or otherwise if you search around you will find several.",

But that is one of the beauties of the tape. If you want to dance in the privacy of your home or if you are thinking of taking lessons, I think this would be great for you. It is a very gentle tape. Do not be fooled by the 1996 date listed here. That must be the reprint date, my tape said 1985 which explains the dated hair and makeup. Atea is not the most animated speaker but I think that is in line with gentle nature of the tape. I think the tape is very much in the spirit of belly dancing as it encourages the viewer to use her own style.",

    "review/text": "Bellydancing is an ancient art form. Its origins can be traced to India, Africa and Polynesia. This dance is suitable for all ages and body types. The fluid graceful movement provides focused exercise for the pelvic, hip and stomach regions. When you add the arm movements, this exercise is expressive and creative. The first section of the video gives some of the historical background to this dance.The arm techniques will give you more flexibility and strength. As you move your entire body, the natural movements will exercise every muscle in the body. It will especially strengthen the abdominal muscles. While you are dancing away your belly, you will also notice improved posture and self-confidence.For this video, you don't need any exotic costumes, although the ones the dancers wear are absolutely the best I have ever seen. You may want to buy a scarf for one of the latter sections to learn veil techniques. Finger cymbals are also used, but you can just pretend you have them.This exercise video begins with a warm-up, then Atea shows you all the basic moves. The 5 dancers featured in this video show you how to incorporate the basic moves into a more free-style dance. There is no fancy footwork and the dancers are quite good. All the moves are easy to learn, but will take time to incorporate into your own dance routine.Bellydancing is a low-impact exercise, yet you can feel you are getting a great workout. You will start with stretching, head rolls and some basic warm-up exercises. Then you move a section where you learn basic hip movements. You will then learn to isolate and control various muscle groups. If you wear comfortable clothing, you will be able to accomplish all the moves. There is music in the background, but it isn't the focus.Bellydancing is healthy for the mind, body and spirit. If you want to put a little oriental spice into your exercise routing, this is not at all a traditional workout. It is very enjoyable and not at all fast paced. Take your time and enjoy the dances that were born at the beginning of time.~The Rebecca Review",

    "review/text": "I really wanted to like this video. I TRIED to like this video, tried to keep in mind that it was filmed in the mid-80's, but I just can't help feeling disappointed. What I spent on this tape could have paid for 2 weeks of classes, which would have done me more good. Specifically: it lacked a structured warmup. A complete beginner would need to be taught the warm up exercises as well as the dance moves. And the pacing was uneven -- I was expecting a workout tape that I could pop in, watch once, then rewind and work out with. Instead, it was an instructional tape which left it to the individual to build her own workout. Great if that's what you're looking for, but a disappointment to someone like me, who hadn't danced in 15 years and is starting over from scratch. Finally, Atea's speech and mannerisms were distracting -- while she is a good dancer, she is too stiff and stilted when speaking, and was obviously reading from cue cards. She would have done better to rehearse more, or to have someone else do the instructions in a voiceover.",

The ad boast all the costume changes, but since this was filmed in the '80's, we are talking Jane Fonda meets Pat Benetar with Green eyeshadow. The video covers alot of ground, but the flow is all wrong if you want to learn to bellydance. The warm-up is 3 bellydancers stretching freestyle, with no instruction whatsoever, with a voice over stating that you should warm-up. The different instructions(about 5 minutes) are followed by a performance( about 5 minutes) that breaks the flow of a workout, or simply trying to learn something. The performances are not a guided routine or combining the moves you just learned, but a performance. In the veil section, she doesn't even break down the moves, but has different dancers doing demonstrations. I would have given it only one star, but the opening is a history of bellydance that is quite interesting. The video comes off as an overview of bellydance more than an instructional video. My favorites of the videos I bought were The Sensual Workout and The Goddess Workout.",

    "review/text": "If you're looking for a video to workout along with, this is probably not going to be what you're looking for. If you're looking to learn a few moves, you might pick up a few. Atea is extremely stiff through the entire video, and sometimes looks unbalanced. You can't see hers or the dancers' legs much of the time sometimes due to camera angles, mostly due to costuming, so you're not always sure you're executing the move correctly if you don't already know what you're doing. At the end of every section Atea and the other 2 dancers behind her simply &quot;improv&quot; a little dance using the moves taught. You can't see what everyone is doing through the &quot;improv&quot; sections so it's not like you could pick one dancer and imitate her, so you will have to do your own thing, fast forward through it, or improv yourself. I don't think most beginners want to make things up as they go along after only 5 minutes of being shown 3 moves. The section on veil work doesn't tell you much of anything at all, it just shows you different women dancing and spinning. For a beginner who doesn't know how to execute a turn without making herself dizzy, following what the dancers do could wind up with a really nice concussion, but not much learning.Out of 10 videos in my bellydance library, this one is the absolute worst. I recommend anyone else's over this.",

I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to &quot;freestyle&quot; and &quot;improvisation&quot;. I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish. Some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated. On the positive side, the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful, especially the belly roll and undulations. I was really struggling with those, and I'm now confidently on my way. I wish they had covered more moves in that manner. Bottom line- it's been a week, and I'm already seeking out another video to buy.",

    "review/text": "At&eacute;a's approach is friendly, encouraging, and thorough. The costumes are great -- very inspiring. Unfortunately, there is no choreography, and the music isn't very Middle Eastern. However, it's still a very good intro to belly dance, with an encouraging attitude. It's great for the beginner with no access to classes. At&eacute;a's approach is to let the music guide the movement, so no choreographed movements are taught. If you like a bit more structure in your instruction, this is not the video for you.The box maintains that it is a \"complete home course\" with beginner through advanced moves. In it, you will learn basic movements, as well as veil and zill work. The various movements are demonstrated regularly throughout the video by At&eacute;a and other dancers.The final&eacute; features dancers in yet another costume change (there are 50 costumes shown in this video), dancing solos in a joyful atmosphere of friendship. You get the sense that every one of those women is having the time of her life, and that she loves this dance.I would recommend this as a first foray into Middle Eastern dance, especially if you have no way of taking a class with a \"live\" instructor. The movements she teaches are basic, true, but provide a good foundation, and the encouragement to experiment. I enjoyed her approach, even after having taken a class.",

    "review/text": "A friend recommended this to me as the best instructional video to really learn bellydance and she was right. Atea's Magical Motion is unique compared to other bellydance videos I own and have tried. The video starts with a brief, informative history of bellydance, which reveals a few facts that I know I wasn't aware of, including its health benefits.This video appeals to the type of learner that I am. Even my instructor has commented that I take my time to learn something before moving on. Atea teaches in small segments, showing us 3 or 4 related movements at a time. Her analogies work very well for me; for instance, imagining that I'm tracing a figure eight on the floor or a clock on the wall. She takes time with each movement and encourages us not to focus too hard or get frustrated, pointing out that bellydance should be relaxed and fun, and that perfection will come in its own time.Some other reviewers felt that Atea is a bit \"stiff.\" I think that this is because she spends a lot of time explaining the movements verbally and sometimes the visual has to wait catch up. If you watch the beginning segment closely, you'll see that Atea and the other two dancers are trying not to burst out laughing because they're standing in stance for such a long time waiting for the narrative to finish.While Atea reminds us of the health and fitness benefits of bellydance, she is also teaching real, genuine bellydance with all of its joy and freedom. While it will work you out because bellydance is great exercise, this is not a \"workout\" video. Personally, I'm experiencing positive changes in the shape of my body while having tons of fun and without really trying, a great bonus.After each segment, Atea basically says, \"Okay, now let's dance,\" showing us how to put the moves together with other dancers, who rotate with each section. In addition to learning and practicing the basic moves, watching other dancers is another important part of learning. Atea shows us a variety of dancers with many different styles to inspire us.Following segments on staccato hip movements, taxim, arms and a little taste of veil work and zills, we are treated to an incredible costume fashion show with dancers of all shapes, ages, sizes and ethnicity. Both the veil segment and the costume piece will give you lots of ideas for putting your own moves and look together.The end of the video is my favorite part. Atea points out that the heart of bellydance is really about friends getting together to share fun, joy and creativity and we are given a glimpse of a hafla. All of the dancers in the video show us their stuff. This is how my instructor teaches, encouraging freestyle dancing during breaks, after class and at weekly hafla. We learn from and encourage each other.I was drawn to my own instructor due to her passion and and love for bellydance, a passion that Atea seems to share. The first time I saw my teacher dance, she was smiling like she was having the time of her life. I've met other instructors over the years and none got me motivated enough to actually show up at their studios. I called her at The Hippie Shack in Tulsa, OK less than two weeks later to enroll. Bellydance has literally saved my life after the loss of my husband six months ago, bringing enough joy and passion back into my life to keep me from drowning in depression.If you attend classes as a beginner, Magical Motion will help you supplement what's being taught. If you're not interested in classes or can't attend, this video is one of the best for learning bellydance in the absence of professional instruction.",

Some pelvic movements, walking movements and shimmies. There is a very basic intro to zils (finger cymbals) and a breif veil section. They show you some costumes rather than tell you much about costuming.Lacking:They dont explain differences in styles of bellydance, for instance the tape covers what could be considered egyptian caberet but you are not told this and they dont mention alternatives like tribal style.The music is very new age throughout and thats fine but they never play any traditional music at all.They use words like ethnic costuming when they could tell you she is wearing a thobe. At the same time these are all very cabaret costumes which is fine but they should touch lightly at least on some other style options.Finally these gals look very 80's in their choice of hair styles and makeup which gives you the feel that this tape is old and maybe it is but the set is very lovely.My advice is if you can find an instructor, do so! Bellydance is great fun when you have a group of ladies together. In classes you can ask questions and get good exposure to other trends in middle eastern dance. If you cannot find an instructor read up and decide what style of dance you want to start learning first. If egyptian is it than this is definatly worth it, despite the hair =)!",

I hope Atea will make an updated version of this tape.In the event she updates the video, my suggestions for improvement would be:1. Move the history of the dance to the end of the tape, merely because when you are using it as a workout video, it's a pain to have to fast-forward past that portion every time you want to dance.2. More full-body shots so one can see exactly what a dancer is doing with feet, arms, etc., rather than focusing on one part.3. Atea is a good dancer, but she is stilted when speaking in the video and obviously reading cue-cards. I think she should stick to the dancing demonstrations and do a separate voice-over for instructions, or better yet, use someone with a more relaxed and natural voice for instructions.",

The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh is a pretty good giallo, I'd give the film itself 3 stars. If you didn't buy the out of print NoShame disc this may be a good option.It will be interesting to see if this is indeed the same transfer from NoShame and if it will include the great extras from that disc. Also, if it isn't a new transfer and doesn't have the extras, it will be funny that the NoShame disc from five years ago was list priced at $19.95 while this is listed as $24.95!Time will tell but beware of this shady company, who charges more and gives you less.",

    "review/summary": "A great answer to a simple question",
    "review/text": "San Francisco Bay Area filmmaker James E. Manning and co-producer Shely Pack have created an extraordinary look into what inspires kids to pursue the fantastical world of dance and why it can drive some parents totally nuts. Why Dance is a simple question that gets answered in simple cinematic terms. Focusing on the subject of Ballet, Manning aims his camera straight at the creators of this magnificent art form - its dancers, directors, choreographers and coaches. Manning pushes through the illusions, beyond the stage scenery, and demands more than a conventional response. His 6-chapter documentary is a finely-tuned balance of keynote questions, edgy concerns, light and humorous insights, unhesitating honesty and vigorous imagery. His guests are long-careered world class dancers and choreographers, multi-talented judges and coaches, young prodigies from established companies and neighborhood studios, and a set of still-amazed parents suddenly yanked into social change, daunting challenges, stupefying commitments, and finally - blessed acceptance. Within this nearly 2-hour presentation are the blistering facts about physical training, pain and tolerance of pain, pirates and pirouettes, to eat or not to eat, trophies and tutus, tights and toe shoes.As director, editor, narrator, and composer of the film's incidental music, James E. Manning demonstrates a sharp sense of style, rhythm and timing. The overall tone of Why Dance is warm and inviting, his expert storytellers are engaging and persuasive. Personal anecdotes are bolstered with footage of class work-outs, dress rehearsals and a competition dance routine. Manning's editing is like fine choreography - the separate transitions flow together gracefully with ease and purpose.Why Dance is the perfect gift for the family with that special child who begins moving whenever music is in the air. This documentary merits a spot in every library in every neighborhood and in every school. As the Fine Arts Critic for The San Francisco Sentinel, it is my privilege to cover San Francisco Ballet. The Company attracts and employs the best dancers in the world. Each dancer started in a class with other kids who were probably bouncing off the walls and using common hallways as personal runways. They all know the answer to - Why Dance?By Se&aacute;n MartinfieldSan Francisco, CA",

    "review/text": "This is a very new ballet documentary with many interviews of students and parents on the joys and sacrifices of dancing ballet. There are many fine scenes of dance routines and the technical proficiency of these dancers is very impressive, indeed. Such is the state of ballet in the 21st century! Several aspects are covered, such as training, family support(or the lack of it), competition, injuries, and eating disorders. This is certainly long enough(almost two hours), but my only criticism is that in many of the interviews we see the person seated in a chair for almost the entire segment, instead of having them talk over scenes of dancing. As a ballet dancer myself, when people start to talk about dancing, I want to see dancing while I listen to them(or else I feel the need to get up and dance myself!). There certainly should have been enough of available footage for this. As it is, it is still an excellent, American look at ballet.",

There's not a subject that can't be picked by the absortion of it, since society v. the individual are depicted honestly and naturally.This is a great work, of the kind of masterpieces of other genres: painting (Irish west coast); literature (with the eternal characters that compound the human canvas, as in another Shakespeare plot); music (Maurice Jarre's score fits perfectly).But to me the most important thing about it is that, continually, the movie was reminding me of different scenes from the New Testament. So this is a 'real-as-life' movie. The Pharisees (politicians and their idolaters) one the one hand, and the individual or victim (Christ, the adulterous woman, the innocent child...) on the other.History repeats itself. But Christ not only will judge the individual, but also the nations, according to what they have done the His Son. You could talk of so many subjects after watching this beautiful film that you'd never end. You have from pride, treason, sexual lust, ignorance, cruelty etc. to sacrifice, forgiveness, God's creation of nature, spirituality, duty, devotion, humbleness, innocence, kindness, love.The most perfect moment: when the village idiot receives a goodbye kiss from the adulterous wife.",

When I finally did so I was staggered at my stupidity and the beauty and breadth of Lean's film.What can I say now but see this film! It's one of the masterpieces of colour cinema. The setting, the politics of Irish nationalism at odds with the occupying British forces, the parallel stories of two kinds of love; there's just layer on layer of intrigue and complexity here, and even with its mighty length, nothing extraneous or long-winded exists in it.There's so much in this movie, it puts most modern films to shame. It's not just in the story. The sheer power of the coastal landscape and its colour; the wonderful array of characters, even if there's a paucity of genuine Irish actors among the cast. Sarah Miles, a great and perhaps underrated actress, is unbelievable in her passion, a woman seeking a deeper connection with love than others around her, which leads her into big trouble. Mitchum is stoic and full of compassion and grace as her husband the schoolteacher; Trevor Howard plays the Catholic priest to the core; Leo McKern as Ryan the (re)publication sits well, and John Mills fills the shoes of a Shakespeare-like fool admirably.Lean was a great interpreter of Charles Dickens' novels in the 1940s: those films stayed with me from childhood. I liked Brief Encounter but found it too dated; I was ambivalent about Lawrence of Arabia and found Passage to India a bit too drawn out. I guess that's what I feared with this film, that it was about a world and time (WWI) in which I was not interested, done in that exegetic style of Lean's for which I never really thought I had the time. After all, the full-length version is 204 minutes, and that's a lot of film for one sitting.If you have the time, and like big experiences, with strong characters and emotional and political depth, this is the film for you.",

Whether we're talking about the ilicit affair between Rosy(Sarah Miles), the frustrated teachers wife, and a shellshocked British officer or the anti-British fervor among the locals the emotions are large here. Scriptwriter Robert Bolt fashions a script here that is deep in characterization. The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent with probably Robert Mitchum's staid teacher, Trevor Howard's consciencious priest, and John Mills' simpleton being the standouts.

It was quite amazing, and one must commend the great David Lean for taking a relatively simple story and giving it legitimate epic stature. Oscar-winning cinematography and a glorious score by Lean regular, Maurice Jarre, add to the magnificence. The never nominated Sir John Mills won a most deserved Oscar; indeed, I didn't know it was him until the final credits rolled. Sarah Miles also received her only nomination, in a complex performance that is nothing short of perfection. After reading other reviews, no one mentioned the great Robert Mitchum who, pressured to get married, realizes that his young bride would soon be bored by his sexual impotence. He's probably the least concerned when her infidelity is brought to light. The beautiful Christopher Jones certainly made a mark; too bad he gave up on a film career. And I agree with a previous reviewer that Lean's \"A Passage to India\" was sorely neglected. Everyone praises \"Kwai\", \"Lawrence\" & \"Zhivago\", but I find I've watched \"Passage\" much more than those others. \"Ryan's Daughter\" was also nominated for \"Best Sound\". Indeed, the turbulence of the Irish coast is almost a character unto itself. I'm very pleased that this film is coming out on a 2-disc DVD. I only wish I had a big-screen TV, but I'm also pleased that I had the opportunity to see it on the big screen, where its power blew me away. UPDATE, 11-8-08: Watched it again, and loved it as much",

A relevant fact is that the screenwriter, Robert Bolt, was married to Sarah Miles, the actress who played Rose. They later divorced, and rumors had it that their relationship was the inspiration for the script. If so, Bolt rose above his personal pain in heroic fashion, because the straying wife in the movie is depicted very sympathetically.The movie received bad reviews originally, most famously from Pauline Kael. Since I haven't read her review, I'm not sure what her complaint was. I've always suspected that it didn't click with audiences at the time because Robert Mitchum was cast completely against type. Up to that point he had been one of the movies' sexiest leading men and always got the girl. In Ryan's daughter he was the older, cuckolded husband, who seems to be sexually repressed. I think this was too much of a shock for his fans (which probably included all adult filmgoers of the time.) Audiences don't like reminders of their own mortality. My God! Mitchum is that old?? Yet it was one of the most powerful performances of his life. He even managed a fine Irish accent.Also,the political situation between the British and Irish at that time may have confused American audiences, who probably thought Ireland was part of England and couldn't figure out why the picturesque locals hated the handsome soldier. Why are all those people with British accents (?) shooting at their own soldiers? The fact that it was happening during World War One was probably also confusing to Americans, who don't know their own history, much less Ireland's. And yet, the inter-relationship between the political events and the two love stories is perfectly handled by the script. In nearly all other war movies, the love story seems pitifully out of place. The audience simply can't figure out how that beautiful woman got herself into that battle, nor how she manages to keep her dress so spotless in the midst of all that mud! Or,if a love story throws in some historical events, it all seems like boring, unnecessary exposition. Here every word counts. Every scene between the lovers raises the sexual tension, and every scene with the Irish and the soldiers raises the stakes for everyone.There are two scenes in this movie which vault it into the best-of-all-time category. Both are the work of Robert Bolt, the scriptwriter, and both are entirely visual, with no dialogue. Both include the village idiot, a mute.SPOILER FOLLOWSIn the first of these two scenes, the handsome soldier, new in town, stops in the pub to have a drink, trying to make friends with the locals. Rose, the barmaid, tries to be rude, since she has been taught to hate the British, but you can tell she is attracted. They are alone in the pub, except for the crazy mute, who begins to swing his leg mindlessly, banging it against the bar. It startles the soldier. Bang, bang, bang, in perfect merciless rhythm. The soldier tries to ignore it. The mute is happy, clueless. Bang, bang, bang. The soldier begins to crumble in front of our eyes as we see flashbacks of him in a trench in France, cringing in terror during a bombardment. Finally, he collapses, gasping on the floor, suffering a full-blown panic attack. Rose rushes to his aid, comforting him until his breathing slows and the horror leaves his eyes. It is a shockingly intimate moment, and entirely non-sexual. Yet after that moment, they are intimate, and they know it. He recovers, apologetic and confused, and leaves the pub. Rose thinks she knows why he was transferred from the Western Front to her sleepy Irish village: he was a coward under fire. But wait, he wears the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for bravery....The second of these perfect, wordless scenes is carefully prepared. The mute begins to imitate the new captain. He begins to follow him, marching in his clumsy way, saluting. And he puts bottle caps and ribbons on the breast of his tattered clothes to imitate the soldier's decorations. The villagers understand. Ah, he is imitating the captain. One day he is doing his impersonation in the main street, and the villagers are laughing. Rose appears and the mute walks up to her and puckers up, expecting a kiss. Suddenly, the villagers know the horrible truth about their Rose. The mute has seen her kissing the captain! Rose instantly knows that she has been betrayed, and that there is nothing she can say in her defense. From this point on, the concluding tragedy is inevitable.These two wordless scenes are perfect cinema and earned John Mills (the mute) an Oscar. There is a third instance of a major plot point being made visually, that is nearly as good. There is dialogue, but it is used by the characters to hide rather than reveal. Rose has been out riding her horse. Her husband says \"Where did you go?\" She replies, \"To the mountains.\" She is in the other room, removing her riding clothes. He says, \"So, you didna go to the beach, then?\" She says again, \"No, to the mountains.\" Then a closeup reveals that he is looking at her hat, which she left on the kitchen table. He is looking at the grains of sand on the bill of the hat. We see his face, we know that he knows she is lying, and why, and we also know that he will not confront her. These three scenes define the difference between books and movies. They are so perfect I can't figure out why Steven Spielberg hasn't stolen them.Another point that irritated the politically correct critics was the horrible punishment of the unfaithful wife, which seemed so Victorian in the hip 1970s. I would like to point out that Rose is not punished for adultery but for treason, and that she is innocent. Furthermore, she chooses not to save herself by revealing the name of the real traitor.I haven't seen this movie in thirty-seven years and I have never forgotten those scenes, and many, many others. Aside from the story and the characters, it also has the incredible photography that you can see in every David Lean movie. I'll bet a million people have visited the west of Ireland to experience personally the incredible landscapes they first saw in \"Ryan's Daughter.",

Lean was so devastated that he didn't direct another film for 14 years. As usual, critics have shown their ignorance once again (like on Heaven's Gate). This is a great epic film, with some of the most intense scenes ever committed to celluloid. The storm sequences, which took months to film, is brilliant. There were no trick shots used. No CGI (this was 1970). Everything you see is real, which makes it even more fantastic. The performances are wonderful all around, Freddie Young's 70mm photography is fabulous, and Lean's direction assured. Especially telling is Robert Mitchum, who gives a wonderfully understated performance, in total contrast to his tough guy image. Lean is a master craftsman/artist, and this film is fabulous. Many people have posted good reviews here, and kudos to them. Ignore critics. If you want to see a film, see it. Too often critics are way behind the curve...",

They marry and her life is not what she expects until a British Officer enters it while she is tending bar. The chap is played by Christopher Jones who was the Colin Farrell of his day. The scene in the pub when they meet is one of the most tender loving scenes ever filmed. The affair that follows brings heartache to all. The villagers in this small Irish town gives lynch mobs a bad name. The pleasure they exact from teasing the village idiot(played by John Mills and may I add with beauty and heart) and later taking their revenge on an innocent person they believed to be the traitor. I don't want to give away the ending ot the story but I just purchased it and watched it for the first time in thirty years and was reminded what a storyteller David Lean was. Candace Serviss",

    "review/text": "Ryan's Daughter is a wonderful, sensual love story set on the rugged, west sea coast of Ireland. It is about community, religion, tradition, youth, discovery, want, war and infidelity. And Sarah Miles is very sexy in her roll as the disillusioned Rose.Rose is a young woman who is trying to come to terms with adulthood and sexuality in the small world of an Irish village. There arn't many good young men around so she has her sights set on an older, single, male schoolteacher, played by Robert Mitchum. Well, after a fanciful marriage and still a virgin, Rose discovers that the teacher isn't such a hot lover, which leaves Rose a bit disappointed.\"There must be more.\" She tells her priest, played by Trevor Howard.\"Be careful what you ask for Rose.\" he tells her, \"Because as sure as hell you'll get it.\"And then the movie starts.When this film first came out, I was so spellbound by it that I went to the cinema to see it repeatedly, unlike any other movie. I became totally absorbed in the sheer epic of such a simple love story: the photography, the sensitivity, the location and the characters. Why couldn't other film-makers tell a story with such grace, style and sensuality? Well, I found out that other film-makers didn't have the big budgets that Director David Lean had. So I wonder, could David Lean have made a film on a small budget? Thank God he didn't. We have been left such a rich legacy of fine films from this master craftsman.Critique Pauline Kael panned Ryan's Daughter so badly when it first came out and David Lean took it so hard and personally, that he didn't make another film for fourteen years. Perhaps Ms Kael wasn't sensitive but Mr. Lean's sensitivity shows through more in this film than with most others he's made. Thank you for your artistry Mr. Lean.Recently, while on a trip to Western Ireland I made a pilgrimage to the end of the Dingle Peninsula where they filmed Ryan's Daughter. Unbelievably, the schoolhouse is still standing where they built it for the movie in 1969, in a farmer's field, on the hillside overlooking the sea. And it's still in good shape, as if the film crew had left it standing yesterday.",

I have 4 all-time fave directors, and the other 3 are Hitchcock, Kubrick, and Kurosawa. If you share my taste in films, grab this one.Warner Home Video has done yet another amazing job here. Oh, my God, how beautiful is this movie?!! The anamorphic transfer and Dolby Surround make it look and sound like it was filmed last week. The stark tragedy (cribbed from MADAME BOVARY) is set in gorgeous coastal Ireland during the 1916-21 Rebellion, with a truly impressive cast. Mitchum, Howard, Mills (who won an Oscar), McKern, and lovely Sarah Miles--all of them never better than they are here. Christopher Jones, though not in their league, is used to good effect. Freddie Young's Oscar-winning cinematography and Maurice Jarre's wistful score round out the package. The result is a work of great power and intelligence.The critics in 1970 trashed RYAN'S DAUGHTER for its old-fashioned technique and romanticism, and they dismissed it as \"Lean's Folly.\" Well, they were wrong. You've heard the expression, \"His biggest flop is better than everyone else's best effort.\" This film proves it. Nobody makes movies like this man. Nobody.

    "review/summary": "A Wonderful &amp; Absorbing Drama Set in Seaside Ireland!",
    "review/text": "No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British director who brought us such unforgettable classics as \"Lawrence of Arabia\", \"Bridge Over the River Kwai\", \"Doctor Zhivago\" and, of course, \"Ryan's Daughter\"(see my reviews of all these films). The cinematography in all of Lean's films is always spectacular and breathtaking, for Lean had a special appreciation for how the nature of one's natural surroundings set the stage and influenced the dramatic proceedings. Lean characteristically focused his films on the ways in which individuals and their personal characteristics clash and meld with the larger social, cultural, and historical surround in which they are located, and so each film is a uniquely captivating study of the specific dynamics of each particular individual situation. Each of these films is also a well-choreographed and photographed excursion into the topography, climate, and landscape of the geographic location in which the drama unfolds. The eyes and ears are always delighted by what Lean displays.Here both the Irish seascape as well as the bucolic countryside underpin this classic tale of how different life circumstances trap and constrain individuals, and how much each of us are affected by the greater social surround in which we interact. Robert Mitchum is cast against type, and does a marvelous job as an aging bachelor who has caught the fancy of a young and extraordinarily beautiful student who wants him to fulfill her youthful fantasies about all those adult characters he taught so ably about in class. Of course, the young woman, played ably by a young and gorgeous Sarah Miles, is bound for disappointment and a rude awakening. Things are not always as much like these literary descriptions as she had hoped.Into the picture comes an attractive, dashing, and daring young English soldier, played by Christopher Jones, who is immediately fatefully attracted to the young and foolish woman, and eventually an affair begins. All of this is set in the climate of both the Irish `troubles' and the threats associated with the ongoing First World War in Europe, in which Ireland is anxiously uninvolved. As in all of the Lean movies, the ways in which each character's nature, individual characteristics, and personal foibles project themselves into the larger social circumstances provides the focus of the unfolding story. While the plot is nowhere near as memorable as in some of Lean's other movies, the story is well told and is an interesting and compelling look at small town life in an isolated and provincial Irish village in the early years of the 20th century. I always enjoy watching it; any David Lean film is a lovely experience that is an enchanting way to while away a rainy Sunday afternoon. Enjoy!",

World War I is raging in Europe, but the villagers have their own war - against the British soldiers who are camped nearby. Teenage lovely, Rose Ryan (Sarah Miles), has a schoolgirl crush on her middle-aged teacher (Robert Mitchum) and dreams of becoming his wife. When they do marry, she is immediately dissatisfied and seeks passion in the arms of the enemy, English Major Doryan (Christopher Jones).Sarah Miles is perfect as the willful and conflicted young girl, and Mitchum, though an odd casting choice, is convincing as her kindly husband. Trevor Howard gives a wonderful performance as the town priest who knows everybody's business, and John Mills certainly deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar, playing a pitiful mute. Christopher Jones has the right look as the tortured, shell-shocked soldier, but his acting is wooden and even though he utters only a handful of words, his voice had to be dubbed by another actor.The rough and wild coast is beautifully photographed in the director's sweeping style, and Maurice Jarre's soundtrack is haunting. I was enchanted by this movie when it first came out, and still find it a lovely, sensual, and impressive film.Kona",

    "review/text": "...including the Amazon.com critic. I daresay that Ryan's Daughter is David Lean's greatest movie - yes, even better than Dr. Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia. Unlike the critics who lambasted the \"miscasting\" of the actors, I say that Sarah Miles (the younger adulteress) and John Mills (the village idiot) - both of whom earned Oscar nominations, with Mills winning his outright - were perfect for their roles, as were performances by Trevor Howard (the in-your-face yet wise priest), Leon McKern (the blustery yet traitorous father/publican), and Christopher Jones (the war-torn and lonely British Major). Even American Robert Mitchum played a believable duped, middle-aged husband - Irish accent and all. But no, the critics were quick to dump on Mitchum for taking a part outside his typical tough-guy role. It was like the critics expected him to beat the tar out of the British Major in the end (I guess then they would have been satisfied.) But Mitchum did something that the critics failed to see before - the man acted his role perfectly.Overall, the plot is tight for a three-hour-plus long movie and each scene adds to the overall plot. The amazing thing about this script is that you can't help to root (and feel sorry) for the adulteress, her soldier lover, her husband, the priest, the Irish rebels, the British soldiers, even the village idiot. The only people you hate outright are the narrow-minded, hateful, lazy villagers. You even feel sorry for the publican who finds himself in an impossible position as he betrays first the rebels and then his own daughter.Outstanding acting aside, the cinematography of Ryan's Daughter is incredible. You cannot help but be amazed at the beauty and grandeur of the coastline of Western Ireland. The storm scene where Irish rebels and the villages pluck German weapons and explosives off the sea-ravished rocks is unparalleled in movie history. (And this is before digital creation). I wonder how long Lean waited for such a storm to appear and then direct the actors/stuntmen in accordance with the dictates of the storm?Like all Lean directed movies, he uses sweeping vistas to show the immensity of space. He illustrates the pull of adultery with natural scenic symbolism as the lust-struck couple seeks privacy for their coupling. How many directors even bother nowadays with photographic symbolism? Not many considering the audiences of today who go to movies to react rather than to think.Ryan's Daughter is a perfect tale of betrayal, lust, love, and beauty - elements all found in other Lean movies, but perfected to artform in this epic.David Lean created his masterpiece in Ryan's Daughter...too bad only a few really see his genius here. The critics are fools.",

    "review/text": "Director David Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt are the same team that brought us Lawrence of Arabia and Dr. Zhivago, so expectations prior to the release of this film must have been sky-high. That being the case, I can understand why this film was panned by critics in 1970. The pace is glacial. At times, the film is so slow it seems to be going backward. The film clocks in at 3 hours, 20 minutes, but the story could easily been told in under 2 hours, without sacrificing a single pertinent detail. Easily.That being said, there are some wonderful performances here. John Mills, who plays Michael, the village idiot, won an Oscar for his outstanding performance. But the strongest performance was Trevor Howard's. Howard plays the village priest, heroically trying to exert an uplifting influence on his parishoners, most of whom are barely smarter than Michael, and much more savage. Robert Mitchum is cast very much against type; in most roles, he exudes casual but strong virility, yet in this role he is called upon to play a milquetoast aesthete who cannot sexually satisfy his young wife. And he does an excellent job, nailing the Irish accent, to boot.The real star of the movie, however, is the beautiful west coast of Ireland, lovingly photographed. This DVD looks absolutely gorgeous in an anamorphic widescreen 2-disk transfer. The scenery alone is well worth the price of this DVD, even if you ignore the bloated, melodramatic plot.",

I can't help but wonder if it is not on DVD because there are people who do not want this film to be widely available. As it is now, you have to dig for it. If more people watched this film they might be asking questions our \"leaders\" would rather have left unasked. If you have not seen this film, or it has been a number of years since you saw it last, I can recommend it. It is not an overt anti-war film with an explicit anti-war message, but after seeing it, you will not view world events with the same eyes you did before, I promise.",

John Mills (Haley's Daddy) deserved his Supporting Actor Oscar for his touching portrayal of Michael, the \"Village Idiot\" who displays more sense than most of the village. Mitchum plays well against type as the cuckolded village schoolmaster, and Trevor Howard `tis grand as the priest pressed to preside over the whole mess of it.This reviewer was disappointed in the \"Two-Disc Special Edition\" as the \"specials\" are not very special at all, at all. The commentary by the Widow Lean, Sarah Miles, Mitchum's Daughter et. al is a Mutual Admiration Society of fawning, saccharinly self-laudatory blather of mostly biographical fluff and is a missed opportunity to dispel American popular misconceptions about \"the Troubles\" as merely a matter of differences in religious theology. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer",

The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste.

Rose's love scenes with the English soldier did nothing to make the viewer believe this was a passionate love that could not be denied. In fact, they didn't appear much different than her love scene with Robert Mitchum. There was nothing about either Rose or the English soldier that would indicate irresistability. Perhaps each was particulary attracted to woodenness.While it was a good looking film in terms of scenery and mood, the story was rather ridiculous with many, many holes. We are expected to believe that Rose and the English soldier had an incredibly close relationship, yet he hardly speaks to her. I suppose the viewer must assume that the relationship was more developed than it appeared in the scenes they had together. Why did the soldier commit suicide? Because of the mess he had made of Rose's life? Because of his apparent post-traumatic stress disorder? Because he couldn't have Rose (for reasons, by the way, never made clear. She expected to part with her husband, so why not?)Basically, I found the love story unconvincing and the acting bad. From a technical point of view, the DVD was disappointing in that the sound is terrible - very muffled which, together with the by and large fake Irish brogues, made the dialogue difficult to understand.

    "review/text": "I've always been a very big David Lean fan. I think of him as the master of the epic. I enjoyed his early collaborations with Noel Coward and such films as \"Brief Encounter\" and \"In Which We Serve\" and I've also enjoyed his more celebrated titles; \"Doctor Zhivago\", \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and \"Bridge on the River Kwai\". But \"Ryan's Daughter\" is a mixed bag. Perhaps die-hard Lean fans will sing its praises but I want to remain unbiase. This is really a lesser effort from the great director.Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles in an Oscar nominated role) wants more out of life after getting married to a man she claims to love, Charles Shaughnessy (Robert Mitchum) but does not know what. The town's priest, Father Collins (Trevor Howard) tells her besides the love of a good man, her health, and money there is nothing more to ask for in life. But Rosy won't hear of such nonsense! She knows that there must be something more to life than what she has.Charles is a schoolteacher who's wife has passed away. And at first did not want to get involved with Rosy. He is after all twice her age. He figured Rosy would end up with a man her own age but no. It was Rosy who went after him.The film takes place during the early 1900s as the beginnings of WW1 linger in the air. But here's where the fault on the film lies. In the first 40-45 minutes of the movie it's hard not to pay attention to all the long shots Lean uses as we get shots of characters walking alongside the beach, we see mountains and beautiful landscapes. My objection to all of this is for what purpose is it done? It seems Lean wants to impress us with background more than the story. In his other works, say \"Doctor Zhivago\" I never felt the background was a distraction, here though Lean seems to want to give the film that big epic feel but it doesn't work.The reason of this may very well be the content of the story. The movie is about a love affair Rosy has with a British officer, (Christopher Jones) after her marriage to Charles and the stir it causes within the town. This story is not strong enough to go on for 4 hours. Lean makes the mistake of not injecting enough of the historical setting to the film. He seems to interested in the landscape setting to pay attention to anything else.While most of the performances are quite good I found I grew to dislike Michael (John Mills), the town's simpleton. What is his purpose in the film? He only gives the film a certain level of comic relief, but it's not needed. And what about the way the town treats him? It almost downright brutal. But his presence just came to annoy me. How odd than to find he won the Academy Award that year for Best Supporting Actor. But honestly what does the Academy know? I don't even bother to watch them anymore.Still despite these imperfections \"Ryan's Daughter\" managed to hold my attention. The performances by Mitchum and Howard are entertaining even though the movie never really give us the opportunity to know these people. We never really know what exactly happened to Randolph Doryan, the young British soldier. We never really know why Rosy is attracted to him. We never really know why Charles married her in the first place. But I still think many should see this movie. I find it funny so many people think of \"Doctor Zhivago\" as a lesser film. That movie is a masterpiece one of the greatest epic romances of all time. It's \"Ryan's Daughter\" that is the lesser film.Bottom-line: Entertaining yet somehow disappointing David Lean film. The movie seems to try to hard to impress us with its landscape but doesn't make much use of the historical setting.

This original work shows that he may have overdone it. An adulterous love affair with a dashing British officer in Ireland during WWI is the core of this film, similar to what we saw in &quot;Zhivago&quot;. The rugged coastline and its people reflect what we saw in &quot;Lawrence&quot;. However the photography is simply gorgeous and ravishingingly beautiful. The best performance is no doubt Sir John Mills as the village dummy who can't speak but understands the human events that swirl around him without reason, deservedly winning him an Oscar for this film, as did the photography. Attractive and appealing, but not of the same heights or nature as with Lean's earlier creations. Novel adaptations seem to work better in his favor.",

    "review/text": "Often regarded as the masterful David Lean's \"least great\" film, this story of rural southwestern Ireland during the First World War is still an extremely beautiful exercise in film making. One of only two films in the last third of the twentieth century to be shot in 65 mm, a sort of cinematic precursor of today's high definition, Lean was on record in later years as saying this was the film he was both proudest of and also most frustrated by.Concentrating more on its stark but lush physical setting than its characters (sometimes focusing on setting to the detriment of its characters) Ryan's Daughter is a story about one Rosy Ryan, the pampered, pretty young daughter of a famous town publican, Tom Ryan, who marries a kindly but much older schoolmaster, Charles Shaughnessy, and soon comes to regret that she has. Bored with her limited wedded life, spoiled, always wishing for things she cannot have, the pretentious Rosy becomes infatuated with a melancholy young British military officer who has been sent to her desolate corner of Ireland after returning home from France wounded in the leg. The townspeople in the area are an aggressively closed-minded and xenophobic lot, virulently anti-British and pro-Republican, and Rosy, fool though she sometimes seems, is aware of what her fate would be should her involvement with the tragic-natured Englishman be revealed. What Rosy is unaware of is that her celebrated father, the town's leading man, is also a double agent who feeds information on Republican activities back to the British. A risky practice to say the least.Through it all the little town is kept under control by Father Collins, a stern presence in the community, feared, respected, deferred to by old and young. The phlegmatic Collins tries to direct Ryan's wayward daughter to be sensible in her life, but Rosy seems impelled toward behavior that can only bring ruin onto herself and those connected to her. Her recklessness makes Rosy far less a sympathetic person than an annoying one. She clearly and repeatedly places herself above others and accepts others' hardships as a small price for her own comfort. Her moment of possible redemption late in the film opens the door to hope for her, but the impression is that this is but a brief aberration in a deep-set egotism that is probably unshakable.This movie is famous for its scene filmed on a beach during an actual raging Atlantic gale, and even from the comfort of home to see multi-story waves break over and over amid furious winds makes you appreciate the commitment that went into making Ryan's Daughter what it was. All in all, however, Ryan's Daughter is not a great film. There is a paucity to its plot that deters its inclusion among the upper ranks of Lean's greatest works, and deep down the characters here breed their own destructions in ways that makes one feel their fates were warranted. The beauty of Ryan's Daughter is strictly visual rather than contemplative, and the truly best films of all time are those that brim with both.Four stars, but well worth seeing.",

It is a long movie, but the story flows and it brings Ireland to life in a way not seen since \"The Quiet Man\".Cinematography and music are as usual the best you can find. And the actors, severely criticized over the years make some of their best performances. Including Robert Mitchum believed by many to be miscast for the part. John Mills portrayal of the village idiot rightly brought him and Academy Award. And if we don't compare Sarah Miles to Julie Christie she stands on her own.Let David Lean take your hand and take you to Ireland; you will be glad you did.",

    "review/text": "\"Ryan's Daughter\" was a unique David Lean offering, for it had no story prior to its original screenplay. It does offer something that is quite different. It is an epic that is really very small in scope. Set against the Irish/British turbulence that exists even into today, the film tells the story of a very young woman who marries the wrong man (a schoolteacher played by Robert Mitchum, who lacks any real sexual awareness) and then falls in love with the wrong man (A British Sergeant who is stationed in her home town). Ultimately she is found out and disgraced and she has no choice but to leave town. Her father is an informer in the film, and John Mills (in an Oscar-winning performance) plays a mute, crippled human being who catches on all too soon to what Ryan's daughter is up to. Sarah Miles deservedly received an Oscar nomination for her performance. She is sensuous, young, forthright, fragile and ultimately heart-wrenching in her final scenes. Robert Mitchum surprises in a very low-keyed role as her husband, and Christopher Jones is very fine as the soldier who has seen too much of war's devastation. We witness it several times throughout the film. Maurice Jarre's music is sensuos and then militaristic -- and all highly original. Lean's palette is as beautiful as ever. It is a long film, but one that I intend to re-view several times for its subtleties. And just where is the DVD, MGM? I hope they intend to release it.",

    "review/text": "For many, it would be easy to overlook this film by David Lean. The film, as well as Mr. Lean, was thoroughly roasted by the critics upon its release as being self-indulgent and boring; a claim that still colors its reputation some 35 years later. Its running time is over 3 hours (with an intermission) and its pacing can easily be dismissed as tedious for those addicted to today's more hyper-speed level of storytelling. But it is a beautifully told, magical film, that slowly lingers and draws in its viewer, delivering an incredible evening's fare. Though it does not rise to the level of Lean's masterpiece, \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" it certainly offers many brilliantly directed moments and breathtaking photography, making it a \"must see\" for any film lover.Warner Bros., after an incredibly long wait, has released a beautiful and appropriate DVD release for this classic film. The film looks incredible!! Really, it just looks awesome! The colors are pristine, the print is crystal clear and free from age. I could not believe how stunning the picture looks. The film is spread over 2 discs, offering the optimum bit rate to ensure a top-notch transfer. The sound has been remixed to Dolby Digital 5.1 and, though it is far from reference quality, supports the film very well. (However, on my system, the music sounded incredibly flat. Particularly the Overture.)There is a bounty of extras that include a thoroughly engaging and informative audio commentary from a wide-range of participants. The commentaries have been perfectly edited together to form a cohesive narrative that runs throughout the picture. Very well done. The additional DVD-specific documentary is of the traditional fare (helmed by the DVD extras master himself, Laurent Bouzereau), offering rare interviews with David Lean and writer, Robert Bolt, as well as recent interviews with many of the film's production crew, recent Lean biographers, and others. Plenty of good stuff to go around.All-in-all this is an outstanding DVD release for one of Lean's most under-appreciated works. If you haven't seen it, get this DVD. If you have seen it, get this DVD, it will be a welcomed addition to your collection.",

    "review/text": "Another curate's egg from Lean, but redeemed by one of Robert Mitchum's greatest ever performances, bravely cast against type as the gentle Irish schoolteacher who becomes the village joke when his young wife takes up with a shell-shocked British officer. Ignored at the time for the showier attractions of Mills' village idiot (a role Norman Wisdom desperately wanted), it's a remarkably intelligent and subtly observed character study that holds far more appeal than Sarah Miles' title role. As always, Lean reserves the real talent (Mills, Trevor Howard, Leo McKern) for the sidelines and comes up with one of his blandest leads in the shape of Peter O'Toole lookalike and future down-and-out Jones while the force of history is reduced to background for a simple love story.Maurice Jarre's score is something of a liability, but overall this is still the best of the director's post-Lawrence films and certainly not fully deserving of the critical slating that led to his 17-year absence from the screen. There is still a very real sense of the cinematic, with both colour and the widescreen ratio exploited to the full, something the increasingly TV-conscious director refused to even attempt with the surprisingly poor A Passage to India.Although much impact is lost in the step down from 70mm to TV screen - particularly during the vivid storm sequence - the widescreen DVD makes it seem like a different and much better film if you've only ever seen it panned-and-scanned before. With some excellent extras, it's a fine presentation.",

David Lean makes all the characters very real. What a powerful figure John Mills played as the village idiot. Father Collins plays a country priest in this village along the west coast of Ireland, but he has tremendous knowing of the people and of life in general. Rosy Shaughnessey is the young dreamer who falls in love with the dashing young British officer, and Rosy's husband, Charles who is much older than Rosy kindly keeps in the background, hoping the romance will die a natural death. Some of the village characters are utterly vicious, and you are made to feel an intense dislike for them.The political situation between England and Ireland is clearly defined throughout the movie.",

    "review/text": "No one would argue that David Lean wasn't an exceptionally talented director. For Ryan's Daughter he assembled a talented cast and beautiful location (Ireland) to paint the picture of two lovers torn asunder by social and political forces. Unfortunately, unlike Dr. Zvivago which was a critical and commercial success, Ryan's Daughter was unable to match the intensity or impact of Lean's other films.The fault lies mostly in the direction by Lean - this film would have been served by another pass in the editing room to tighten up and shorten some of the scenes and in the case of the two lovers, slow it down a bit to allow the audience to buy into their intense attraction for each other. I have read that the talented actor who plays Rosy's love interest (Christopher Jones as Major Doryan) was faulted for providing a flat performance - after watching this movie, it is obvious to me he (Christopher Jones) was scapegoated for the lack of more cohesive directing and editing. Jones hit exactly the right note in portraying the Major as a tragic character - shell schocked from his time at the front and both physically and spiritually a broken man. There are two seminal scenes in the film where the Major is stricken by his panic attack flashback to the fronts - these are beautifully and subtley played by Jones - watching him struggle to control himself and beat back the panic it is hard not to feel compassion for him. The character Rosy, played by Sarah Miles, is also hurt by jumps in the story - the scene in the village bar where she meets the Major is rushed and not believable even by today's standards for attraction. Lean would have been better served he he allowed the characters some time to develop a rapport versus exploding into an immediate attraction which seems unlikely based on the social mores of the time and the circumstances of their meeting. I think that Lean himself wasn't sure how to portray their instant attraction so the next time we see the lovers is in a long, drawn out, strange scene of them riding through the forest looking for a place to have a lover's tryst. The scene is akward, slow moving and does nothing to help the audience invest emotionally with them.While it is a flawed film - I rate it 4 starts due to the the acting which is superb, some beautiful camera work and a haunting and memorable score. Sadly, Christopher Jones the young actor who played Major Doryan gave up movies after making this movie and Lean himself didn't make another movie for 14 years. Yes worth a watch but expect some long scenes where you might want to use the remote to speed up a bit and do the editing that Lean and his crew should have done before the movie released!",

Be patient with his leisurely pacing; allow the windswept, desolate landscape and magical lighting to work its enchantment.It's a tone poem, you see.One of the opening titles proudly announces, \"Photographed in Super Panavision on the west coast of Ireland.\" What director nowadays cares enough to demand the finest image quality possible? Who has the clout to insist on months of expensive location shooting, when digital \"money shots\" are only a point and click away? Not even Steven Spielberg, the most powerful director in Hollywood, has ever made a genuine 70mm epic! RYAN'S DAUGHTER represents the end of a grand tradition: Movies in which the natural grandeur of the settings, and the vastness and clarity of the presentation, were important reasons for seeing the film.And the DVD really delivers. The anamorphic picture, made from the original 65mm negative, looks as if it was filmed yesterday. Not a scratch or speck of dust are visible. The image is sharp as a tack, and the colors are beautifully graded, with a wide tonal range and no digital artifacts. Visually, this is a reference quality disc.The sound isn't bad for the period. The stereo image is broad and clean, but rather flat. This is a good one for headphones. Too bad there's no way to turn off Jarre's idiotic music. Imagine if Clannad, or some other traditional Irish band, had written the score instead!Aside from Mitchum, who cannot be blamed, the cast is very fine. Even the minor roles are unusually well handled. Miles is heartbreakingly beautiful. The sex scenes are surprisingly erotic but unfailingly tasteful. The story has a fateful Irish edge; by the intermission, you know you're in for downward spiral of unremitting tragedy.No, RYAN'S DAUGHTER is not as fine as LAWRENCE or ZHIVAGO or even A PASSAGE TO INDIA, but it's still very good indeed, and very beautiful. Well worth setting aside a rainy evening.",

    "review/summary": "Not your typical epic chick flick",
    "review/text": "Most would probably consider this a 70s chick flick, but it is far superior to that genre. These are characters imbued with all the frailties of real people. Sarah Miles had a brief run in the 70s on the A list of female British stars. Though I was never a huge fan (she always projected a very fragile and neurotic vibe), she is perfect for the role of Rose, the refined, romance obsessed, spoiled daughter of the local pub keeper in a small village on the Western coast of Ireland. Her older cuckolded husband, the local grammar school teacher, is played to perfection and against type by Robert Mitchum. A man who loves her so deeply he cannot even bring himself to confront her regarding her affair with the handsome, young English officer who has been snatched from the front lines and assigned to this godforsaken outpost due to a bad case of post traumatic stress from WWI. The movie was unfairly panned when it was released. Although it may not suit the audiences of today who need gory slam bam action scenes in every frame to hold their attention, for those who enjoy a beautifully photographed landscape, and intense character development, along with grade A acting, this film will satisfy. The characters display the whole gamut of emotions and behaviors, noble and depraved, of which humans are capable. Robert Bolt's screenplay is to be credited greatly with the success of this film. Some of the scenes between the characters are so touching and heartbreakingly authentic that it is easy to forget these are not real people. The one disappointment for me: though I have been a big fan of much of Maurice Jarre's film scores, this was not one that lived up to the subject. I found the music for the most part trivial and uninspiring, especially when it is contrasted with the exotic and breathtakingly beautiful locale. (If you haven't visited this part of the world, you will definitely want to after seeing this film). Another reviewer suggested that maybe American audiences didn't really get this film due to a lack of understanding of the Irish/English animosity. There is probably a lot of truth to that. I don't believe the repression of the Irish has ever been taught to any meaningful degree in American education, and one must self-educate on that topic. A good film to start with on that topic would be the \"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\".",

    "review/text": "The progress of David Lean's visual style is one of honest, thrilling emotion subsumed over the years by unnecessary, rote effect--an artistic hardening-of-the-arteries not entirely unlike the bloat of Wordsworth's later work.Of his pictures which history will remember well, Lean delivered at least one masterpiece (&quot;Oliver Twist,&quot; 1948), which dared to risk anachronism when it evoked the prison camps of WWII in its workhouse boys' scabby, balding heads--not to mention Alec Guinness's frightening Fagin (&quot;What right have you to butcher me!?&quot;).He made two other first-rate pictures: &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946), a rare triumph of literary abbreviation, &amp; &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957), the most melancholy meditation on suffering I've ever seen--like a paragraph from Dostoyevsky or Solzhenitsyn played deftly out to feature length.&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962) signalled, I think, the beginning of an elephantiasis in Lean's ambition--though it's been observed that &quot;Lawrence's&quot; minimalist compositions and love of &quot;empty&quot; screen-space may have primed audiences for later, more abstract adventures such as &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; and even &quot;Apocalypse Now.&quot;Lean's respectful eye for and fascination with natural landscapes, especially as they dwarf people, and the psychologic import of that domination of scale, was often on ostentatious and useful display in his early and middle years. Later, this titanic style of framing became expected of Lean--not least, repeated viewings attest, by the man himself. It's as if he became trapped by his repute for monumentality, which was rarely less appropriate than here.&quot;Ryan's Daughter,&quot; based on a parlor-scale melodrama by Robert Bolt, never has the chance to escape Lean's Olympian regard and withers on film like a bug caught in the projector gate. Never mind the performances, which are generally credible, nor the cinematography, which (in the only home video available, a wretched panned-&amp;-scanned dub with horrible color balance) is typically assured work from Freddie Young.&quot;Ryan's Daughter&quot; is a failure from a man with a fading vision, and uninstructive ... unless the lesson is to tailor style to substance at all costs.",

    "review/text": "I, like so many of its fans, cannot understand what was in the minds of critics at the time who bashed this film. No, it is certainly not Quiet Man, and thank God for that. The Ireland reflected in Ryan's Daughter is not your quaint, leprechan-filled stereotypical place beloved by the world that doesn't know much about the real Ireland. The atmosphere in this movie is haunting and disturbing and reflective of a great deal in Irish life, particularly at the time of the revolution against British rule. The attitudes of the narrow-minded villagers was realistic and in line with the church-dominated lives they led, and the Irish are great begrudgers so their jealousy of the lovely daughter of the local publican is quite believable. However, this story of a young woman married to a respectable and kindly older man but yearning for romantic love takes on a greater significance when it addresses the deeper issues involved: retribution, redemption, forgiveness, betrayal and loyalty. The love scenes between Sara Miles and Christopher Jones, playing the shell-shocked British soldier who arouses the desire she has kept under wraps, are some of the most intense and moving I've seen. When they become enmeshed in the village's suspicions, prejudices and hatred of the English, all set against the backdrop of the brooding and rather sinister Irish countryside, the tragedy is set in place. This is a riveting film filled with outstanding performances, beautiful scenery and universal themes. Robert Mitchum in particular is outstanding in what may have been his best ever performance, and one very much against type. And, of course, there is the ever-present star of the show, Ireland, the incredibly beautiful land of saints and scholars, informers and patriots, martyrs and conspirators. This is a film to add to your collection.",

    "review/summary": "Sweeping, Flawed Epic Sadly Maligned But Eminently Worthwhile for Lean's Cinematic Mastery",
    "review/text": "It's no surprise to me that David Lean's penultimate film, 1970's \"Ryan's Daughter\", is the last of his epic films to receive the deluxe DVD treatment since it is likely the most maligned and misunderstood. However, the 2006 two-disc package really shows a genuinely affecting, WWI-era romantic melodrama set against the stormy western coast of Ireland. Calling it a sweeping epic does not really do justice to the splendid visuals that Lean and his favorite cameraman Freddie Young present here (Ireland's Dingle peninsula looks stunning), yet at its core is an intimate love triangle that raises the ire of the village given the political frictions between Britain and Ireland. It seems a shame that the film was so lambasted when it was released since expectations were set so high after Lean's previous three films, all three widescreen masterworks - 1957's \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", 1962's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and 1965's \"Doctor Zhivago\".Written by Robert Bolt (who also wrote \"Lawrence\" and \"Zhivago\") as a Celtic variation on Flaubert's \"Madame Bovary\", the plot is focused on Rosy, the spoiled, headstrong daughter of Thomas Ryan, the local publican. She seeks a more cultured life and sets her sights on Charles Shaughnessy, the educated schoolmaster. Rosy makes the naive presumption that Charles' worldliness represents great passion but finds out otherwise on their wedding night. Enter Major Randolph Doryan, the young, shell-shocked British soldier assigned to take command of the local army detachment. Doryan and Rosy enter into a passionate affair, but it's a matter of time before Charles and the rest of the village find out. Meanwhile, a band of Irish rebels led by Tim O'Leary are intent on retrieving a shipment of German arms in order to take umbrage against the unwelcome British occupiers. The two plot strands merge, and tragic consequences ensue.There are certainly moments of excessive, florid abandon in the film, especially when Lean focuses on the illicit lovers. The director goes all out in making the lovemaking scenes between Rosy and Doryan combustible, first in the pub amid Doryan's traumatic flashbacks of exploding bombs and then in a lengthy and surprisingly carnal scene in a wooded enclave. Their mutual rapture is at turns moving and titillating. The other drawback is that unlike \"Zhivago\" or \"Lawrence\", Lean does not really integrate the political backdrop of the story fully into the triangle plot. Rather, he uses it more as a plot device to give the story a greater historical resonance. At the same time, some sequences highlight Lean's brilliance as a film auteur, for example, when Charles gradually discovers the reality of his wife's indiscretion on the beach or the aftermath of the town pillaging when Rosy is brutalized for her alleged role in helping the British. From a technical standpoint, Lean's pure cinematic mastery can be best seen in the storm sequence, when the town bands together to get the boxes of artillery. Maurice Jarre's music is memorable, as his haunting theme plays constantly throughout.The performances are variable, though all the key players provide strong moments. Sarah Miles handles the difficult role of Rosy with dexterity, especially as she runs the risk of alienating the viewer with her extramarital deception. In what has to be the most atypical role of his lengthy career, Robert Mitchum is a revelation as Charles. His natural tough-guy veneer has been completely subverted to play a passive, accepting man whose love for Rosy remains unsullied by the harsh reality of her adulterous behavior. It's a masterful performance because with a minimum of fuss, Mitchum taps into the depth of despair experienced by the cuckold husband. Looking pained and obviously cast for his James Dean-like demeanor and look, Christopher Jones portrays Doryan with brooding stares and a minimum of dialogue. Lean does what he can to camouflage Jones' comparatively stoic performance, but the result still provides a sagging imbalance to the love triangle. A heavily made up John Mills plays the mute gargoyle-like Michael as a series of tics and befuddled looks. Leo McKern effectively plays Ryan for the weak-willed hypocrite that his character is, and his emotional abandonment of his daughter is quite affecting. As Father Collins, Trevor Howard has a wild-eyed look about him at times, but he passionately provides the moral compass for the story.As the movie runs for three hours and fifteen minutes (actually shorter than \"Lawrence\" and the same as \"Zhivago\"), the film is spread across two discs separated by an intermission. In fact, like any epic, there is orchestral music for the overture, intermission (which ends part 1), entr'acte (which begins part 2) and ending. The print quality is superior and the sound even better. The commentary track has several participants who take turns commenting on the scenes. DVD producer Laurent Bouzereau smartly introduces each speaker in order to avoid confusion, and the differing perspectives can be quite interesting. Disc 2 has a solid, hour-long 2006 documentary, \"The Making of Ryan's Daughter\" divided into three chapters, as well as a couple of production shorts made at the time of filming.",

    "review/text": "I am happy \"Ryan's Daughter\" is coming out on DVD (finally!) and I agree with the other reviewers that it is one of Lean's masterpiece's of epic scope. But so far, all the accolades have been saved for \"Kwai,\" \"Lawrence\" (above all), and \"Zhivago.\" Much less is said about \"A Passage to India,\" Master (Sir) Lean's consummate masterpiece, based on the E.M.Forster novel, perhaps because he made his own version of the story (changing beginning and ending). It is a movie where even the most minute character is developed, and a message for humanity (\"only connect\"), in ascending scale, is given in compelling dramatic fashion. I saw \"Ryan's Daughter\" when it came out in the big screen, and it is a dazzling romantic tragedy, fabulously photographed, and brilliantly acted. Can't wait to own the DVD and treasure it as I have all the other epics, five in all--the only epics, as a whole, that elevate the much-worn format in the 20th century. MY admiration increases every time I watch it, saying to myself what were those \"high-brow\" critics at the Algonquin Hotel, in New York, in 1970, thinking when the movie came out, making outrageous comments that the sensitive Lean took to heart and stayed away from moviemaking for fourteen year? Thanks to this edition, and the upcoming blu-ray, people at last can see it in all its magnificence. Encouraging to see all these comments from new and old viewers who feel as I do, and perhaps even higher, about this movie--which becomes better with time. Note on 9/20/2012: I have seen the DVD, many times, analyzed it, and written about it in great detail. My opinion of the movie stands, and I am happy to see that many reviewers before and after it have given it high marks. The admittedly slow-paced movie combines a perfectly structured plot, charactizations, expecially from the likes of Leo McKern, John Mills, who, as know, won an Oscar for his role as the mute lover of Rosie Ryan, Trevor Howard, who was nominated for an Oscar, and just about everyone in the village crowd. Despite his brawls with Lean, Robert Mitchum, playing against character, managed an almost perfect performance, first as the sexually limp husband, then rising to a giant on the screen in the final exit from the village mob; and even Christopher Jones has a stunning visual presence, though I wish they had allowed him to speak in his own voice, rather than in dubbed monosyllables. Sarah Miles could not have been more expressive of a woman wrapped in fantasy and then having a cruel awakening, after betraying both husband and lover. An intimate epic, with classic tragic contours, but also one of genuine spectacle in the storm sequences, unequalled since then, since no computer generated images can duplicate an actual filming of a natural event of such magnitude. This film offers many pleasures to the the cineaste, whether a university professor or \"man on the street,\" as Lean used to say. Add the vast landscape of western Ireland photographed by award-winning Freddie Young, and you have a stunning epic of drama, adventure, and a delicately woven plot. Modelled on Madame Bovary, by Flaubert, this is a woman's story, but no less that of a man, or men plus a crowd, maddened to a rage knowing this woman, Ryan's \"princess\" daughter, dared to dream of a flight to a world of freedom and romance, but paying for her dream at the end. Again, try the movie, if you want to taste this condemned (by some) masterpiece by David Lean.",

I wanted Sarah Miles to have her passionate love, but then again, I didn't want her good husband (Mitchum) to lose her, I wanted the British officer (Jones) not to be tortured and haunted, and I didn't want anyone hurting the lovable village idiot. (John Mills deserved the Oscar he got for this role!) The relationship between John Mills' and Sarah Miles' characters broke my heart. And I hated, hated with a capital H some of the others (I won't say who and spoil it for anyone). This is all to say that I was pretty much transfixed and transported by this movie from start to finish. And if there's any scene in any movie from the beginning of time that's more erotic than the one in her father's pub when Sarah Miles' character first meets the British lieutenant, I hope someone warns me; I don't think I could withstand it. I love my video of the movie, but I wish I could see it again on the big screen for the impact of the magnificent cinematography of the Irish coast. And of the pub.",

There are moments of pure cinema in this film. Savor the jump to a lingering introductory shot of Rose Ryan's semi-fantasy British army officer, standing quietly in the middle distance on a remote country lane. This comes immediately after a noisy and energetic close-up of Father Collins, on a beach, warning Rose that she might get what she wishes for. Best of all, for me, is the imagery conjured up later by Rose's increasingly suspicious husband, Charles Shaughnessy. He imagines himself silently watching Rose and her soldier strolling together in a scene of intense romance that he knows he himself could never provide for his wife. We watch Charles, on the screen, watching a vision of his own private fears and longings. Be sure to catch this wonderful, beautiful film.",

    "review/text": "\"Ryan's Daughter\" is one of the finest films in cinema history. It is the third and best of the great trilogy of films made by David Lean (director) Robert Bolt (screenwriter) and Maurice Jarre (music). The first two were \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and \"Doctor Zhivago\". The film is visually and emotionally as powerful as the wild scenery and weather of Ireland's west coast which feature so prominently. The story of a young woman's struggle to find something special in life, and her ostracism from her close knit community, set amidst the historical turmoil of the Irish rebellion of 1916, is utterly compelling. The performances of this glittering cast are breathtaking. John Mills (Michael - the village idiot) received a richly-deserved Academy Award for his role - in which he at no stage utters a word. Trevor Howard as the village priest contributes his finest ever performance. Leo McKern as Ryan plays a role with flamboyance and emotional complexity. Robert Mitchum as the cuckolded husband is brave, understated and exactly right. Sarah Miles, in the lead role, plays a character who is transformed by the experiences she undergoes. The film received poor critical reviews at the time of its release (from the same reviewers who had praised \"Lawrence\" and \"Zhivago\"), although it did reasonably well at the box office. It is as if the reviewers didn't want David Lean to become too big a figure in the film world. Robert Bolt (his other credits include \"A Man for All Seasons\" and \"The Mission\") demonstrates his talent as a screenwriter of powerful drama with this masterpiece. \"Ryan's Daughter\" is a wonderful story, beautifully told. It is all that a great film should be.",

There arn't many good young men around so she has her sights set on an older, single, male schoolteacher, played by Robert Mitchum. Well, after a fanciful marriage and still a virgin, Rose discovers that the teacher isn't such a hot lover, which leaves Rose a bit disappointed.\"There must be more.\" She tells her priest, played by Trevor Howard.\"Be careful what you ask for Rose.\" he tells her, \"Because as sure as hell you'll get it.\"And then the movie starts.When this film first came out, I was so spellbound by it that I went to the cinema to see it repeatedly, unlike any other movie. I became totally absorbed in the sheer epic of such a simple love story: the photography, the sensitivity, the location and the characters. Why couldn't other film-makers tell a story with such grace, style and sensuality? Well, I found out that other film-makers didn't have the big budgets that Director David Lean had. So I wonder, could David Lean have made a film on a small budget? Thank God he didn't. We have been left such a rich legacy of fine films from this master craftsman.Critique Pauline Kael panned Ryan's Daughter so badly when it first came out and David Lean took it so hard and personally, that he didn't make another film for fourteen years. Perhaps Ms Kael wasn't sensitive but Mr. Lean's sensitivity shows through more in this film than with most others he's made. Thank you for your artistry Mr. Lean.Recently, while on a trip to Western Ireland I made a pilgrimage to the end of the Dingle Peninsula where they filmed Ryan's Daughter. Unbelievably the schoolhouse is still standing where they built it for the movie in 1969, in a farmer's field, on the hillside overlooking the sea. And it's still in good shape, as if the film crew had left it standing yesterday.",

Here he is in an unusually low-key role as the long-suffering husband of fornicator Sarah Miles. He never overplays it and certainly got my sympathy. Trevor Howard is equally impressive as the local priest, and John Mills turns in a good performance as the village idiot, managing to evoke the right amount of pathos at the appropriate moments. On top of a great cast, there's a wonderful score by Maurice Jarre and beautiful location filming on the West coast of Ireland. Excellently directed and photographed (by recent Oscar-winner Freddie Young), this is an all-round entertaining movie, which manages to retain its grip till the end.",

Fabulous scenery though some of the shots, taken out of necessity on a South African beach, show water a bit too blue to be Ireland.

    "review/text": "If you appreciate the oppression and abuse of the Irish by the British occupation,\"The Troubles\", you will better understand this movie. In 1970 I loved this movie for the beautiful landscape, western Ireland with a focus on the Dingle Pennisula, and the performance of Robert Mitchum who deserved an academy award or at least a nomination. But with my present fair knowledge of the historical resistance to the British rule in Ireland I appreciate the details and better understand the plot of \"Ryan's Daugther.\" Rosy Ryan, played by Sarah Miles, is a rather spoiled young woman and daughter of the fairly affluent local pub owner, played wonderfully by Leo McKern. She decides she wants more from life and seeks and subsequently convinces Charles the village teacher (Robert Mitchum)to marry her. With the knowledge of the intense opposition of the Irish toward British occupation it is understandable how the village people turn against their own when she develops an emotional and sexual relationship with a young British officer (played by Christopher Jones). The central plot is love of person, Rosy for the British officer, Charles for Rosy, Ryan for his daughter, and the Irish for their country. The secondary plot is betrayal of person and of country (I leave these betrayls for you to see in the movie).The village mute idiot, played by John Miles (who received an academy award for supporting actor) ties all the people and events together with his naive actions. This is a great film which is relevant today as the news announces another potential for the British to withdraw its rule from Ireland. Don't hold you breath. Although the actions or the present Irish people seem less intense than in 1916 the setting for this movie, their feelings may not be. They want the Brits out of Ireland. But the British remain with one excuse after another. See this movie and I hope you will better understand as I did of the conflict \"The Troubles\" that the Irish have with British rule.The two disc set enhances the information behind the film and is worth the extra price.",

I had to laugh though when I learned that some of the movie was filmed in another country (beach scenes), but all in all it was a good movie. My husband said it was more like a 'chick flick' because the husband didn't really put a stop to his wife's infidelities - it was a little too romantic for his taste. At least when we go to that part of the country and someone asks if we've seen the movie - I can say, \"Yes, I did!\" I would still recommend this movie to those who like romance movies and period pieces.",

    "review/text": "This afternoon I watched my home-recorded 6 hour VHS of A&E;'s 25th anniversary special, JFK ASSASSINATION: AS IT HAPPENED and was curious if there were any official releases of this NBC-TV broadcast. Whether this one's a bootleg, I can't speculate.Some time around 2 pm EST, the network broke into regular programming with a bulletin that shots had been fired in Dallas. Eleven minutes later, someone started rolling tape. As we see, Bill Ryan, at screen right, acted as unofficial anchor of the afternoon's impromptu coverage. He, Chet Huntley and Frank McGee were possibly set up in a wood panelled conference room. The first hour of coverage was utter chaos. Remotes from Dallas failed, as did the audio system tapped into a phone line. McGee had to repeat the words of an unheard Bob McNeill, who was on-the-spot at Parkland Memorial, while technicians worked on getting an audio patch.Huntley handed him a primitive listening device at one point. Frank fumbled with it, got it on the earpiece of the phone, but then leaned in too close to a desk mike, which caused a squealing feedback that drowned out McNeill. He went back to repeating the reporter's phrases. Later when phone audio was working, Frank continued to parrot McNeill, changing an occasional word. At this time, Huntley, who sat between McGee and Ryan, departed, and coverage became two-man.Bill Ryan remained as optimistic as possible in the face of ever more dire reports. Calls for a priest didn't mean death is imminent, he said, and one for a neurosurgeon could simply indicate a spinal cord injury. This positive pretense was dropped with a first unconfirmed report from two priests that JFK was dead. Official word soon followed.Throughout this initial hour, inaccuracy reigned supreme. One woman said that Kennedy was looking at a dog in the car when he was first struck. Reports that the wounded president arrived at Parkland both conscious and unconscious were aired. The guman was on the second floor, or the fourth floor. A rifle found in a sniper's nest at the Texas School Book Depository was English, then German. And so on.For conspiracy theorists, some comments are vital to their case. JFK was struck in the back and the right temple, McGee reported. In a later phone conversation with McNeill he tried making sense of this. Perhaps the gunman's first shot was from the front, was Frank's postulation. The grisly Zapruder film (not available that day) bears out the report of a temple hit: before JFK is thrown back and to the left, his brain balloons out the rear of his head and flops around the side.Most accurate of all, and most disconcerting in hindsight, is the almost immediate setting up of Lee Oswald as a lone killer. By hour two, much was known about this 24-year-old \"radical\" who at that time had only been charged with the murder of a Dallas cop. He worked at the warehouse in question, had tried defecting to Russia, lived there a while, was married to a Russian girl. Clearly this was prelude to the assassination charges against Oswald that came before day's end.Except for the insanity of hour one, NBC's coverage of this tragedy was thorough and far-reaching. Comments from David Brinkley, Irving R. Levine and other correspondents, a remote from the U.N., witness tapes and films-- all were aired unedited. It was history as it unfolded, in its purest sense..I was in grammar school in Nov. '63 and was spared the first hours of NBC's coverage by a protective mother. But when my dad got home later that afternoon, he tuned in to see the bronze casket's arrival in D.C. I watched from the background, saw Jackie's blood-stained suit. This scene is also part of my SLP tape, but is certainly not on volume one of this two DVD set.",

    "review/text": "\"The Kennedy Assassination--Part 1\"features two hours of NBC-TV as-it-is-happening news coverage from Friday, November 22, 1963 -- the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in downtown Dallas, Texas, while riding in his open-top limousine through Dealey Plaza.This DVD, which comes from the video company \"Video Yesteryear\" (and is the exact same footage that can be found on its VHS counterpart), begins with NBC's live TV coverage at 12:57 PM (Dallas time), or 27 minutes after President Kennedy was shot from the Texas School Book Depository Building on Elm Street in Dallas.The DVD starts at the exact point when NBC began taping the coverage. The network had been on the air live for several minutes prior to when this footage begins, but technicians hadn't begun recording the telecast until quite a few minutes later.This raw footage of NBC's first-rate coverage of 11/22/63 includes the dramatic and sad moment when President Kennedy is pronounced dead by NBC newsman Frank McGee (as he gets the official word while talking on the phone to fellow correspondent Robert MacNeil, who was riding in the Dallas motorcade when the shooting occurred).Presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, 45 minutes after killing JFK from his 6th-floor perch in the Book Depository, shot and killed a Dallas city police officer (J.D. Tippit) in the Oak Cliff section of the city, and was captured shortly thereafter while attempting to hide in the darkened Texas Theater, a short distance from the Tippit murder scene. Tippit's murder and Oswald's arrest are also covered on this two-hour DVD.Part 2of this 2-disc DVD series includes another two hours of NBC-TV coverage from November 22nd, concluding with footage of new President Lyndon B. Johnson's first address to the nation from Andrews Air Force Base.This type of \"live\" coverage of a major news event is always very interesting to watch years and decades later. The capacity of NBC's facilities (and personnel) was stretched to their limits during the four days of virtually non-stop TV news coverage that occurred between approx. 1:40 PM (Eastern Time) on November 22nd and the conclusion of JFK's funeral on Monday, November 25th.The JFK assassination is considered by many as a turning point in the world of TV news reporting. A story this huge had never been covered before during the TV era. And when looking back on the original footage by all three major television networks (NBC, CBS, and ABC), there are a number of \"what do we do next?\" moments shown live to everyone in America. But, under the stressful circumstances, I think this was to be expected. In my opinion, the TV networks did an outstanding job of covering the sorrowful events of that November weekend in 1963.I think it's also very interesting to note (while viewing the many hours of TV footage that exist from those four days in November) that virtually ALL of the information being reported by all the TV networks favored a \"Lone Assassin\" scenario, with very, very little evidence and info to support any type of a \"conspiracy\" whatsoever. This fact, IMO, is quite telling.Because, in my view, IF a vast conspiracy and subsequent \"cover-up\" had been in place on November 22, 1963, I believe (given the immense amount of TV coverage, with reporters scrutinizing everything coming across their news desks during those initial hours and days after JFK was killed) at least some pieces of the conspiracy would have leaked through to the sweeping television coverage of the event.To think (as many theorists do) that these conspirators were so smart and quick to immediately eliminate virtually every last scrap of info leading to a \"plot\" of some kind, making sure none of the multi-shooter plan seeped through to the media, is to think (IMO) that any such evil-doers were akin to \"Superman\"!For example -- Virtually all initial reports concerning the exact number of rifle shots heard by witnesses in Dealey Plaza stated \"3 shots\". And while it's true that the very first report of the shooting from UPI's Merriman Smith (which was broadcast over all the TV networks) stated \"Three shots were fired...\", it's also worth noting that Smith's initial bulletin was NOT the only \"three-shots\" account that was reported during those early hours just after the shooting. For instance, Jay Watson of ABC affiliate WFAA-TV in Dallas (who happened to be in Dealey Plaza during the shooting and nervously reported the first bulletins to the unaware Dallas TV audience) is heard multiple times on November 22 saying he heard \"3 shots\" fired. Plus, other members of the media are also on film relaying their own personal beliefs that exactly three shots were fired by the assassin.Could these ultra-clever conspirators have somehow managed to \"manipulate\" several reporters who were relaying the news live to the world immediately after the event, and have them ALL report on hearing just \"three shots\"? Or were the conspiratorial shooters so good that they made 4 or 5 shots sound like only three? Highly doubtful, IMO.The \"synchronized\" shooting scenario is possible, I suppose. But I just don't buy into those theories claiming various conspiracy scenarios, some theories incorporating a ludicrously-enormous number of rifle shots being fired at the President (up to a dozen shots, per some of the crazier shooting scenarios), which is just utter nonsense, given the known and available evidence.The bulletins and almost all subsequent reports from November 22 to 24, 1963, supported precisely three shots being fired...all from ONE gun...and all being fired from ONE place (the consensus after a little initial confusion being the Book Depository Building which housed Lee Harvey Oswald and his rifle at 12:30 PM on November 22nd).And there were certainly no other suspects or co-conspirators connected with Oswald in either murder, including J.D. Tippit's.I challenge anyone to watch (or listen to) some of the as-it's-happening news coverage from November 1963 and try to reconcile that news coverage with anything closely resembling Oliver Stone's and Jim Garrison's crazily out-of-whack \"6-Shot, 3-Gunmen\" theory that is portrayed on the theater screen in Stone's 1991 film \"JFK\".You can't do it....because there's NOTHING close to that kind of multi-shooter nonsense to be found within ANY of the networks' news reports concerning the death of President Kennedy.The history-making date of 11/22/63 will be remembered forever as the tragic day when John F.

    "review/text": "While this edition is a bit dated (1998), this is a PBS series and it shows. The stories are event focused and not just a group of clips featuring narration. While you may have seen some of the clips before, there are stories you may not have heard of and they are covered in-depth with thoughtful and informative narration by Stacy Keach. Many of the stories are haunting and heartbreaking displays of the power of nature. This was PBS' attempt to do what the History Channel used to do so well. Savage Earth features four DVDs with a different focus. All feature interviews with victims, rescuers and experts.Hell's Crust: This is a volcanic eruptions episode, featuring Mt. Saint Helen' 1980 side eruption, two interviews I had not seen elsewhere, an earthquake in Italy that killed 3000, a plane caught in volcanic ash, the Westminster Islands 1973 volcanic eruption were resident used sea water to stop the lava flow and save their harbor, lava destroys a town in Hawaii. The Hawaii and Iceland segments are reminiscent of the later History Channel show, How the Earth Was Made, an excellent informational series.The Restless Planet: An Earthquake episode featuring the 1989 Loma Prieta bridge and freeway collapse, 1906 San Francisco quake, a Mexican quake of 1985, the 1994 Northridge quake and the Japanese quakes of 1923 and 1995 Kobe quake that was deadlier than the Northridge quake.Waves of Destruction: A Tsunami episode- Krakatoa's devastating 1883 tsunami that killed 36,000 (this episode is also a forerunner of a How the Earth Was Make episode), the 1946 Hawaiian tsunami in Hilo, efforts of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center - Okushiri Japan's 1993 tsunami, animals that can sense disasters and China's efforts to predict earthquakes - one effort that succeeded and one that failed, resulting in the deaths of 250,000 killed and 750,000 wounded.Out of the Inferno: A volcano episode- my favorite of this set- featuring Mt. Vesuvius' eruption that destroyed Pompeii, a Mexican 1943 eruption of an unknown volcano-residents fought to save their town and lost, San Juan was destroyed and lava flowed for nine years, a 1983 effort to divert lava from Mt. Etna from destroying a town, the heartbreaking story of the 1985 eruption of Columbia's Nevada Del Ruiz, where no one believed the scientists warnings and the town of Armero was destroyed and 25,000 killed by pyroclasitc mud flows; a 13 year old girl was trapped in the mud for days and died of a heart attack; Mt. Unzen in Japan whose huge eruption in 1991 killed renowned volcano experts Maurice and Katya Kraft in a pyroclastic flow that killed a total of 43 people, and the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, formerly dormant for 600,000 years that caused the evacuation of Clark Air Force base.I did enjoy this series and this set. The focus is similar to the History Channel's Wrath of God series that likewise featured disastrous acts of nature and the stories behind them. You many have seen some of these stories before, but there are interviews and information that I haven't seen in some newer documentaries. If you are looking for a clip show about disasters, this is not for you. If you are looking for a more in-depth experience, this set is a great collection of stories.",

    "review/text": "&quot;West of the Divide&quot; (1934) was the fourth of the poverty row Westerns than John Wayne made for Lone Star. Wayne plays Ted Hayden, who returns home after a long absence to try and find out who killed his father. Pretending to be an outlaw named Gat Ganns, our hero joins the gang of Mr. Gentry (Lloyd Whitlock), who, of course, turns out to be the dirty scoundrel who gunned down Hayden's pa. Gentry now has his eye on the farm of pretty Fay Winters (Virginia Faire Brown), so there is more than vengeance at play here for Mason.In addition to the young Wayne you have George Hays as Dusty Rhodes, who does not yet have the beard we all remember from his days as &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes, is getting to his famous on screen persona just like the Duke. The action in this one consists mostly of fist fights and does not feature any really great stunts by the legendary Yakima Canutt, who plays Gentry's henchman Hank and who usually provides the best thrills in these oaters.Written and directed by Robert N. Bradbury, who did most of Wayne's Lone Star films, &quot;West of the Divide&quot; is apparently a rip off of a 1932 western &quot;The Reckless Rider.&quot; Apparently enough time had passed for people to forget they had seen this story before, but then most of these poverty row Westerns have recurring elements (e.g., Wayne undercover with a gang, the damsel in distress). There is a nice moment at the end between Mason and his kid brother, Spuds (Billie O'Brien), but that does not save this from being a below average one of these films.",

    "review/text": "\"That Cold Day In The Park\" opens up in a rather innocuous fashion. A middle aged woman, Frances, is entertaining some dinner guests when she notices that a young man is sitting outside on a park bench. It begins to rain and the man attempts to take cover under a newspaper that had been thrown in the trash. After her guests leave, Frances goes outside and invites the young man inside her apartment to dry off. It quickly becomes clear that Frances is quite lonely and she tries her best to make her new guest very welcome. She is in no hurry for him to leave.Unfortunately, the film ends up doing a 180. At first this appears to be a fascinating look into a woman's lonely existence and her desperate quest for companionship. Instead, it descends into trashiness and an attempt to shock the viewer. Perhaps back in 1969 viewers found this to be something interesting in a freakish sort of way. In this day and age, however, the shock value is gone and its entertainment value lies in its ability to make the viewer laugh at the campiness of it all. Neither character is at all sympathetic so it ultimately leaves the viewer feeling disconnected. Sandy Dennis gives a wonderful performance but it is mostly wasted here. I only recommend this movie for those who enjoy bizarre social behavior.",

    "review/text": "This early Robert Altman film is a small (if deeply unsettling) little jewel, distinguished by a superb performance by Sandy Dennis. As a sheltered, nave, but creepily neurotic woman without a clue as to how the world of human relationships actually functions, she quietly dominates the screen. And she's well-matched by the young Michael Burns, far more cunning & manipulative than his initially mute charade suggests -- but he's in over his head, horribly so, as he discovers much too late in the game.And what is the game?Sandy Dennis' Frances is a spinster, emotionally swaddled & smothered, yearning for human love & human contact, but utterly lost in the real world outside her apartment. When she encounters Michael Burns (simply The Boy) in the park, she takes him home, which is fine with him. It's only as the story continues that he & we begin to understand just how troubled & dangerous Frances really is ...In some ways like \"The Collector,\" only with the roles reversed, this film differs in that its leads aren't really that sympathetic. Altman tends to shoot them through windows & panes of glass, distancing them, creating a detached & voyeuristic atmosphere. Add to that the washed-out lighting that exposes every bit of grime & decay, and the result is both clinically & uncomfortably intimate.The fact that it was made when movies were pushing against the last vestiges of censorship gives it a peculiar intensity. Nowadays everything can be said & shown; back then, it was genuinely daring to even try. So even though what we see is comparatively tame beside the explicitness of modern films, it possesses a genuine & powerful perversity that most modern films can't approach.It's not for casual viewing, and not something you'd want to watch too often. But it'll stay with you, whether you want it to or not. I'm only surprised that it isn't available on DVD yet, as it's the first of Robert Altman's many films to fully bear his imprint, and deserves greater exposure. Darkly recommended!",

She portrays Frances Austen, a lonely spinsterish type living in her deceased mother's apartment. She observes a lonely boy in the park on a cold, rainy day and invites him in. It's obvious that she's attracted to him, and that physical desire is new to her. The plot unfolds before us, and this beautiful 19 year old mute becomes Frances' toy. Of course it wouldn't be a Sandy Dennis film if ALL ended happily or the way we wanted it to, but know that from start to finish this is a film containing an actress in her best form. The direction is fantastic, the cinemotography rivetting. All in all a great piece. I highly recommend it.",

The movie \"That Cold Day in the Park\" takes a step back from the intense noire nature of the book, and i must say the book is excellent reading if You LIKE the dark side of reality. The movie would not rate R in this new era. No full nudity of anyone. No blood and gore, honest, though i cannot promise no violence. There is a disturbing psychological malfunction in the main character portrayed wonderfully by Sandy Dennis. And there are whimsical moments that will make You smile.",

Prim and cripplingly repressed, Frances lives a life of formal ritual, surrounded by friends who are at least 20 years her senior (they, like her staid apartment, appear to have been inherited from her dead mother). One rainy afternoon she spies a young man sitting alone on a park bench and invites him in to get dry. The blankly cherubic 19 year-old (Michael Burns) speaks not a word, but allows the solicitous woman to bathe, feed, and eventually house him. The boy's silent passivity (he's never named) and apparent lack of friends or family enables Frances to project a great deal of her own loneliness onto his situation, awakening in her an acute awareness of long-repressed desires. Before long, Frances' initial maternal concern gives way to darker obsessions as the boy comes to symbolize a last-chance grasp at life.Read full review:[...]",

I guess the copy we had was chopped up badly from use or something because there was no indication in the one I saw where it took place.I just know that it rained a lot. Some have said the young man was homeless, but I didn't get that feeling. Of course at this time the homeless people had not become a political figure like now. They were still considered to be bums, or hobos. At least where I was living they were. We had not broken our American culture down into the highly compartmentalized groups we have now. To me there was really no clear indication as to why he was sitting on the park bench in the rain as he was. Perhaps, it was because his \"sister/mother\" on the houseboat who was having sex with the other guy needed him to be gone for a while to accommodate her activity. So then you draw the conclusion the the lady who takes him in is a bit strange for doing so. And that bears out to be true, as she eventually makes him a prisoner (she thinks) in her house. Two things really sets the old girl off though. The first is when she realizes that he has been going out. She fixes that by nailing all of the windows shut, except for the one that is several floors down. The second pisser is when she hears him talking to the whore she has brought him. Now it is own and she comes unglued and, well, you know. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when I saw it, and often wondered why it never received any awards or even mention in the press. And why it was never on the TV. I guess the critics really did bury this one.",

    "review/text": "In this old film by Robert Altman, we discover how solitude for a young woman is a plague on her way to happiness and satisfaction. She comes to the point where she cannot even ask anyone for the contact she desires. She lives in a completely artificial and closed world. One day she brings into her world a stranger she finds in a park and she desires him but she treats him like a canaribird in a cage : she feeds him, she bathes him, she dresses him, she provides him with all comfort, she even provides him with a woman, but he cannot escape, he is a prisoner. It is only within that frame and after a long evolution that she finally finds the courage to ask for what she wants, and yet with no promise that the cage will be reopened. In other words, after a long life with her mother after the death of her father and among people who are from her mother's world, she is totally handicapped in society and unable to navigate properly among desires and obstacles. She can only take and possess. The other is no longer a human being but a toy, a doll in a way. A very sad picture of the loneliness of the solitary young lady in the upper middle-class....",

    "review/summary": "Mostly successful early Robert Altman feature, a psychological study of a woman's loneliness",
    "review/text": "I've been on something of a \"quest\" to see films from 1969 lately; the most obscure film of this project so far strangely enough comes from one of the most famous directors, Robert Altman, and stars a rather famous actress who had won an Oscar a couple of years before, Sandy Dennis. Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum in a rather disparaging capsule review called this the first Altman film that is recognizably \"his\"; not having seen COUNTDOWN, THE JAMES DEAN STORY, THE DELINQUENTS or any of his earlier TV work or shorts, I couldn't say. But it certainly does feature many Altman trademarks, most notably several instances of overlapping dialogue that are mixed quite forwardly on the soundtrack. Why the film languishes in obscurity is something of a mystery; it doesn't have a decent commercial DVD release anywhere and has fewer votes than every one of his succeeding films, including some reputedly dire stuff like HEALTH.While I like most of what I've seen from Altman, I don't LOVE most of it; he remains a director that I'm not entirely convinced by; and while this film isn't likely to change my mind, it is for most of it's running time quite an interesting psychological drama, with two characters playing games that gradually get more serious and intense, games they ought to know better than to keep playing - but of course if they did, where would the film be? Dennis plays Frances Austen, a wealthy 30ish spinster who lives on an upper floor in a fancy older apartment building across from a park in Vancouver (it's not really important where the film takes place, but the titles tell us, so I'm telling you). We see her at the beginning of the film hosting a gathering of several much older men and women; at first it's unclear as to her relationship but we eventually piece together that her mother was a member of this group and she has more or less succeeded to the same place. She notices a young man sitting on a bench in the rain in the park across the street; when the group leaves, she goes out to invite him to come in out of the rain.Right away we can see that Frances is a little weird - maybe a lot weird. Just inviting some stranger into her very nice apartment - that she lives in all alone - is the act of somebody who is lonely and more than a little bit delusional. From the get-go, we can almost feel her desires - a combination of motherliness and sexual attraction - for the man, a very beautiful 20ish blonde boy (Michael Burns) who seems to be mute. She brings him in - gets him food - lets him take a bath - dries his clothes - and lets him stay overnight in her spare room. No advances are made on either part, and we're as unclear as to the young man's motives as to Frances'. As the film continues we see that both are keeping secrets from each other - the young man's are more obvious, but Frances' are perhaps more important - even, in the end, vital.The psychological game play is generally well handled here, and both Burns and Dennis are really excellent - the first of the film I have to say I was almost completely entranced, as we slowly find out more and more about each character and wonder just where it could possibly all lead. But unfortunately - for me, anyway - the last act goes in a too-Hollywood conventional direction, making something of Frances that I'm not sure is either necessary or desirable. I'm not going to spoil it for you, see for yourself and judge whether I'm right in my assessment - but I think that in an era where ambiguity and open endings and elliptical narratives were more acceptable, the choices that Altman and screenwriter Gillian Freeman (working from a novel by Peter Miles) make seem a little too obvious and clich&eacute;d.Still it's a fine, creepy mood piece, and though as I said earlier it's not going to turn me around on Altman by itself, it certainly doesn't dissuade me from delving further into his work. It's nicely shot by ace cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs, though many of the virtues of his fine indoor work in Frances' beautifully appointed apartment are lost in this mediocre VHS. Still for fans of Altman or Dennis, this is worth getting, and who knows when a good widescreen DVD or BluRay transfer will be available?",

    "review/summary": "It was squirmy fascination, I know - 4 & 1/2 stars",
    "review/text": "This early Robert Altman film is a small (if deeply unsettling) little jewel, distinguished by a superb performance by Sandy Dennis. As a sheltered, nave, but creepily neurotic woman without a clue as to how the world of human relationships actually functions, she quietly dominates the screen. And she's well-matched by the young Michael Burns, far more cunning & manipulative than his initially mute charade suggests -- but he's in over his head, horribly so, as he discovers much too late in the game.And what is the game?Sandy Dennis' Frances is a spinster, emotionally swaddled & smothered, yearning for human love & human contact, but utterly lost in the real world outside her apartment. When she encounters Michael Burns (simply The Boy) in the park, she takes him home, which is fine with him. It's only as the story continues that he & we begin to understand just how troubled & dangerous Frances really is ...In some ways like \"The Collector,\" only with the roles reversed, this film differs in that its leads aren't really that sympathetic. Altman tends to shoot them through windows & panes of glass, distancing them, creating a detached & voyeuristic atmosphere. Add to that the washed-out lighting that exposes every bit of grime & decay, and the result is both clinically & uncomfortably intimate.The fact that it was made when movies were pushing against the last vestiges of censorship gives it a peculiar intensity. Nowadays everything can be said & shown; back then, it was genuinely daring to even try. So even though what we see is comparatively tame beside the explicitness of modern films, it possesses a genuine & powerful perversity that most modern films can't approach.It's not for casual viewing, and not something you'd want to watch too often. But it'll stay with you, whether you want it to or not. I'm delighted to see it's finally available on DVD, as it's the first of Robert Altman's many films to fully bear his imprint, and deserves greater exposure. Darkly recommended!",

    "review/summary": "Slow development, creepy content and dark lighting make for an occasionally dull movie",
    "review/text": "This is a dark movie, both in content and in the degree of lighting. Sandy Dennis plays Frances Austin, a single 32-year old woman living alone. As you learn later in the film, her parents are dead and her only interaction is with a group of older people where, with one exception her actual relationship with them is left ambiguous. The exception is an older man that has \"designs\" on her. Looking out the window on a cold and rainy day, Frances sees a young man sitting on a park bench.She invites him into her home and since he is a bit of a prankster, he pretends to be a mute, although we don't learn that until later in the movie that it is an act. Frances takes his wet clothes, lets him take a hot bath and feeds him. This begins an odd relationship as she buys him things and begins to treat him as a \"kept man.\" She goes out and buys him a complete set of new clothes and tries to get him interested in other things such as music.Frances is a woman whose loneliness had driven her to the very edge of madness, although it is clear that she is a disturbed personality, we have no idea to what extent she is unhinged. The movie moves very slowly in building the situation between Frances and the young man and there are also hints of bizarre behavior on the part of the man.The young man goes back to a houseboat where he lives and finds a woman that lives there in bed with a man. The woman has very little modesty around him, so at first it appears that there is a two-on-one threesome. However, later he uses the word \"Mom\" to her in a context that indicates that they share a mother. This is especially creepy because the \"sister\" strips down in front of him and takes a bath and there is a strong hint that they engaged in a sexual act. The \"sister\" also makes a comment to the young man about not talking for extended periods of time.At times early on you are uncertain who is the most disturbed between Frances and the young man but at the end it is clear which is sane and which is not. Due to the slow development of the story and the subject matter, this is one of those movies that some will detest and others will love. I doubt if there is a great deal of middle ground.",

    "review/text": "The plot of Cold Day In The Park is pretty simple: A sexually inexperanced spinceter-Sandy Dennis-sees a young man outside her house in the rain. She takes him in, feeds him, and cares for him. He makes himself at home for the next few days. Soon, his host gets the hots, but, she being very proper in 1969, can't quite bring herself to make the move. He, on the other hand, couldn't care less. He is more interested in eating her food.Eventually, the lady gets crazy, gets birth contol, and hires an ugly hooker, to do, I guess, what she can't bring herslef to. This women is a lot nuttier than we are first led to think, and things, let's just say. do not end well.This was the film Robert Altman made before M*A*S*H made him a big star. It was fillmed in Canada, and has a small, stage-like quality. The young man, played by Michael Burns--who played Blueboy on that famous Dragnet acid episode (I am the train, I am the train)-refuses to talk. So much of this film goes by without a lot of dioluge. There are also a lot of theatre games and pantamime Altman works into Cold Day In The Park.Personally, I like that late 60s style of flim making, where the pace is slow and there are long sections of quiet. The diolouge is almost written AROUND the plot, not in serivce of it, and you really have to sit quietly and watch the story slowly unfold.In our world of MTV and fast pace editing, 1969s Cold Day In The Park may seem tedious for modern viewers. But for those who enjoy a quiet film that works more on spareness and nuance than action, this is defiantely work watching.Inncidentally, the theme music is by Johnny Mandel, and Quincy Jones, on his Walking In Space album, covers it. This is also well worth checking out.",

    "review/text": "... has always been Werner Herzog's trademark, both in his early German films like Herz aus Glas (Heart of Glass) and in all of his American films (he migrated in 1995). But you have to credit him with respect for his audience -- at least most of us -- in that he plainly expects us to recognize a spoof, to enjoy being 'sent up' as we watch our neuroses reflected and exploited. He gives us plenty of semiotic signals, the enigmatic animals that always show up, for instance. In \"The Bad Lieutenant\", the animals are a camera-conscious alligator, a Siamese fighting fish in a water glass, and a pair of iguanas that may or may not be appearing on the Lieutenant's table. Innocent viewers might be jived into supposing that Herzog's Lieutenant is hallucinating in reaction to his fantabulous intake of cocaine, crack cocaine, cannabis and inhaled heroin, but when the Lieutenant claims to see the soul of a plugged thug break-dancing over his body, I know that you know that Werner knows that neither cocaine nor heroin is hallucinogenic. He's gaming the genre, amigos! Much in the manner that the Coen Brothers game the genre habitually. But Herzog is also gaming his American audience, needling the comfortable and the smug exploiting our insatiable thirst for vicarious violence and our addictions, both open and closeted. Or so I prefer to think ... If \"The Bad Lieutenant\" is not a sardonic spoof, if even one scene of it represents Herzog's vision of American reality, then either Herzog is a slanderer or America is a more disgusting cesspool of sociopathy than I want to believe.So let's, for our peace of mind, assume that \"The Bad Lieutenant\" is a comedy, though not of the laugh-out-loud variety. Then we can cosily regard the occasional quiddities of the script -- when the Lieutenant muses about whether fish dream, for example -- as deliberate miss-clues to the intentional meaninglessness of the film. Herzog is, after all, a professed nihilist, who has declared that the Universe is a godless and random place. To wrap up all the catastrophes looming over the Lieutenant in one quick scene replete with Dickens-worthy coincidences -- that is what happens, in an almost happy ending -- has to be recognized as the acme of snarky mockery of all cinema conventions.And Nicolas Cage plays along with Herzog's polymorphous perversity almost as convincingly in English as Klaus Kinski used to do in German. The Lieutenant has a bad back. I know what a bad back looks like and feels like. Cage does the bad back body-torque perfectly. He's too over-exposed, too familiar, to be effective as an actor in any role these days, but that's part of the schema of this film. All the other characters play generic \"noir\" without a wink.I've given this film five stars provisionally, in tribute to my own interpretation of it as a stealth spoof on America's sofa-bound paranoia. If that interpretation is too far-fetched, if this is supposed to be another raunchy thriller, then it wouldn't merit more than three stars from me.",

While watching it, I had to check the DVD case a couple of times to ensure it was directed by Herzog, but no: the iguana scenes, if nothing else, are his lion's paw.On the surface it's a story of a corrupt cop in post-Katrina New Orleans who manages to get the job done even though nobody expects him to. Haven't we seen this material before, and done much better? The dialogue is forgettable, the lessons the script purports to inculcate are murky when not hackneyed, and the film doesn't render much of the flavor of life in New Orleans. Worse, Nicholas Cage is not very convincing except in parts.But seeing over 2 hours of this cop messing up his life and everybody else's life made for some pretty uncomfortable viewing.

The two films are only similar in title and in the fact they have a crooked cop at the center of it all. The way the material is handled, as well as the story itself is completely different and while Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call, New Orleans will get just as much criticism as acclaim, it should not be compared directly to the original film.The film opens in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Nicolas Cage plays Terence McDonagh, who saves a drowning prisoner and winds up with severe back problems. He's prescribed vicodin and six months later he's been promoted to lieutenant and picked up a cocaine habit. The story involves five people being killed execution-style in a drug-related homicide and Terence investigating it while stealing drugs from the property room, misusing his power as lieutenant for sex, and all other sorts of \"bad\" things.Eva Mendes plays Frankie, a prostitute and Terence's girlfriend, while Val Kilmer appears here and there as Terence's partner Stevie. The film has many other well-known actors popping up such as Brad Dourif (as Terence's bookie), Fairuza Balk, Michael Shannon, and Xzibit.Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant didn't have much of a plot...The story just sort of followed the lieutenant through his downward spiral of depravity. Herzog's follows his lieutenant through a story while illustrating his depravity; which, I'd argue, isn't quite as depraved as the original. This film does borrow some of the elements of that previous film, but if you were to drop the title you'd realize this is a completely different film.The film, aside from being glossier than the gritty original film, also has no problem going completely over-the-top or lurching over into something random and weird. The \"iguana scene\" is so ridiculously random, yet it gives this film it's own unique stamp in a way. I haven't seen many movies by Herzog but there are some creative touches which could have only come from his mind; the scene with the iguana and the scene with the alligator for example. Despite Herzog being a terrific, highly respected director I'm not sure he was taking his work here entirely seriously here opting for having fun rather than making a masterpiece.Performance-wise, Nicolas Cage can not match the soul-bearing performance by Harvey Keitel. A lot of people don't like Nicolas Cage at all; I think with the right material that Nicolas Cage is one of the greatest actors working today, never better than when he's playing a character that's completely unhinged. Terence McDonagh is a great role for him and no one besides Cage would've interpreted the character in this way. However, his performance is not flawless. While entertaining and fun to watch, there are some creative choices I'm not sure about such as when Cage's accent fades to a different accent mid-way through the movie for no apparent reason. The performances all over-the-top in one way or another, although Kilmer and Shannon are pretty subdued over all. No one will win an Oscar for acting in this film, but they make their character's fun to watch.The film has some good cinematography and Herzog picked some great locations to film; the film has a film-noir quality at times, but the musical score by Mark Isham didn't fit with the overall tone at times. Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call, New Orleans works as entertainment, but it didn't draw me in the way the first did. Ferrara's film is a tragedy, a compelling character study and morality tale. Herzog's film is a comedy, entertaining and unique. I'm not sure there's a point in telling this story without the morality or redemptive aspect to it. As I said though, I will not base my enjoyment of this film off of how it compares to the other.This film is marvelously weird and the pairing of Herzog and Cage, both known for being quirky in their professions, is a match well-made. What other director would have a shoot-out scene where the main character says, after a few people are shot, \"Shoot him again; his soul's still dancing?\" And who, aside from Cage, could say such a line? Furthermore, who would actually film the dancing soul? It's not a perfect film and it's not the masterpiece a few critics have called it. It does deserve to stand-alone from the Ferrara film and hopefully those who watch this film will be lead to watch the original. There will be those who absolutely loathe this film and that's to be expected. Over-the-top, ridiculous, and unique; I found it hard not to be amused and entertained. The first film left me shaken and stunned, this film left me shaking my head at how a similar story could be handled in such a different way.GRADE: B-",

    "review/text": "Cage on Crack. Exactly. This is what you get. This is not a film for everyone. You have to have a great sense of the absurd and a great sense of humour.Post Katrina and the world is dark and dreary and so is the lieutenant. He has hurt his back trying to save a prisoner and can hardly walk. Watching Cage walk from the backside is interesting, his suit coat looks like he left the hanger in and the right side of his body is hanging. He has a shuffling sort of walk that looks painful., and he is taking Vicodin, pot, crack and whatever he can get his hands on. His new assignment is to find the killer of a family of five- probably a drug killing. The Lt. does his best and even on multiple drugs and no sleep for days, he is a magnificent detective. As his boss says 'The only criminal he can't catch is himself'. I figure this must be the reason they keep him on. He has many complaints about his behavior that come rolling in, and his gun is taken away. But, somehow, he keeps on with a job,sometimes with the crooks and sometimes with the good guys. His girlfriend, Eva Mendes, is a prostitute, a high priced one from the looks of her apartment.His father was in the force, but is now trying to recover from alcoholism. The Lt is just doing the best he can.Lots of strange filming of crocodiles and iguanas from Werner Herzog, the director, but somehow the film gels. The violence and the drugs all intersperse with the storyline. Cage does a wonderful over the top job with his role and with a few laughs thrown in with the rest of the misery, this is a film I liked.Recommended. prisrob 04-19-10City of Angels (Snap Case)Encounters at the End of the World",

    "review/text": "Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans (Werner Herzog, 2009)There are a lot of rumors floating around about this movie. If I'm reading between the proper lines, here's the story that seems right to me: Werner Herzog had a script about a crazy cop going on a rampage. It was called Port of Call: New Orleans. The movie's producers had the rights to the name Bad Lieutenant, and were trying to turn Abel Ferrara's masterpiece--which Herzog had never seen (and to my knowledge still hasn't)--and thus insisted on the title having Bad Lieutenant in it somewhere. Herzog's compromise was to simply use both titles, ignore the Abel Ferrara connection altogether, and go ahead and make the movie he wanted to make. Thus, the correct way to approach PoCNO is to ignore the title altogether and go into it with no expectations. And if you do this, you are almost guaranteed one hell of a good time.Plot: Terence McDonagh (Nicolas Cage in the role he was born to play) is a police officer in the city of New Orleans. He is so corrupt that the very word \"corrupt\" has ceased to have meaning, as it relates to Terence McDonagh; he lives in a world of his own. Assigned the case of five murdered illegal Senegalese immigrants in what may have been a drug deal gone wrong, McDonagh finds himself in close with Big Fate (played by rapper Xzibit), a New Orleans crime lord who realizes as much as McDonagh does that a partnership between the two could be mutually beneficial...Plot, here, is secondary; this is a movie about Nic Cage doing massive amounts of drugs, wandering around New Orleans in a haze, encountering criminals and rogue iguanas, and once in a while attempting to do his job (and doing it so ineptly that he can't help but be promoted, as we see in the opening scene). If you're looking for some sort of coherence, you're in the wrong movie; this is an impressionist romp in the same vein as, say, The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser or Even Dwarfs Started Small rather than the kind of movie Herzog has become known for over the years (either the brilliant documentaries or the obsessive, driven fictional films like Invincible or the films he made with Klaus Kinski). It's not meant to be anything more than a hefty dose of fun, and as long as you take it on its own terms, you'll have a blast with it. ***",

    "review/text": "I have to say I was somewhat horrified when I saw the trailer for this; it looked very generic and unintersting. The first thought in my head after hearing about this collaboration of Herzog and Cage was 'trainwreck'. I mean, I knew it would be at least an interesting wreck, but I was not expecting much. I was dead wrong.Also, let me say that the original film by Abel Ferrara is one of my all time faves, and Harvey Keitel's performance is the answer I automatically give to anyone who asks what my all time favorite film performance is.That being said.....While the first film is dark and just brutal, this film is actually quite funny. With the exception of drug addict cops and gambling debts, the films are quite different. The first was def more in your face w/both it's graphic portrayal of gutter life and the ever-present religious overtones. This film is far more subtle, both in it's scenery and supporting cast, all across the board I might add; both the locations and characters are there, just waiting to be noticed for their authenticity in even the smallest part. There is reality to them all, much of which can be very comedic. The same can be said for the backdrop of New Orleans; it plays second to the human cast, but there is much to be noticed upon multiple viewings.Nicolas Cage is perfectly cast and pull this one off flawlessly; his energy and humor, crossed w/a few somber and even emotional moments(esp. the scene where he talks about his treasure hunt w/Eva Mendes....). Cage makes every scene enjoyable, which is basically every scene. His acting is consistent throughout, even changing his tone of voice after being up for 3 days(as people who have been packing their noses for 72 hours with no sleep often do.....almost a godfather type thing), with his hunched back and .44 magnum hanging from his belt. This may be Cage's best film, and he deserves so much credit for this performance. I actually had fun watching him, and I never thought of him as Nicolas Cage, despite some obvious 'Cage-isms' here and there in terms of delivery. But you can tell he was into this part, and the result is almost more of a comic tour de force than anything else....he delivers lines like 'don't worry about your clothes right now...this is uncut dope!' with a certain comic timing almost, and like Keitel, you are just waiting to see what he will do next.Some people found this movie boring and linear; while straightforward on the surface(kind of reminded me of an early 70's cop movie at times...), it deepens upon multiple viewings. You can tell Cage and Herzog made some kind of connection, and to be honest I am thankful someone actually funded this and got the talent involved. You can tell there was not a huge budget for this movie, which I think helped in terms of getting unknown/lesser known actors to fill many of the smaller but important roles. It adds a certain authenticity. The result is something truly original, funny, but by no means without it's share of corruption, brutality, and intense moments. Not very violent, but there is def a feeling of something heavy coming throughout, given some of the situations.I would also say there are some surprises in here I have not seen in any film; Herzog has a great control over this film, and from the opening scene in the flooded jailhouse to the final frames, you can see he put his heart into this film. Plus there are 3 things in this movie I have never seen before in any movie; they were surprising and gut busting. You are lucky if you get one good twist in a movie nowadays.This is based on seeing 4 times in the theater, but I can only imagine it will look fantastic on blu ray. An odd film to some, lame to others. But hopefully some will see this for the brilliant movie it is and get past the title or any comparisons. They are both great films to me, and completely different.A great example of what talented people all across the board can do w/basically no money, and outshine most 'funded' movies...Go figure.***UPDATE: Looks amazing on Blu Ray; This is how this movie was meant to be seen. Great lighting, color schemes, location use, and detail in every scene. The theater did not do this movie justice visually speaking...***",

    "review/text": "Who could have guessed that the man who helmed art house classics like \"Fitzcarraldo\", \"Woyzeck\" and \"Aguirre the Wrath of God\" would one day make a film entitled \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call-New Orleans\"? Then again, one might argue that the iconoclastic Werner Herzog's career would be nothing, if not perennially unpredictable.Herzog's latest film, arguably adorned with the year's most unwieldy title for squeezing onto a marquee, is a (sort of) sequel to Abel Ferrara's controversial 1992 neo-noir, \"Bad Lieutenant\" which was about a drug and gambling-addicted NYC homicide investigator. In that film, Harvey Keitel gave a fearless and maniacal performance as a \"cop on the edge\" who made most of the criminals he was paid to apprehend look like choir boys. Not an easy act to follow-but Nicholas Cage proves to be more than up to the task here.To my observation, Cage has demonstrated two basic personas in his repertoire over the years. First, there is the Slack-Jawed, Dead-eyed Mumbler (\"Peggy Sue Got Married\", \"Moonstruck\", \"Red Rock West\", \"Leaving Las Vegas\"). His other character is the Manic, Wild-eyed Loon (\"Wild at Heart\", \"Raising Arizona\", \"Kiss of Death\", \"Face/Off\"). Personally, I get a real kick out of his performances in the latter mode, and it goes without saying that you can now add the role of \"bad\" Lt. Terence McDonagh to that section of his resume.As far as I could glean, there is no effort to bridge with Ferrara's film and explain how Lt. McDonagh transitioned from NYC to New Orleans. Not that it really matters. Anyone who has followed Herzog's career probably has figured out by now that he is perfectly content to wallow in his own peculiar universe. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing-it's what makes his work so continually interesting to me. The \"plot\" ostensibly concerns itself with the murder of a Senegalese family, and the police investigation. Not that the \"plot\" really matters, either (although Herzog's post-Katrina milieu is quite atmospheric).No, if you are going to watch this film (which has \"destined to become a midnight cult item\" written all over it), I'll tell you right now that you needn't concern yourself with trying to follow the (probably deliberately) convoluted and complex murder mystery. You'll be too busy asking yourself questions like \"Did I just see what I think I just saw?\" and making exclamations like \"Oh no-he DIDN'T!\" as Herzog and screenwriter William M. Finkelstein proceed to turn the \"cop on the edge\" genre on its head with every blackly comic twist and turn. Cage and the rest of the cast (including Val Kilmer, Eva Mendes, Fairuza Balk, Brad Dourif and Jennifer Coolidge) all seem to be in on the director's joke, and play it to the hilt. By the time you've processed Herzog's use of the \"alligator/iguana-cam\", you will have to make a decision to either run for the exit, or go with the flow and say to yourself \"Well...I've bought the ticket, I'm gonna take the ride.\"This is easily the most twisted noir I've seen since \"Tough Guys Don't Dance\". So do I think you should rush out and see this? That depends. If you are looking for a refreshing alternative to the usual Hollywood offerings, by all means, knock yourself out. But don't say I didn't warn you-if you don't consider an inspired line like \"Shoot him again-his soul is still dancing!\" to be pure genius, then you'd best keep away.",

It's also sort of because this bad lieutenant isn't really the totally corrupt person the original one was. In fact, when they have him do things inspired by the original, they don't come off as probable because Nicholas Cage simply doesn't exude the stench of rottenness that Harvey Keitel did to perfection. What's worse is that Cage is not only not rotten, he's also not capable of looking at himself and repenting, which Keitel's character did in spades. Even worse is that the new bad lieutenant gets no punishment for his crimes. Nor does Lady Luck abandon him. In short, this movies lacks the morality and moral of the original. Then, too, the original was a tightly knit, suspenseful movie that keeps you glued to the screen. This version is long and meandering so that I at least kept wishing it would end. The only reason I didn't turn it off before it did was that I had a guest watching with me. Get the original if you want to see a good bad lieutenant.Bad Lieutenant",

    "review/text": "We all know the Nicholas Cage of recent years who seemingly has made one hackneyed movie after another just to indulge yet another big pay check and spending spree. Those of us who had been following him from the beginning, who loved his quirky indie films with offbeat directors, were horrified at what he'd become. Now he has teamed with the ultimate indie, offbeat director, Werner Herzog, to reclaim his roots. I believe that both Herzog and Cage have made a movie that is an extended metaphor about post Katrina New Orleans. Cage IS that post Katrina beleaguered city. He starts out the film injured and heroic and then zig zags through the rest of the film exhibiting the behavior of a post traumatic stress disorder patient who is untreated, like such a soldier from Vietnam or Iraq. For Herzog's part, he's always been about imagery and metaphors and he doesn't disappoint here in rendering the ultimate imagery and metaphor for post Katrina New Orleans. This is a very different movie from Abel Ferrara's movie starring Harvey Kietel set in New York. That film was a true character study of a really bad cop who worked for the NYPD. It was also excellent but very different from this film. Is Cage Herzog's new alter ego Klaus Kinski (his late leading man)? I doubt it. Although the two are an excellent pairing, Kinski and Herzog were a one off as a movie making team.",

He's not afraid to have sex with a girl outside a club just to confiscate the drugs in her purse. Nor is he afraid to risk his life in the call of higher justice. And when a family is murdered, he's royally pissed. Or maybe he's just looking to score a cheap high.THE BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL-NEW ORLEANS is not for everyone. It's not your average cop movie; there is very little to like in Terence, who in the hands of Nicholas Cage comes across as a needy, sadistic, drug-addicted purveyor of law and order. Sure, he's got a couple redeeming features; he'll do the right thing, eventually, if enough innocent people get hurt. In the hands of Nicholas Page (finally displaying his immense talent, after several years of slacking), Terence is strangely likable, and yet you're always afraid of what he'll do next. His friends aren't much better; his girlfriend (a haunting Eva Mendes) is a druggie and prostitute; and his partner (Val Kilmer, showing a fine return to form and grossly underused) is almost as crazy as he is.Werner Herzog's direction is at times a bit too trippy for its own good; we get lingering shots of nonexistent iguanas and dancing souls that are absolutely hilarious at first; but the shots stretch on too long, and the humor is lost. Yet, when the film hits the right notes, it's almost like nothing you've ever seen before. You HAVE seen it--numerous times--but the fact that the film comes off as original is truly impressive. We can thank Nic Cage for that; his energetic, over-the-top performance roots this film in irreality, giving it that hard, dark edge that we don't get much of anymore. Watch this film at your own risk; you may come away thinking \"what the hell\"...but you may come away thoroughly impressed, as well.",

    "review/text": "I was surprised that my theater actually got this movie today. It doesn't seem to be getting much play around the country and will likely hit DVD before most people can witness this strange little gem. I read some really positive reviews from critics and movie watchers alike, so I figured I would give it a shot. I haven't been a fan of Nicolas Cage for a long time, mainly because he seems to be taking every bad movie and turning in a subpar performance. Now that we know he has money problems in real life, it at least makes sense now. I'm happy to say the he is back in top form here. His character is as bad as Denzel Washington's in Training Day and he is played in the same over the top way, without seeming to be unbelievable. He has a hunched back and carries his .44 magnum in the front of his pants wherever he goes. Most of the characters in Bad Lieutenant are predictable scum, but Cage throws so much into this performance that you really have no clue what's going to happen from one scene to the next. He is at his crazy best here and reminded me that few people can play weird as well as this man. Eva Mendes is looking pretty good here and her acting is decent, but her role doesn't amount to much other than a slight bright spot for Cage's loose cannon. Val Kilmer shows up and is quite good, but he is barely in the movie. Maybe five minutes tops.On the negative side, this film is very dark and often mean, but thankfully some humor forces it's way through in some of these scenes. There are also some bizarre visuals, such as a point of view shot from an alligator and another from a couple of iguanas for no reason at all. A few scenes also linger on a bit to long and the pacing slows at times, but I was sucked into this corrupt man's life and couldn't keep my eyes off the screen.

    "review/summary": "Herzog meets Hammett: baffling at first, but give it a chance.",
    "review/text": "At first, Herzog's latest was just plain exhausting. The picture-perfect ending initially came across as a sneering, nihilistic slap in the face after all the misdeeds accumulated in the movie. But then I got to thinking. In the scenes between Nicolas Cage and Xzibit, Cage's character adopts precisely the one attitude that has any chance of success. Not that he'd consciously planned it, but he couldn't have done a better job if he had. A character like Big Fate understands extravagantly sleazy and reckless behaviour, it fits into his worldview. If one demonstrates sufficient extremes of recklessness (like pulling a gun on him while driving), that just might sort of begin to elicit respect, assuming one didn't instantly get killed. In that situation, acting crazy is the only way to stay alive.Despite being high all the time, the lieutenant pulls off a very delicate balancing act. Thugs come to extort money from him, threaten to disfigure his girlfriend and shoot his dog. He can't fight them, but showing any sign of weakness will just goad them into carrying out their threats. So, he agrees to their demands for money, but acts in a businesslike, sleazy manner. He won't hand the girl over to the thugs, but only because (he says) she hasn't had time to make herself look attractive. Miraculously, they don't press the point. He's speaking exactly their language.So, in the end, the lieutenant does a neat job of work, in a sense. He solves the murder of the drug-dealing immigrants, and the culprit is punished, though not for that particular crime, and not in a particularly orderly fashion. It's important to note that the lieutenant insists on the mobster's arrest; Val Kilmer's character wants to play the corrupt cop and steal the mobster's drugs, but the lieutenant forces him to make the arrest. He does jeopardize a bunch of innocent people's lives, but happily they suffer no permanent damage. A few thugs died, but they were obviously pretty low types, so the film's audience doesn't have to feel bad.If you've ever read the classic crime novels ofDashiell Hammett, you'll recognize this setup. Hammett's novelRed Harvestexplores this idea of the morally ambiguous crime-fighter, who descends into the underworld, engages in questionable acts, makes all kinds of bargains and alliances with criminals, pretends to be after money or women, while all this time, deep down, none of this really affects him, and he is truly motivated only by his distaste for the criminals. There is not much inner monologue; you see what the detective does, but you're often left guessing as to why. As a result, bodies pile up and many thugs die gruesome deaths, but the idea is that they all had it coming anyway, so the reader is supposed to ignore the lack of due process.Hammett's concept was, \"Plans are all right sometimes. And sometimes just stirring things up is all right.\" The detective doesn't really have a master plan, he just acts on instinct and eventually things work out. That idea seems to be present in Herzog's film, and also in his previous filmRescue Dawn, where Christian Bale's character also had a sort of vague general moral code, but then just did whatever came into his head, and counted on his instinct and willpower to get him through. Cage's character here just throws himself headfirst into the chaos, always going all the way and living on the edge, but carefully modulating his reactions to suit the situation at hand.Fortunately, Herzog tempers his paean to impulsiveness with sympathetic details. At one point, the lieutenant starts to look, hilariously, like a harried family man, trying to simultaneously handle witness protection for the murder case, ferry his girlfriend to safety, and even take care of his parents' dog. This is completely goofy, but it shows you that he does have a bizarre sense of responsibility. This makes it easier to accept him than it is to like the detective in Red Harvest, who has no human connections of any kind. It also makes the film more suspenseful, as he means well, but seems to be spiraling out of control.So, the message (if there is one) is mostly about the joys of winging it and throwing caution to the winds. Which fits into Herzog's worldview well enough. And just in case you forget who's behind the camera, he recycles the music from the end ofStroszekduring a hysterical hallucination scene. There are many other odd images in the film, mostly involving iguanas, as well as occasional philosophical lines in the dialogue that would never be spoken by real-life thugs (although they do greatly resemble Herzog's narration inGrizzly Man), but are convincing enough in the film. Many of the generic supporting characters are given just enough quirks to be interesting, like the awesome dude with a mullet who says \"whoa\" and \"oh yeah.\"Herzog's reinvention of himself as a Hollywood director in the 2000s, starting withInvincible, is an odd development. Maybe it's because, these days, no one is willing to fund the kinds of films he used to make, and even a more mainstream film like this can't get released unless it's billed as a remake (Herzog's film has nothing in common with Abel Ferrara's \"Bad Lieutenant,\" the title was forced on him by the producers). \"Port Of Call New Orleans\" won't supercedeclassicHerzog (though I'd love to hear him try to explain where the \"poetic truth\" is here), but it is suspenseful and memorable. After one thinks a bit about the details that stayed in one's mind, it becomes clear that the film is very entertaining and delivers a great time.",

    "review/text": "Werner Herzog's \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans\", starring Nicolas Cage is a crazy, way over-the-top performance that is completely entertaining. I loved the film, most people hated the film. I think a Herzog film is an acquired taste - the film will either seem brilliant, or really stupid, depending upon your liking or dis-liking for his style. One thing is for certain, with a Herzog film, you will not be getting the same stale Hollywood film that panders to the masses. It's very difficult to be neutral about a film like Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans. I suspect many people will find the film some kind of bizarre parody of a cop film.The film is very, very, loosely based on the original Bad Lieutenant (1992) starring Harvey Keitel (an incredibly great film). In the new version, Nicolas Cage plays a drug-addicted, gambling-addicted, corrupt, violent, and insane cop who is the lead on a homicide case. Along the way, he endangers his prostitute girlfriend, his father's dog, and almost everyone he knows. At one point, under the influence of crack, Cage starts to hallucinate iguanas. Very funny, very bizarre, quirky, weird, and highly entertaining. This film sank without a trace financially. Some fans speculate this film is destined to become a cult classic, perhaps watched at frat parties 10 or 20 years from now.",

    "review/text": "\"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans\" isn't a remake or sequel to the 1992's \"Bad Lieutenant\" directed by Abel Ferrara. It's a reconception of the \"bad cop\" concept in post-Katrina New Orleans. Lt. Terence McDonaugh (Nicolas Cage), a homicide detective with the NOPD, keeps himself going by dosing Vicodin for his chronic back pain, which leads to heroin, cocaine, crack, and, by the time he is called upon to investigate the massacre of a Senegalese family, any mind-altering substance he can get his hands on. Terence tracks down the killers, creatively abuses his power to obtain enough drugs to sustain him, gambles, threatens honest citizens, rescues his prostitute girlfriend Frankie (Eva Mendes), and weaves such a tangled web of corruption that it's doubtful a crackhead cop could keep track of it all.I wonder to what extent this was intended as parody. Ostensibly, we have a police officer, a sort of crooked cop with a conscience stuck in an existential nightmare, whose bad habits are way out of control and whose world is crashing in on him: his victims are filing complaints, his gambling debts are due, goons are threatening him, and he has to babysit his alcoholic father's dog, while conducting a murder investigation. Terence has managed to stay one step ahead of his troubles through sheer audacity. But he's a lunatic. It can't last. There are some goofy reptile's-eye-view shots that director Werner Herzog must have intended to make fun of the characters. But how much of the rest of it was supposed to be funny? Nicolas Cage isn't acting. He's doing shtick, and he's barely doing that.The murder suspects come from out of nowhere. In fact, there is a lot of inattention to detail and continuity, where characters do and say things that don't fit. The dialogue is so bad that, with my eyes closed, I would swear this is a low-budget exploitation flick. Terence's drug-addled rants and rampages are so bizarre that no one would take him seriously. They'd have him committed. His indiscretions eventually congeal into a plot so absurd that I didn't know what to make of it. Watching \"Bad Lieutenant\", there were times when I was almost certain it was intended as a joke. Then it seemed to desperately want to be taken seriously. Then back to silliness. Whatever it is, it's not worth 2 hours of anyone's time. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. And William Finkelstein certainly deserves a mention for his putrid screenplay.",

Throw Val Kilmer into the mix, and you have a crew that defines all that is wrong with Hollywood -- lazy, bloated, and contemptuous of its audience.Much of \"Bad Lieutenant II\" has the feel of any one of a number of recent video games, and some scenes look that they came right out of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. You have the cardboard thugs, the cynical cops, and the tough but caring black police chiefs.The blending of these two genres, gaming and film, is a sad evolution in entertainment, and BL II looks to be one of many new films that will blur the lines so that Hollywood studios and game production companies can cut costs. Instead of going straight to video, movies like this will go straight to video game -- that is how bad this film is.The brain-dead plot, the absurd dialog, you name -- this film has it. I know Nick Cage has some financial problems involving bad real estate deals, and some guy was stalking him, but he appears to be at the end of his rope here, desperate for a paycheck. The same could be said about Val Kilmer.But I'd have to single out the writer for absolute condemnation. For example, in one scene, Cage gets his weapon (a massive .45 that he usually keeps, holster-less, jammed in his waistband, awfully close to his left testicle) confiscated by what equates to some goons from Internal Affairs. He is relegated to the evidence room, where he can plunder the stash of confiscated drugs. TWO SCENES later, he is running around, with that same weapon longed in his crotch. Such is the level of contempt Cage and his crew has for the poor souls that they can sucker into watching this mess.I guess that Herzog, et al, assume that we are all dope-addled retards, like the character Cage plays in BL II (perhaps he is not acting), and we won't notice gaping holes in the plot, wildly absurd exchanges of banal chatter (\"Do fish dream?\"), camera work worthy of GTA 2, and corny, contrived scenes (the junkie cop is stuck with an adorable dog, his whore girlfriend, and a key witness to a homicide, driving around in his police cruiser, trying to get square with his bookie; or something like that...)If you get the urge to sample this pile steaming garbage, do yourself a favor -- rent the original Bad Lieutenant and watch that masterpiece until the urge passes.",

    "review/text": "Here I am with Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans more like Port Of S h i t. Cause this movie was poorly done it has no right to have the name Bad Lieutenant. In fact Abel Ferrara openly against this movie. Werner Herzog said \"I have no idea who he is I've never seen a film of his.\" Yeah you must of known enough to direct a sequel. I mean I don't blame Abel Ferrara for being mad I mean Bad Lieutenant which I reviewed the other day is a great character piece. This movie is way to long too slow paced & the acting isn't all that great the editing is bad. Made on a budget of $25 million made $10 million. Directed by Werner Herzog he directed Nosferetu & Rescue Dawn. Rescue Dawn is better than this movie. If you like this movie that's fine anytime I rant on a movie it's against the movie not the fans. This won't be a huge rant but still I don't care for this movie. It stars Nichols Cage as Terrence McDonagh, Val Kilmer as Stevie Pruit, Eva Mendes as Frankie Donnenfeld, Xzibit as Big Fate & Brad Dourif Ned. The story is Terrence McDonagh & his partner Stevie Purit are investigating a murder of this family who are illegal immigrants from Senegal. Their looking for this guy named Big Fate. You have them copy stuff off of the original Bad Lieutenant you have the lead doing drugs & betting on sports only this time it's College Football. He has a girlfriend he does drugs with. This character isn't interesting Nicholas Cage doesn't make it work not saying that Nicholas Cage is a bad actor but this isn't his kind of movie. Keitel was over the top in the in Bad Lieutenant but he didn't over do it. You have a scene where up to this young couple & starts messing with them like with the 2 Jersey Girls in in the original. He has s e x with the girl & takes her drugs. Lieutenant McDonagh & Lieutenant Pruit round up different people they find this boy who was a witness to the murders. McDonagh gets a call from his Girlfriend Frankie to come to Biloxi the witness goes with him & McDonagh finds out that this guy has been beating her he beats that guy up who tells him that he's well connected. They get back to New Orleans at this restraunt the witness goes missing & McDonagh goes to that guys Grandma's House she takes care of this elderly lady. He gets mad cause they won't tell him where the boy went to he goes off the deep end cuts off the old lady's oxegen so he can get some information. I'm sorry but that's way too over the top even for me. He is told that the boy went to England. So this plot point goes nowhere. All this cop does is get himself in more trouble which I will get to. He gets a call by Frankie cause he owes money to this mobster dude he has 2 days to pay up. He gets Frankie out of town has her stay with his parents there is this dramatic BS going on with McDonagh's Father & Step Mother which I didn't care about. When the 1st movie the simple things & straight forward things did so much more for me. McDonagh has been put on modified duty for his recent actions. That's ok cause he has a guy that works evidence that will get his gun back for him. McDonagh shows Frankie this old tool shed he used to play in as a kid & it's more stuff that could've been cut out. He goes on & on about this spoon he dug up in the yard as a kid. McDonagh gets together with Big Fate's crew he uses them to help him take down those mob guys he owes money to. McDonagh has Big Fate smoke his Lucky Crack Pipe so he can get his DNA. I will admit that I did find his plan brillant use them to kill the people he owes money get that guys DNA to get him arrested. He has the pipe planted at the crime scene where that family was killed & Big Fate & his gang are busted. McDonagh's partner Stevie wants to kill Big Fate & take his drugs but McDonagh wants to take him in. So for performing his duties professionally he is promoted to Captain & he Frankie his father & step mother are clean & sober. Frankie is pregnet. Oh but McDonagh still has his slip up lol. Bad Lieutenant Port Of S h i t is poorly done I know it's not a direct sequel but even as a stand alone movie it's no different than any other crime drama movie on the direct to video market. It's 2 hours & 2 minutes too long 10 or 15 could've been cut out of it the acting isn't much to run home about. Werner Herzog gets the pass for being a high brow director. Nicholas Cage gave an on & off performance. Val Kilmer didn't get much to do. Eva Mendes was ok. Xzibit was terrible. I can't believe I left out Brad Dourif but he didn't get anything to do. I said in my review for Bad Lieutenant that it's not for everybody cause of the content & subject matter. This movie isn't for everybody cause it is lame.",

    "review/text": "This film is notable not only because it's directed by offbeat directing great Werner Herzog, but also because it stars Nicolas Cage at his insanely wacky best. Add to that a post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans and you've got some cinema that is, at the least, intriguing and, at the most, a wild, humid, corrupt-cop, gambling and drug-fueled ride. Frankly, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Cage is at his best here.Cage plays Lt. Terence McDonagh. At the beginning, he is, as far as the viewer can tell, a slightly corrupt cop. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, he and his partner (played by Val Kilmer) discover a locked up criminal about to be submerged by rising waters in an abandoned jail. Despite his partner's desire to leave the prisoner to drown, McDonagh leaps into the water to unlock the man . . .CUT TOA doctor's office where Lt. McDonagh is getting a check up and is informed that his back--apparently injured when McDonagh leapt into the water--will always give him pain. In the ensuing scenes, we get to see McDonagh taking copious amounts of drugs, meeting with his prostitute girlfriend (which he may or may not have had at the beginning of the movie), betting on sports, taking advantage of nightclubbing couples for sex and investigating the apparent drug-related death of a family. The lengths that McDonagh goes to to solve the murders while simulataneously extracting himself from various precarious situations involving his addictions test the very limits of believability . . . but the ride is fantastic and enjoyable, particularly since Nicolas Cage gets crazier and crazier as everything comes to a head.The movie certainly won't be to everyone's tastes, but give it a chance. You might be pleasantly surprised. (I frankly thought it was a better cinematic endeavor than Abel Ferrara's \"Bad Lieutenant\" with Harvey Keitel.) Interestingly, Val Kilmer is strangely absent throughout all but the beginning and end of the movie. It would have been good to see more of him. And I disagree with the assessments that Val has gone over the edge . . .",

    "review/text": "Is it a great film? No. Is it a fun film? Yes. Is it worth seeing? Yes. Is Cage good in it? Maybe, because little acting chops are needed. Then, again, that's the point of satire, to show that little effort is needed in mimicking the crap that passes for quality, in most instances. The DVD, put out by First Look Studios, shows the film in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and there are only a few DVD features. An audio commentary is not among them. This is a shame, for with a good prompter, Herzog is amongst the best film commentarians going. What we do get are two trailers for the film, photos from the shoot, by Herzog's wife, and a slapped together `Making Of' documentary that is not really a documentary, just captured footage. Peter Zeitlinger's cinematography is as good as it's always been, in these such films. The musical scoring, by Herzog and Mark Isham, is also good, and quite feral and raw. The focus on odd bits, such as breakdancing ghosts of dead mobsters, invisible iguanas on coffee tables, snakes that slither through flooded prisons, and an alligator that eyes its run over and dying mate from its own eye level, are just some of the odd views the film gives. Even the actors, in minor roles, don't really act, they just are, and become as iconographically symbolic as the animals.Yet, the film has power, because, as Serpico showed, there are few things more `real' in film than cops who abuse their power. Yes, Cage's Terry becomes almost clown-like, but the things he does are done every day, in every major police force, all around the world. The Blue Wall Of Silence protects the scumbags. Terry's is the Type 1 corrupt cop. They are up to 5 % of all cops. Type 2 is the cop who does not commit brazenly illegal acts, but writes false tickets to meet quotas, harasses drivers, and takes bribes (in the form of money or female's phone numbers) to drop charges against them. They are up to 80 % of the police force. Type 3 is the most prevalent corruption, and they are the 99+% of cops who look the other way at Types 1 and 2. (obviously there's overlap between the three types) So, claims that the film is not realistic are wrong; it's merely stylized realism. And, the film it actually shares the most, thematically, with is Curtis Hanson's 1997 masterpiece, L.A. Confidential, which also focuses on corrupt cops and an execution in a home. But Bad Lieutenant: Port Of Call: New Orleans really has only one kinship, and that's with the many oddball films in Herzog's own canon. My guess is that fictive masterpieces like he did in the first two decades of his career, are simply beyond Herzog now, and that the best we can get, not unlike Woody Allen, are flashes of brilliance, and the occasional mesmerizing small documentary. Good enough for most filmmakers, but coming from Herzog, it's hard to put aside the notion that his career could have been even more, could have transfigured the medium to an even greater degree. Nonetheless, films like this will suffice, just as they will entertain and dog the viewer with a mind demanding more than just the Hollywood formulae of yore. See it, and move somewards from your self. Watching Bad Lieutenant: Port Of Call: New Orleans, is there any reason not to?",

Hall, Shea Whigham and Michael ShannonWRITTEN BY: William M. Finkelstein; inspired by the previous film Bad Lieutenant, written by Victor Argo, Paul Calderon, Abel Ferrara and Zoe LundDIRECTED BY: Werner HerzogRated: RGenre: DramaRelease Date: 20 November 2009Nicolas Cage delivers his most daring performance since his Oscar winning role in Leaving Las Vegas. Much like his character in that film, Terence in The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, finds himself wondering down a dark path in a tornado of self destruction. He's a police officer who also happens to be a drug addict and a criminal.There is no one big case that Terence is assigned to in this film and that is due mainly to the film's setting: a post Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. Terence is a man who finds much to do with his new found freedom of working in the slums of a city brought nearly to its knees.He forces himself onto women, gambles heavily, he steals drugs from both drug dealers and evidence lockers - taking them while on duty, and he cheats on his prostitute of a girlfriend. Few actors could have taken a premise as disturbing as this and a character as twisted as Terence and made both not only tolerable but likeable. Cage is an actor more than capable.It's worth mentioning without disclosing in full detail, how good this film is at having us believe this man would be able to get away with these things. He is constantly on the verge of being found out, and yet somehow amidst his coked out madness, he is able to use his police detective wit to outsmart his counterparts and the criminals he comes into contact with who want him dead. Naturally this makes for good suspense and kept me intrigued throughout.The film is incredibly well written and directed and strewn with good supporting top-notch actors who include Eva Mendes, Val Kilmer, Xzibit, Brad Dourif, Jennifer Coolidge, Michael Shannon and Shawn Hatosy. Even so, it is not a film that will appeal to audiences in the masses, thus its limited theatrical release. But for any true Nic Cage fan or for anyone who can find the entertainment value in something so depressing and sinister, I can't recommend it more.",

As in many Herzog's movie, the final climax left the audience another metaphysical question: Was the final blowup a consequence of FATE, or the result of Cage's intelligent calculations admidst his painful and drug-induced high state?",

    "review/text": "While I'm not sure anything could equal Abel Ferrara's masterpiece \"Bad Lieutenant\" (and the viewer should not go into this movie expecting that), Herzog's \"Port of Call New Orleans\" is more than worth the time of those interested in seeing the offbeat director's skillful use of Nicolas Cage as Terence McDonaugh, a corrupt New Orleans detective with so many life threatening problems (drug addiction, gambling addiction, debt to mafioso) that the threat of immanent death is something that he's accustomed to.While none of this particularly shocked me (Nicolas Cage has talent but I could never buy him as a genuine tough guy), I found it hilarious, uncanny, and filled with mystery in a really strange way. In the same vein as Ferrara's tour de force--an absolute wretch looking for redemption or at least occasionally trying not to be a monster--and employing extreme surreality to a purpose. The love among the damned bit (Terence has a drug addict prostitute for a girlfriend who looks a little too good for her job, played by the gorgeous Eva Mendes) is not cliche and Herzog uses it to comical effect more than anything else. The sense of displacement and dislocation in Terence's narcotic addled, deranged psyche is used to maximum effect in bits of dialogue that are priceless. A mobster obviously modeled on the late John Gotti fondles his girlfriend, threatening him viciously, and then says: \"When one touches another physically it is a reminder, Terence, that we are not alone. Not completely.\"His anger at the elderly obviously has something to do with his reformed alcoholic father. The linear plot of the movie which is the least important aspect of the film is thus: Terence is enraged by the brutal gangland slaying of a family and a little girl over some money. He reads in the little girl's diary: \"When my fish sleeps, it dreams.\" This is a recurrent theme and sets him on an inner quest, when he isn't quaffing drugs from wayward youngsters at nightclubs. Because of the death of this child and her note he seeks to understand his own youth and come to terms with his almost certain death. He returns home to his father and searches for the spoon he once found as a child while looking for booty like a Pirate. He will \"sleep with the fishes\", yes, but will he dream? Will there be any innocence or purity left in his wretched life?The way he apprehends those responsible for the family's death is so confusing that occasionally the viewer wonders whether he has become entirely depraved. But no, his \"lucky crackpipe\" saves the day. Is his success at the end a dream? Did he actually die? Did the man he saved at the beginning get him help, or are they both \"sleeping like the fishes\" in the closing sequence?Brad Dourif plays a low level loan shark for the mob, but he is really Terence's priest. He urges Terence to do something to save himself and echoes with his own performance the Catholicism of Ferrara's film. Val Kilmer is hilarious as his partner who is just a guy's guy and wants to help out his friend at any cost, but is also badly influenced by him. A quirky gem, cult classic at the least.",

    "review/summary": "Werner Herzog's latest hypnotic and strange portrait of a man on the edge",
    "review/text": "Visionary filmmaker Werner Herzog and Nicholas Cage take on what looks like an ordinary police procedural and turn it into something nearly as hypnotic and strange as the megalomaniacal meltdown of the conquistador played by Klaus Kinski inAguirre, the Wrath of God. A recurrent theme of Herzog's work is the breakdown of social norms under extreme conditions, of war or conflict or survival. Or you might say he's interested in the ways we manage to maintain a paradoxical commitment to ceremony and convention even in extreme situations where the realities that support them and the ideals they are supposed to sustain have broken down.Cage plays a New Orleans police detective, promoted to Lieutenant after a reluctant act of bravery caused him to be injured on the job in the aftermath of Katrina. His resultant back pains help explain his addiction to pain pills and other illegal \"medications,\" but it is the paradoxical atmosphere of general permissiveness and tolerance of eccentricity combined with strict regulations that seems to push him over the edge and out of control. The style of the film likewise alternates between fairly conventional police drama and the over-the-top extreme of drug-addled subjectivity.Break dancing souls, hallucinatory iquanas, grieving alligators. What do fish dream of, anyhow? An always intriguing, darkly comic (indeed, often bizarrely hilarious) and strange film. Must see for fans of Herzog and of visionary cinema that pushes against the boundaries of the conventional and familiar. I'd say, also, that anyone who lovesBreaking Badis likely to dig the humor and off-kilter vibe of Herzog's Bad Lieutenant. Generally speaking, though, fans of Nick Cage's more popular fare would do best to avoid this unless they know what they're getting into. He's shown an ability to go unhinged and on the edge before (e.g.Wild at HeartorAdaptationorLeaving Las Vegas), but his performance here reaches new depths of depravity and darkness.",

    "review/text": "I found this film to be highly entertaining. Never a dull moment. Nicolas Cage presented a bravura performance as New Orleans Police Lieutenant Terence McDonagh. McDonagh is bad in every sense of the word. He's addicted to prescription pain killers, heavily uses crack, cocaine, and heroin, steals drugs from the police property room, builds up huge debts due to binge gambling, and seems to have the morality of an alley cat. He lies like the proverbial rug. Indeed, he lies like a carpet factory. He ends up working for drug dealers to get the drugs he needs and the cash he needs to pay off his gambling debts.And he goes around with a gun stuck in the middle of his belt that looks like it was ripped off the deck of the U.S.S. Constitution.Yes, the lieutenant is bad and he's out of control. Cage put a lot into projecting this image.One weakness of the movie was the turn it took at the end. I don't want to spoil it by saying any more. Another weakness is the limited role of Val Kilmer. His excellent acting skills could have been put to better use.A major strength of the film was the stunning Eva Mendes, who portrayed McDonagh's girlfriend",

    "review/text": "After what seems like decades of poor career choices, Nicholas Cage isfinally back at the top of his game in \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of CallNew Orleans,\" a film that reminds us of just how fine an actor the man can be when hehas material worthy of his talents.In this \"loose\" follow-up to the 1992 film \"Bad Lieutenant,\" Cage playsTerence McDonaugh, a homicide detective whose chronic back pain hasturned him into a veritable coke fiend, and whose penchant for gamblingand consorting with prostitutes makes him less than ideal law enforcermaterial. Yet, despite his moral shortcomings, McDonaugh is a crackinvestigator who's currently working on a case involving the brutalslaying of a heroin dealer and his family of Senegalese immigrants.In its willingness to take its time laying out its storyline andsoaking in the rich details of its social milieu and physical setting,\"Bad Lieutenant\" has more in common with dense TV dramas like \"TheShield\" and \"The Wire\" than it does with slicker police proceduralsaimed at a mainstream movie audience. Beyond Cage, who makes us feelevery twinge - physical or otherwise - that the character is goingthrough, there is excellent supporting work from Eva Mendes, Tom Bowerand Jennifer Coolidge, among others, though Val Kilmer isunder-utilized as his crime-fighting partner.Director Werner Herzog adds a number of offbeat \"artistic\" touches -some involving indigenous fauna like alligators and iguanas - toheighten the somewhat surrealistic nature of the piece, whichaccurately reflects McDonaugh's increasingly altered state ofconsciousness. Despite the murder mystery scenario that serves as itsengine, the screenplay by William Finkelstein frequently takes detoursaround the main story, more concerned with exploring character andsetting than with providing a linear, action-packed narrative. And it's also wickedly funny. In fact, the more emotionally and psychologically unhinged McDonaugh becomesthroughout the course of the story, the more the black humor quotientrises up to meet him.Cage, showing his confidence as an actor, is not afraid to push theenvelope in his performance, often ratcheting it up a notch or two toconvey McDonaugh's disordered state. The movie also hints at how rifewith corruption much of the reconstruction effort in the wake ofHurricane Katrina has become, with unscrupulous types looking to make aquick buck off the vulnerable and desperate citizens who still livethere.",

    "review/text": "In Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, Nicholas Cage plays a quintessential Cage character as the self-destructive coke-head Terence McDonagh. His investigation into the drug related murder of an entire family and his need to fuel his habit takes him into some odd places, his path crossing those of even odder characters. And iguanas. The supporting cast supplies familiar faces and the secondary plots that converge into the surprising and gleeful conclusion.McDonagh's plummet to rock bottom during the dark and sordid first half of this movie is difficult to watch, but is the necessary set up for the astonishing events of the second. Val Kilmer, Jennifer Coolidge, Brad Dourif and Eva Mendes turn in fine performances as the secondary characters fueling McDonagh's quandaries and dilemmas. As McDonagh's character is further revealed, we see that he's more than the first half would indicate and some very dark humor begins to surface.I've been struggling with what to say about Bad Lieutenant. Describing it as Robert Altman making a movie with the Coen brothers gives a sense of its surreal noir-ness, but isn't fair to Mr. Herzog. I wouldn't describe this as a fun movie, or even a pleasant one, and inside Herzog's head is an interesting place to be if you don't have to spend a lot of time there. If you can make it through the dancing soul, it's worth sticking with this movie to the end, though not everyone will want to. Three and a half stars, rounded up to four.",

    "review/text": "I liked this more than I expected. I generally think Cage is one of the most overrated actors out there, but he kept me interested here, and has moments of near genius. Herzog likewise; he slips a few times but all in all this feels like a good Hollywood crime flick that goes off the rails time and again into a weird zone all its own.There is a massive amount of overt coke use here without the usual celluloid sanitization, and it's a pretty accurate depiction of what a dick that crap usually turns people into. The worst parts are the overlong lizard hallucinations, but then again the best are nearby, when Cage smokes crack and freaks out. He is verrry convincing in those, well able to really let go into briefly psychotic mania, making one wonder how much rock ol' Nick incinerated during the years of his excesses. Those scenes are completely gripping in their intense weirdness, and the black gang members are all very solid and convincing. Whatever plot holes are here, and there are a few, get steamrolled by the intensity of the best scenes.In fact most of the acting here is above average, and except for a few moments of lame dialogue this movie has a raw, real feel that truly does smell like Nawlins, in all its tragic beauty and grime.While no masterpiece, Bad Looey has enough positives and unique vibe to make it well worth watching for fans of Cage, Herzog, The Big Not-So-Easy, bizarre edginess, or cop flicks in general.",

He roams New Orleans basically free, wielding badge and gun (.44 magnum that he tucks in his belt)and steals from junkies, or he is taking drugs from the police evidence room. He plays the role on such a fine line where it doesn't seem he is \"over acting\" or being over the top, a perfect performance, as he tries to solve a murder of a family and bring in a suspected drug king pin played by Xzibit. We see McDonagh go through police procedures all while coked up. Unlike Keitel he isn't an amoral cop, he is smart and believe it or not does seem to have some morals somewhere in his soul. McDonagh is a street wise, smart, crooked, junkie cop, he's in his own surreal world.He plays the tormented cop very well, always on edge, off kilter, then has some somber moments, again great acting performance by Cage.Herzog's direction here is great, some will argue basically nothing is happening in this movie, no violence, we watch Cage solving this murder, going from Point A to Point B. Herzog's direction is tight, and the way he lets some scenes linger on a crocodile and the iguanas it was weird, and yet surreal, almost as if we now see what McDonagh is going through while all doped up and working.I felt the original was awesome, a masterful movie but yet so dark, so sad, but unflinching, and depressing, this Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans didn't leave me with that feeling, it was Cage's performance that hooked me and had me laughing at some of the crazy scenes. If anything worth checking out for Cage's performance",

That aside, he was severely miscast in the lead role as a 'bad' guy or a 'lieutenant' He's the same loser from MoonStruck, who never grew up. In this flick, he whined out his lines from a pathetically cliched script. He's not scary, he's not the right size physically, his clothes don't fit and he's asleep through most of the film. He's just not tough guy material. He's a kid.The acting was uniformly dull. Val Kilmer didn't have an identifiable role nor did he have a thing to do with moving the so-called story along. Many scenes looked like the actors were playing pretend and making up their lines on the spot with an amateurish enthusiasm. Werner Herzog made this piece B- movie? That's a shame, for him.I guess the production couldn't afford an editor to cut the many superfluous scenes in which the characters verbally updated us on the plot in slow motion. Everyone in the movie must have been whoring for their SAG cards. The only interesting feature was seeing Jennifer Coolidge in a serious part, though her stereotyped role was complete after only one scene. Thereafter, she was a rerun serving no purpose whatsoever to the plot. The story was cobbled together unrealistically enough to make sure the viewer didn't give a damn about any characters by the time the irrelevant and stupidly lingering aquarium scene finally goes black at the end. ZZZZZzzzzzzzzz.I'm surprised this flim was released, even if it had only gone directly to DVD. It's that bad. Don't bother with this movie. Those who made it didn't.",

We see him doing things like sticking up club patrons for their drugs and then taking them and snorting them up himself.3. He has a hooker girlfriend who is mistreated by a John (she snorts almost as much dope as he does), and to whose rescue Bad Lieutenant comes-- but at the price of upsetting a group of small time mobsters that hold him responsible for $50,000.4. There is also a murder of a family of Haitians that needs to be resolved (this is actually what starts the film).5. The cop finds a Witness To The Murder, who is afraid to testify lest he be killed. The people who were murdered were also affiliated with drug dealers, who left no evidence.6. Witness to the Murder disappears, but we later find out that he has gone to England-- but this is only after this drug crazed cop pulls a gun on an old woman in a wheelchair to extract a confession.7. Eventually, the cop strikes a deal with a Big Drug Dealer for protection in exchange for cash and dope.8. Just as this deal is being clinched, mobsters-to-whom-Bad-Lieutenant-owes-money walk in to collect their money (and foolishly decide to rob the Big Drug Dealer at the same time).9. The Big Drug Dealer and cop kill them all and this creates enough evidence for the cop to plant at the murder scene to indict the Big Drug Dealer who murdered the family.10. Aftermath: Cop takes hooker out of business and has a baby with her, but is later seen sticking up bar patrons for drugs again. The end.Comments:This film was OK (I mean, if someone paid to have Nicholas Cage act in a film, there is a limit to how bad that film could be-- at least theoretically). Nicholas Cage really did make me believe that I was looking at a coke-head cop.To me, this is worth a matinee movie ticket or maybe (possibly) even a rental off the New Release shelf. It's certainly entertaining, though a bit implausible in some aspects.",

The acting is good enough, but the story lacks inspiration and therefore believability. Cage and Mendes are captivating when the writing allows. For example, the scenes where Cage strongarms the john in the hotel room, or the young users in the parking lot, fall flat because Cage and the writers can't put together believable storytelling. Cage shines in scenes where he really lets loose, like in the pharmacy scene or his car ride scene with his new business partners, and exhibits his eccentric force.Xzibit is as good as ever, and Val Kilmer reaffirms that the level of his talent is such that he will shine in any role. Kilmer seems to be like Ray Liotta, in that their apparent drive to work seems to land them in movies that are beneath them, but then again, that's not uncommon - Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken.This movie is little more than a moderately interesting and propagandized indictment of police authority, and unfortunately, the original was much better with a better lead performance and more memorable scenes.",

The story moves at a choreographic cadence like a dance whose frenzy is resolved not by the antihero's doubly heroic actions, but by fate that smiles on the good and bad with the same beneficence. The film moves from one convoluted relationship to another continually tightening the tension being lubricated with dark humor and surreal visions fitting comfortably with \"single purpose\". Herzog carries the audience to agree with the action through the use of our sympathy and horrific events. We empathize with the monster because we know he is us were we him. Through the fear we find humanity surfacing to bring redemption.",

He is so over the top and frankly just hilarious. I could not quit laughing after some scenes. When the camera moves off-topic a bit and has its little sideshows it was also hilarious.Someone else said the story in this movie does not really matter, and I believe that is true. Cage's various scenes are so good they could each stand on their own.I'm the type of person who can laugh at anything funny, no matter how dark, if you are not like that this it is not for you.

    "review/text": "I was surprised that my theater actually got this movie today. It doesn't seem to be getting much play around the country and will likely hit DVD before most people can witness this strange little gem. I read some really positive reviews from critics and movie watchers alike, so I figured I would give it a shot. I haven't been a fan of Nicolas Cage for a long time, mainly because he seems to be taking every bad movie and turning in a subpar performance. Now that we know he has money problems in real life, it at least makes sense now. I'm happy to say the he is back in top form here. His character is as bad as Denzel Washington's in Training Day and he is played in the same over the top way, without seeming to be unbelievable. He has a hunched back and carries his .44 magnum in the front of his pants wherever he goes. Most of the characters in Bad Lieutenant are predictable scum, but Cage throws so much into this performance that you really have no clue what's going to happen from one scene to the next. He is at his crazy best here and reminded me that few people can play weird as well as this man. Eva Mendes is looking pretty good here and her acting is decent, but her role doesn't amount to much other than a slight bright spot for Cage's loose cannon. Val Kilmer shows up and is quite good, but he is barely in the movie. Maybe five minutes tops.On the negative side, this film is very dark and often mean, but thankfully some humor forces it's way through in some of these scenes. There are also some bizarre visuals, such as a point of view shot from an alligator and another from a couple of iguanas for no reason at all. A few scenes also linger on a bit to long and the pacing slows at times, but I was sucked into this corrupt man's life and couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Welcome back Mr. Nicolas Cage of old and don't go anywhere this time around.",

In this film Cage does what he does he does best: acts completely crazy. This is also a very adult themed film full of racy content. If that is your interest you will feel right at home here. Cage is so unpredictable in this film you could probably watch it five times and not be totally sure what he is going to do next. The story is the standard. The action is excellent. It is also completely necessary to mention this film is directed by Werner Herzog. A director whose vision really gives Cage the ability to reach the outer orbits of insanity. Watch with care. Overall Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans brings a little welcomed danger back to the screen. Great appearances by Brad Dourif and Eva Mendes. Also be on the lookout because strange things happen with no explanation. Stay tuned.Its amazing how much you can get done when you have a simple purpose in life.",

    "review/text": "I didn't really know what to expect when I popped this into my DVD player. The reviews on the original theatrical release were all over the place. Add to that the New Orleans setting as opposed to the New York setting. Werner Herzog as opposed to Abel Ferrara. Nick Cage as opposed to Harvey Keitel. I suppose it's amazing this ever got made to begin with.That being said I approached it with an open mind and I'm still not certain what to think. It wasn't bad by any means but it was weird. It rather follows the original in that you have a cop gone bad who has problems with drugs and gambling and uses his position to shake down bad guys to help feed his bad habits. But here you see that Cage is good guy down deep. He saves a trapped prisoner from drowning in a cell in the aftermath of Katrina and seems genuinely wanting to solve a mass execution style murder. He also has an \"escort\" girlfriend to whom he supplies drugs but who he also defends when trouble knocks.Anyway........the hole gets deeper and deeper and you know things are going to come to a nasty head as he struggles to develop a scheme to right the entire mess. I can't spoil what happens but let it be said this takes one of the most peculiar turns I've ever seen in a movie. And what happens seems to be real and not just Cage's pipe dream.I guess this threw me to the point having to ask myself what Herzog was trying to say. I'm certain there must be some subtext I missed or something, but it seemed to revolve around Kharma, (I suppose).Anyway.....All the aspects of the film are professional. The acting is good (though I do wish Eva Mendez had a bit more to do) and all the cinematography, edittng, music score, etc., are all good. And though it is 2 hours long, I didn't find myself looking at my watch so there's something to be said on that note.So.....I suppose I'm on the fence but leaning to the \"liking it\" side. Maybe it shouldn't be the top of your rental list, but don't be afraid of it either. Maybe it hasn't given up all it's charms yet and one or two more viewings might help me \"get it.\"",

Werner Herzog claims to have never seen this film.Controversies aside, Bad Lieutenant delivers.In my opinion, there are four factors that make the film outstanding, Nicolas Cage, Werner Herzog the director, the script and the city of New Orleans.Nicholas Cage delivers a flawless performance as the pain riddled, drug addicted, corrupt cop who is completely out of control. His performance will reaffirm the faith of his old fans while drawing new ones. His awkward walk because of crippling back pain, his tone of voice and his dialogue delivery is superb. Kudos. He plays Terrence Mcdonagh and is investigating the murders of an entire Senegalese family. His girl friend is played by Eva Mendes and she is fair. Val Kilmer plays his co-worker and is relegated to a five minute cameo, hey what happened to this once A-lister. All the supporting characters have interesting story lines and they make this movie complete and worth watching. I really enjoyed this film, five stars 04/06/10",

Before that there was a long break and I remember weird stuff with Klaus Kinski (Fitzcarraldo; Aguirre; Ouida), and wasn't there a Kaspar Hauser version?Anyway, the man is rather crazy, and this film with the crazy Mr.Cage stays true to form. Superficially a cop story set in post Katrina New Orleans, we might retell it as if it was a straightforward one: a police sergeant gets promoted to lieutenant for valiant actions during Katrina, which also caused him back problems and drug addictions. At the end he gets promoted some more. In the meantime he chases killers and drug dealers and at the same time he uses his cop power to steal drugs from his `customers' as well as from the police storage room. He is indebted to bookies and he shares his consumption habits with his girlfriend who spends her own working life in the meat trade. His father is an ex cop and AA activist, his stepmother an unabashed beer drinker. Such a happy family of addicts!Cage's character's luck seems to turn on him when he faces two short term payment demands, one of them from a gang of very violent men. He also seems to run into trouble, at last, with his employer, after running into the wrong targets for his own bullying on the job. It is not a good idea to antagonize people with connections.But don't expect Herzog to stay within the rules of realistic narration. There are scenes of outright weirdness, often involving animals. The camera once follows the world with the eyes of an alligator, or rather the camera is mounted on the gator's head. Or Cage, most of the time high, sees iguanas in his room, where nobody else sees anything. That is, we see them of course. Or a man needs to be shot twice, since his soul will not stop breakdancing after the first shooting.The plot line is also not exactly strictly logical. One has the impression that Herzog suddenly gets impatient with the direction of the plot and he screws up conventional logic to turn the story into some kind of surrealistic comedy.My personal opinion on him: he is just an eccentric with technical and artistic skills. Don't even try to see anything deeper in his products. They are exotic, and that is a value in itself.",

    "review/text": "My back hurt after watching this movie; my neck, too. I won't tell you why, but you'll know soon enough if you give this sleeper of a movie a chance and watch Nicholas Cage do his acting thing in the Bad Lieutenant. Many people love him or hate him, but given the right material and the freedom to create, he can indeed surprise. I think he had a hand in inventing this role and maybe the director gave him a lot of leeway; because his character dominates every frame of this movie.And there's more good news. It's a taught and suspenseful thriller for those of you who love the crime, suspense and murder genre. Here we have to give Herzog accolades, the director, for choosing the setting (New Orleans), the music and the scenes. Certainly a bizarre thinker himself based on some of his other films. But in Bad he has woven together a frightening dilemma for our hero. Now that I think about it, we don't care too much about Cage, but we do care about those that surround him. That's a peculiarity, maybe a weakness of the story; why people like him. But some do and in the end I do, too. He's not a very likable sort at all and that's an understatement, but he is startling and hysterical; a dark, cheerless barrel of monkeys when he is high. You won't want to meet him otherwise.So, that's good news for many of you Californians, who love some of the weed. There is much in this story for you to rejoice in and relate to as it examines, fictionally perhaps, the underbelly of the use and abuse of recreational and pharmaceutical drugs in a hopelessly desolate city. I don't think the New Orleans Visitors Bureau woud approve of Herzog's depiction of their city. Though he does it artfully.I looked into this movie because Ebert gave it high marks. I might have ignored it because of Cage otherwise. He can be too `cagey' in films, especially in recent action-type flicks. But he is great in this one, over the top, as they say. The other characters are acted wonderfully and are as lovable as new born puppies - just kidding. You will find most of them repulsive and comical and you'll love to hate them. I think Herzog is a `bad director'. You'll know why I used parentheses after you watch.",

Not really no, as Werner Herzog's The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans is a different sort of film than Abel Ferrara's early 90s Harvey Keitel-starring tale of corruption and redemption. Nicolas Cage, giving the best performance he's given in years, stars as Terrence McDonagh; a drug-raddled, painkiller-addicted, gambling junkie New Orleans police lieutenant with a prostitute girlfriend (Eva Mendes) and a very bad back. While investigating the murders of a family of Senegalese immigrants in this post-Katrina landscape, all fingers point to a local drug lord (Xzibit), who may prove to be untouchable. While Herzog's film may definitely not be for all tastes, the main attraction here is Cage by and far. After a string of stinkers like Ghost Rider, Next, and Bangkok Dangerous among others; Bad Lieutenant re-affirms just how spectacular an actor that he can in fact be. Regardless of whether or not you are a fan of Herzog, Cage's performance is reason enough to see this film. By the time the credits roll, you'll be wondering too if fish have dreams.",

So don't expect car action or shoot-outs. What you get here is an anti-hero Terence McDonagh and he is a complicated character, a law-breaking cop addicted to illegal drug and gambling, but tries to protect Frankie (Eva Mendes), a prostitute and his girlfriend from violence. Cage's over-the-top acting style is perfect for the role, and some scenes are darkly funny.Supporting actors are all very good, and Alvin \"Xzibit\" Joiner is impressive as \"Big Fate,\" but Val Kilmer doesn't have much to do, especially in the second half of the film.We should not consider the 2009 crime drama as sequel or remake of the 1992 cult film \"Bad Lieutenant\" (starring Harvey Keitel and directed by Abel Ferrara). Religious overtone in Abel Ferrara version is mostly removed. The setting is changed from New York to New Orleans and Werner Herzog shoots the city in the most unflattering way. He never misses a chance to show the contrast between the haves and the have-nots, and he does it blatantly. It often looks as if the \"Fitzcarraldo\" director follows where his instinct leads. MacDonagh's back pain is forgotten in the second half. There are bizarre alligator and iguana sequences and a dancing soul that is certainly unique. Give it a try.",

    "review/text": "I went into this not having read too much about it really, and not knowing just how much it had to do with Abel Ferrara's 1992 film-with-part-of-the-same name. I loved that film when it came out, and probably ought to revisit it, but in the meantime this Werner Herzog \"re-imagining\" or whatever one wants to call it isn't half-bad in it's own right, though I'm not entirely sure if it's really special either. Not an easy film to get to the heart of after just one viewing, but I'll give it a try.The basic plot does mirror the earlier film in its essentials - an (apparently) once-good cop (nameless, and inhabited with ferocious anguish by Harvey Keitel in the earlier film) spirals downward over the course of a few days due to drug addiction, gambling debts, obsessions with women and allowing all of this personal stuff to get in the way of a difficult murder/drug case. But whereas the earlier film had an awful lot of Christian symbolism and was fairly obviously the work of someone with a difficult relationship with Catholicism, Werner Herzog's film eschews religion, and also humanizes Lt Terrence McDonagh (Nicolas Cage), giving him not only a name but (possibly) a rationale for his behavior, which may feel more realistic but is also, ultimately, a bit problematic. Herzog as always is more interested in man's relationship with his environment and his obsessions than with his faith.At the beginning of the film McDonagh and his partner Stevie (Val Kilmer) are searching a jail in the aftermath of Katrina. They're doing a lot of joking, and McDonagh grabs a fellow cop's dirty pictures, but nothing seems really out of place. Then they come across a prisoner locked in a cage that is slowly flooding. They laugh and joke about it and seem as if they're just going to let the guy drown, but then McDonagh jumps in to save him. Cut to a few months later - McDonagh is on heavy doses of vicodin for a back injury he suffered in the rescue, has been promoted to Lieutenant, and is also a heavy user of coke and is involved with high-priced hooker Frankie (Eva Mendes). The thing that's interesting is that we don't know - never know - how much of his current situation is due to the injury, because we only get a couple of minutes of the backstory. How far along was he in this downward spiral? How much of it is, in fact, due to an act of heroism?Soon McDonagh gets put on a quintuple-homicide case that involves drugs, and he's up to his neck both investigating what's going on and trying to make a buck off of it. Because he's also a gambler you see, and in deep; and he also manages to make an enemy of one of his girlfriend's customers early on who happens to have connections. More drugs, more threats of violence, and eventually a partnership with one of the dealers...it looks as if McDonagh's days are numbered, and as his life begins to deteriorate, so too his body and mind seem to start falling apart.Then the film starts to change direction, subtly at first and then in the last 20 minutes or so more obviously (which I won't spoil for you), and heads away to some extent from the gritty \"realism\" which seemed to be its focus earlier on. It's all quite ambivalent and murky in the final analysis, which was probably deliberate but which doesn't entirely work given the single-minded negative direction Cage's character and the film goes in for such a long stretch; if like me you are taking it as a realistic portrait at the beginning, it may be hard to accept the growing fantasy world that it seems to grow into. And though I don't usually mind being in the company of unpleasant people, in this case it does become a bit wearing, as the film is basically full of nothing but low-lives, from the cops to the dealers and everybody in between. The film definitely felt a little longer than it needed to be - I think we got both the message (if there is one) and enough incident to keep us entertained by the hour and a half mark; the rest seems a bit repetitious and sometimes silly.But then...there is Cage, who manages the physical and even the vocal mannerisms of someone wearing down day by day through drugs and stress and fear quite effectively. I'm sure a lot of people are saying this is his best performance in years - not having seen very much of the films he's been making in the past 10-15 years I'll take their word for it, but it's certainly pretty impressive. I thought his speech pattern, which changes markedly over the course of the film, rather strange - but again, I think that at the end, it's become a different sort of nightmare, a different kind of vision of hell or heaven or...something...and Cage has changed with it.It's also rather odd that nobody in the film sounds particularly like they're from New Orleans - if you look down the cast list, nobody in the top dozen or so credited is from the area, and only a couple are from the south at all. When you realize this, and when you see where the film goes ultimately, you have to assume that realism was just about the last thing on Herzog's mind. Sure, the movie was filmed in NOLA and nearby areas, but the seedy atmosphere of the whole thing could be replicated anywhere, and apart from the bookending references to the hurricane, it doesn't much matter. Which makes the subtitle \"Port of Call New Orleans\" every bit as oblique as the whole film ultimately ends up being.I have the feeling this could easily improve a lot on a subsequent viewing. Perhaps in this case, having some idea of the direction the film and it's main character are heading in might make it more cohesive and meaningful. At the moment, in any case, this BAD LIEUTENANT is one of the harder-to-rate films I've seen lately; Cage's performance, and the entertainment value of the film, keep it positive, and that's where it'll likely remain pending another viewing.And you'll just have to see the film yourself to know what my title means!",

It baffles me that an actor of his caliber who does two or three film a year can't manage his funds. This movie is a weird one. Herzog was goin for a Fear and Loathing vibe but I wasn't feeling it. Cage's character is a PD Lieutenant who is addicted to drugs. He steals, gambles, and hustles people like he's a Tijuana cop. In reality no one that messed up would be a police detective. The movie has a very thin plot. It involves murders, witnesses, a hooker girlfriend, drug dealers, mobsters, bookies ect. There's appearences by Val Kilmer, Eva Mendez, Xzibit, and a couple other familiar actors. This is just another of the many mediocre post Katrina New Orleans films. The only good one I can think of is \"Deja Vu\" with Denzel and Val Kilmer. (who also did the one with 50 cent). He must live in New Orleans. I reccomend this as a rental. That's if you can tolerate watching constant drug use. If you're a fan of Nick Cage and drugs then knock yourself out. Oh yeah, Cage looks ridiculous walking around with his pistol stuck in the front of his pants the entire movie.",

    "review/text": "*** This review may contain spoilers ***The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans is the updated version of the original Bad Lieutenant, starring Harvey Keitel, which debuted in 1992. This one is directed by German Director Werner Herzog, well known in the 70s and 80s for such classics as Aguirre - The Wrath of God. Where the original Bad Lieutenant was a grim, unpleasant little film which attempted to emulate the early Martin Scorsese (featuring an unlikeable protagonist in the title role), Herzog opts to play his Bad Lieutenant for laughs. As a result, while not a particularly noteworthy film, the new incarnation is vastly more entertaining than the original.Despite the outrageous, over-the-top performance, Nicolas Cage's Bad Lieutenant is far more likable than Keitel's surly cop. Yes, they both have terrible drug habits but Cage's Terence McDonagh has traits the audience can identify with: devotion to a woman (albeit his prostitute girlfriend), love of animals (he attempts to find a new home for his father's dog), respect for a parent (he always shows concern for his father and tries to help him) and commitment to finishing a job (despite being sidetracked, McDonagh eventually does catch the murderer).In the 1992 version, we cringe when Keitel's Bad Lieutenant rips off an innocent store owner after menacing a couple of punks. But when McDonagh steps over the line, his victims are not completely innocent. Thus Herzog manages to mitigate the Bad Lieutenant's cruelty. For example, when McDonagh frisks the young couple who have just come out of the club and tries to extort them, the young man IS guilty of drug possession (and his female victim isn't scared of being victimized; she willingly participates in having sex with McDonagh). Later, when McDonagh rips the breathing tube from the elderly woman, his 'cowboy' tactics aren't completely vile since he is attempting to extract information on the whereabouts of a teenage murder witness from the boy's grandmother who at first refuses to cooperate.Another advantage the new version has over the old, is that 'Port of Call' actually has something of a plot. When we first meet the Bad Lieutenant, he's saving a prisoner from drowning inside a New Orleans jail cell as the Katrina flood waters rise. While McDonagh acts out of complete self-interest (it leads to his promotion), the act of saving the prisoner is McDonagh's 'save the cat' moment (the necessary moment during the first five pages of a screenplay, in which the late screen writing guru, Blake Snyder, holds that the protagonist must do something positive for the audience to like him for the rest of the film).'Port of Call' proceeds smartly during the first half of the second act as McDonagh is hot on the trail of the man who murdered five Sengalese family members in a run down section of New Orleans. There are a few good scenes where two suspects are brought in and interrogated and later when McDonagh, who has been protecting the only witness to the killings, a fifteen year old boy, loses him after he goes off to snort some drugs for a few minutes (the boy flees to England and the case against the prime suspect, Big Fate, a local drug dealer, collapses.) In the second half of act two, the plot becomes much more convoluted. McDonagh threatens one of his girlfriend's customers, a son of a well-connected developer, who has ties to the mob. The mobsters get wind of McDonagh's boorish behavior and patronize his prostitute girlfriend. When McDonagh walks in on them, instead of paying the $10,000 fee for the girlfriend's services , they demand $50,000 as payback for the humiliation the Bad Lieutenant inflicted on the developer's son. To make matters worse, McDonagh's owes thousands to his bookie after losing numerous bets on college football games. McDonagh seeks out a star player on a local football team and threatens to arrest him for marijuana possession unless he agrees to throw the game so the Bad Lieutenant can cover the point spread.'Port of Call', which in the first half of the movie, appeared to be developing into a smart police procedural, opts for the easy denouement. McDonagh is stripped of his gun after complaints from the breathing tube lady and the developer's son bring out the police public integrity squad (in the original Bad Lieutenant, Harvey Keitel is never subject to the scrutiny of internal affairs). McDonagh contacts Big Fate and somehow convinces him to pay him the $15,000 he owes to his bookie in exchange for providing tips as to when the police might be impinging on the drug dealer's territory. In the most ludicrous scene in the film, the mobsters somehow march into Big Fate's house and they are conveniently dispatched by Big Fate and his bodyguards as McDonagh watches on, in a drug induced stupor (during this scene, McDonagh orders Big Fate to shoot the chief mobster again since his 'soul is still dancing'; out of the blue, we actually see the 'soul dancer' dancing before the mobster is finished off--undoubtedly a figment of McDonagh's drug-addled imagination).Through a stroke of great luck, McDonagh still manges to cover the point spread even though the football player he extorted, sits on the sidelines. True to form, McDonagh plants a crack pipe with Big Fate's DNA on it at the murder scene, and the murderer is brought to justice.You'll never see Nicholas Cage looking as bad as he does here in this film. It's intentional however, since everything is supposed to be completely over the top. Herzog scores no points for allowing boom microphones to unintentionally appear during the filming of various scenes (I counted at least six, possible seven instances of this occurring). Bad Lieutenant is fairly entertaining but is often silly to the point where it's impossible to take it seriously. I will not give away the bit about the Iguana; you have to see that for yourself!",

    "review/text": "The preview I saw made this movie look similar to Denzel's \"Training Days\" except with Cage playing something close to his character from \"Leaving Las Vegas\" (replace booze with drugs, of course). This couldn't be further from the truth. There was absolutely nothing redeeming here (bad writing, amateurish directing and camera work, no atmosphere to the film even though it was filmed in post-Katrina N.O., etc.). The acting (by EVERYONE) was forced and uninspired. The dialogue in many scenes had to have been ad libbed because you could actually see it in the actors' faces when they were waiting on the other actors in the scene to finish.The worst atrocity was when Cage's accent changes at about the 1:03 mark. He starts off sounding like typical Cage, but then his voice suddenly starts sounding like the love-child of Jimmy Stewart and Edward G. Robinson (you think I'm joking...I wish I were). This lasts about 30 min before he goes back to normal Cage.I like Cage (and many of his flicks) so I feel bad for his current financial woes, but I'd rather simply mail him a check than pay to watch him ruin his legacy by making tripe like this movie. This movie was Cage's 'Jar-Jar-Binks'...I hope there won't be another.And for the record, the best 'crooked-crazy-drugged-out-cop' character was played by Gary Oldman in \"The Professional\" (aka \"Leon\").",

Mr. Cage's character grew up in the south, shouldn't he (and just about everyone else) have had a southern accent? As Mr. Cage is a superb actor, perhaps it was the editing? I was left feeling that if Val Kilmer had been the leading actor that this film would have rocked. Mr. Kilmer never leaves me feeling that he is an actor playing a part, rather I feel he was the person whose story I was watching. Also, the ever-so-nice ending was not quite believeable. Given the harsh nature of the entire film, it felt out of place. I appreciated the work that went into this movie as the scenery felt real rather than contrived and there were no terrible night scenes where I was straining to see the actors. Thank you",

    "review/summary": "A criminally overlooked film and one of Cage's best",
    "review/text": "It's nearly impossible to review a movie like this. In fact, it's highly unlikely that there has ever been another movie \"like this\". Simply put, Werner Herzog and Nicolas Cage have created one of the most bizarre films I have ever seen. This assessment is only strengthened upon the realization that Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans (for the purposes of this review I will just call it Bad Lieutenant) tells no real story, at least not the kind of story that people expect when they, you know, watch a movie with a plot and actors and everything else.First off I must warn you not to confuse this with Abel Ferrera's Bad Lieutenant, a dark and disturbing portrait of one man's downward spiral and quest for redemption. Harvey Keitel was absolutely riveting in the role and to this day, Bad Lieutenant stands as one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. A straight remake would have been an impossible task and luckily this new Bad Lieutenant shares only the most basic premise with its older cousin. Where as Ferrera's film chronicled one man's descent into hell and was about as pleasant as it sounds, Herzog's film is a zany, manic, and oftentimes hilarious cop drama/black comedy/police procedural. The two films really could not be anymore different -- the only reason they share a name is due to a producer tied to both projects. In case I haven't made it clear enough -- comparing the two films is pointless and should not be attempted.Nicolas Cage plays a, wait for it ... bad lieutenant in post-Katrina New Orleans. When we first meet him he is debating the merits of saving a drowning prisoner with his psychotic partner, played by Val Kilmer, who manages to make an impression in his brief amount of screen time. Against his partner's recommendation, Lt. McDonagh (for that is the bad lieutenant's name) jumps into the flood waters and saves the man. When we next see him six months later, he is a literal wreck, suffering from constant back pain due to the rescue attempt, and is addicted to seemingly every substance on earth. Cage has a ball with the character and Herzog allows all of the usual Cage quirks and idiosyncrasies to shine, resulting in one of the most bizarre characters and performances in recent memory. Cage stalks around New Orleans, one shoulder held contorted above the other due to the back pain, his eyes practically popping out of his head, all with a .44 Magnum stuck in his waistband. This is a man with a lucky crack pipe who spouts hip hop non-sequiters at random (\"Til the break a dawn! Til the break a dawn!\") and frequently hallucinates that he is surrounded by iguanas. It is a thoroughly engrossing character, similar to a freak show member in a carnival, in that try as you might, you simply can't look away. The film's plot, if you could call it that, doesn't really warrant a discussion. This is not because the plot is terrible (it isn't), but because if you focus on the plot and other traditional elements of film making, you're really missing the point of Bad Lieutenant altogether.Herzog has a reputation for getting the \"crazy\" out of his actors and obviously this film is no exception, although the lion's share of the credit must go to Nicolas Cage, an actor as frustrating in the display of his considerable talents as any I can think of. For the most part, Cage has waltzed through the past two decades releasing such dreck as Next, the National Treasure movies, Bangkok Dangerous, and The Wicker Man (which just may be the worst film of the past quarter-century). His roles in many of these films are characterized by record-setting overacting and the familiar \"crazy look\" of Nicolas Cage. This is the \"bad\" Nicolas Cage. After awhile, I think we all began to think that perhaps Cage was simply playing himself. Perhaps he really was a world-class nut-job. However, every once in awhile he released a film to remind us that deep beneath the frequently terrible hair and generic action roles is a highly talented actor with nigh-unstoppable range. Just take a look at Moonstruck, Raising Arizona, Leaving Las Vegas, or Adaptation to see the \"good\" Nicolas Cage. Which brings us to his role as Lt. Terence McDonagh in Bad Lieutenant. What makes Cage's performance so interesting (aside from the bizarre physical characteristics he lent to the role), is that what we have here is essentially \"good\" Nicolas Cage playing \"bad\" Nicolas Cage, all within the confines of the story, and he totally nails it. The performance is simultaneously hilarious and frightening and Cage owns every second that he is on screen.I could go on to discuss the rest of the cast, or the film's bleached look or any other aspect of the film, but in all honesty this is a movie centered around one performance, one actor, and one man. They are all equally riveting. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

He basically plays a burned out police lieutenant (don't know how he rose to that rank), with a number of drug and alcohol addictions that is in love with a hooker (Ava Mendes) and who is constantly shaking down the citizens of New Orleans to feed his crack and cocaine addiction. Seems plausible, this is New Orleans ya know?Anyway, he gets all hosed up with the mob cause he cant cover his bets, and then he finds Xzibit who is obviously not in charge of the city library, and gets even more whacked out and starts halucinating about iguanas (which I've done too) and people soul dancing after they get shot a whole bunch of times so this is all pretty much my normal everyday thing, but you might have never witnessed this before thats why I'm writing this review.BTW, Fairuza Balk >>>>> Smoking HOT!Very good, highly underrated and darkly comic movie.

Now addicted to painkillers Cage embarks on a strange journey where the line to cross is not only blurred, it's not even there anymore. The movie is not bad as much as it is just weird. Cage does play a nut job very well and Val Kilmer has an interesting role too. There are several scenes shot from an alligator and lizard's perspective...odd.

    "review/text": "WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF DECENTRISTS!!To summarise in simple terms - brilliant , absolutely brilliant! Just plain brilliant! I saw it in the two hours that for me almost passed as two minutes! The film opened my senses to the reality of an ongoing presence of decentralists operating at the highest levels of New Orleans police - which is just what the people of New Orleans need!! Allow me to explain. 10 years ago , it became pretty much obvious to every awakening American that decentralization is a major important answer to the question of what is to be done about corruption in American politics and in the American police forces. In this film , the concept of total decentralization from bottom up is visualized. Several policemen decide to get the New Orleans police clean from corruption in a matter of a bet that will cost one of them thousands of U.S. dollars - merely a few weeks! They decide to rely upon the one policeman they can rely upon (the character played by Nicholas Cage) who understands that to get your area rid of corruption you must be corrupt for a while yourself. As the thin line between what corruption means on a philosophical level and what corruption really isn't is drawn - it becomes clear to the police officer , that decentralization is just as much a philosophical concept as corruption - in ways he would never have suspected. Faced with the possibility of loosing his job if he will not find and aid in the pleading of guilty the parties responsible for the deaths of three children and their mother , he decides to join for a while forces with some of the most corrupt among New Orlean's drug lords , and convinces them that he has no spiritual discernment whatsoever , while his spiritual discernment turns out in the end to be vastly superior to that which he had thought he really possessed. Nicholas Cage performs brilliantly as the uomo sinistrium of modern times - the sinister man who has replaced uomo universalis - the renaissance man.The renaissance man was more or less a liberal centrist , while the uomo sinistrium is first and foremost a decentrist individualist. The result becomes a totally surprising - albeit very happy ending , where it turns out how hard it really is for the main character to get himself rid of drug addiction. All sorts of moral questions as well as amoral ones are asked in the film and it leaves no area untouched for me that was needed to satisfy my senses as a serious viewer of Nicholas Cage movies (my favourite as a kid was Birdy).New Orleans is thus a terrific portrayal of what may happen , contrary to what most conspiracy writers believe today about the New Orleans police , if they decide one day to decentralize their positions from bottoms up. Already , decentralization of police is becoming a major factor of discussion in many areas of today's politics , now that the European Union is beginning to collapse , followed by the IMF. IMF's collapse is absolutely certain - and it may well have very beneficial consequences for today's present decentralists. I am big on decentralization myself and wholeheartedly support full decentralization of New Orlean's police. What makes this film so unique is how seriously it managed to express the meaning of the concept of 'decentralization'without ever needing to even mention the term.",

    "review/text": "Nicholas Cage is not one for subtle roles. He is great at playing the anti-hero. His good-cop-gone-bad character fits his screen persona perfectly. Eva Mendes leads a large cast of supporting characters who really make this an unforgettable movie in a genre that has been overdone lately. The Cage character is truly up against ALL odds, from drug dealers and mobsters to his boss, the D.A. and himself. The storyline is interesting and doesn't get lost despite the many detours it takes as Cage sinks further and further into the dark quicksand of his own making. Who will kill him first? Everyone wants to, and are all determined to take their best shot. There is a lot of dark comic relief thrown in to keep the movie-goer on their toes, and off balance, as Cage torques up his badness and shows no one any respect. This is an excellent movie, well-executed and full of unexpected quirkiness.I am at a loss to explain some of the negative reviews, especially those complaining of camera-work, etc. This movie is of no less quality than any other Hollywood movie. Sure, it lacks computer generated critters, exploding death stars and robot killers from the future ---but then this is not Aliens, Star Wars of T2. I will leave it at that, just to be nice. I think most intelligent movie fans will be able to see what is going on with those low reviews and dismiss them for what they are.Explanation of my five stars: I give one star each for Writing, Continuity, Acting, Concept/Plot, and Execution. This movie does them all very well. I do not rate movies based on my likes/dislikes, because that is not -in my opinion- a fair way to rate a movie. For instance, I rated Morning Glory five stars though it was a love story and I am no fan of same. But I considered the elements of the movie that would make it Good or Bad.WRITING: is the story easy-to-follow, believable (even if I must suspend belief there are some that are TOO silly to believe), unpredictable, complex, interesting?CONTINUITY: is the movie constructed in a way that all technical elements, camera work, wardrobe, make-up, location, effects make sense?ACTING: are the actors into the roles or just mouthing lines to earn their paychecks?CONCEPT/PLOT: is this a plausible concept that could happen in real life, OR is it constructed in a way that it is plausible given a required suspension of belief?EXECUTION: did the movie deliver expected emotion response(s), that is, horror, shock, happiness, sadness, hope, etc., depending on the genre and Concept/Plot?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thanks for reading my review. My goal is to help you get the most value for your hard-earned money and avoid an unpleasant customer experience. ROB",

Ever since John Ritter has passed away I've missed him very deeply, possibly more than any celebrity that's passed away. Now I have a wonderful starter collection to remember him by. The quality of the DVD is totally amazing! It's one of the best that I've had besides The Mary Tyler Moore season one set. At first I've always been surprised that the first season was on one DVD. When I did some research I realized it was a starter or a test season. I love all the episodes on this set: A Man About The House (The pilot episode), And Mother Makes Four, Roper's Niece, No Children, No Dogs, Jack The Giant Killer, & It's Only Money. You will not be sorry adding this to your collection. Also when you buy the first DVD a portion of it goes to John Ritter's charity UCP (United Cerebral Palsy) which I didn't even know he supported. The disk also has a little short tribute to John Ritter as well. So pick up the first season you won't be sorry with it's original loveable cast! And you'll just be amazed about how wonderful and clear all of the episodes and the quality of the DVD is!",

    "review/text": "This package contains all six episodes from the first season of ABC's hit sitcom THREE'S COMPANY. It premiered on March 15,1977 starring the late John Ritter as Jack Tripper,a young handsome aspiring chef who was then studying the culinary arts. Joyce DeWitt is Janet Wood,a brunette beauty who works in a flower shop and Suzanne Somers as blonde beauty Chrissy Snow who immediately interests Jack in many ways. Supporting cast members are the late Audra Lindley as Helen Roper and the late Norman Fell as Helen's husband Stanley. Stanley and Helen are the trio's landlords. In the first episode,Jack is asleep in the bathtub following a drinking binge from a party given by Janet and Chrissy the previous evening. The party was for Eleanor,Jack's predecessor in apartment 201. Eleanor had gotten married and given birth to a seven-pound and nine-ounce baby boy. So after Jack cooks a delicious breakfast for Janet and Chrissy,they invite him to be their new roommate. When Jack introduces himself to the Ropers,who live directly below the trio,he tells them he's moving in. But Stanley strongly denies until Janet told him Jack was gay(Stanley could never fathom a straight male platonically living with two straight women). In episode #2,Jack arrives with his belongings via taxicab from the YMCA where he previously resided,to apartment 201. He rings the bell,but instead of a chime he hears Stanley reacting to the electricity immersing in him as he was fixing the doorbell. Chrissy's mother came to L.A. for a dentist's appointment and planned to stay at the apartment. She sleeps in what would become Jack's bedroom and Jack sleeps on the couch(Jack would do that whenever there were house guests). In episode #3,it's Chrissy's birthday and the trio would celebrate amongst themselves. Stanley's young beautiful niece Karen is staying with the Ropers and Stanley pays Jack $50 to take her out despite Stanley believes Jack is gay. Jack promised the date would only last 20 minutes and he would come back home in time for the birthday celebration. Janet and Chrissy are furious with Jack. On the date,Jack who drives Stanley's car,had some trouble with it. It overheated on the freeway. He uses the $50 to reclaim the cameo Janet had hocked a while back for rent money. Jack and Karen are kissing in the Ropers' apartment and when the Ropers awake,Stanley catches Jack and Karen and immediately evicts him from apartment 201(\"He was acting normal,that's sick!\"). The eviction is cancelled after Karen,according to Stanley,practically attacked Jack and he showed no interest. In episode #4,Jack brings home a puppy,unaware that pets are forbidden in the apartment. Richard Kline as Larry Dallas,makes his first appearance on the show. Jack owed Larry $25 and Jack took the puppy to cancel the debt. Larry would later become Jack's best friend and the trio's upstairs neighbor. The trio parents the dog until Helen takes it in. A sleepwalking Chrissy planted the dog on the Ropers' doorstep. Helen declares the dog an anniversary present from Stanley. In episode #5,the trio redecorate the apartment and take a break to go to the neighborhood pub,the Regal Beagle,first seen in episode #2. There,at the bar are two guys and one of them takes interest in Chrissy. Chrissy feels harassed by the guy. He overhears Jack telling Janet and Chrissy that men are naturally stronger than women. He,the \"creep\",finds a \"man\" in the joint,Stanley. The \"creep\" accidentally spills Stanley's brandy and asks the bartender to give Stanley another one. Later Jack finally gets tough with the creep and for his(Jack's) so-called heroism,is given an on-the-house shot of whiskey. The creep harassed both Janet and Chrissy. In episode #6,Janet and Chrissy are out $300 in back rent money. Thinking the money was stolen,they call the police. Jack tries to get $300 from the financial aid department at his college and is denied. Janet and Chrissy don't realize until the end,that they had already paid the rent. Stanley naturally took the money,in an envelope with the word 'rent' on it, while doing a repair job. But he failed to leave a receipt indicating he received the payment(the tenant's/s' copy was still attached to his receipt book!).",

    "review/text": "Yes, Three's Company is the greatest show because of John Ritter's brilliance. All the seasons were great, but 6, 7, and 8 were easily the best because Chrissy was gone, and completely forgotten and the show could now focus on the power of Jack Tripper. Sure, Chrissy was a fine credit to the core of the show, but as she became dumber, she became more of a hindrance than a support to Jack. Terri, on the other hand, became the perfect complement to Jack, not to mention the fact that she was also much hotter than Chrissy. And, of course, Janet had always achieved a wonderful dynamic with Jack throughout all the seasons. The last 3 seasons not only showcased John Ritter's unbelievable physicality in greater amounts, but the actual content of the show focused on Jack's life. In other words, the whole premise of a guy living with 2 girls was virtually worn out and extinct. As a result the content became broader and the show became much funnier. But all of the credit for this improvement is bestowed to John Ritter. This indeed was John Ritter's show, and the show would not have had anywhere near the amount of appeal with some other actor. The first season unfortunately does not showcase John Ritter, but revolves around the 3 roommates. Nevertheless, just his presence is electrifying and his magnificence envelops you. Celebrate the Greatest Show by the Greatest Man through this DVD!",

    "review/text": "Bursting onto the television landscape in Spring 1977, Three's Company quickly skyrocketed in the ratings - cracking the top 8 every season except its last. Sporting a plethora of quirky characters and fresh writing talent that explored modern day issues, the show held its own as one of the funniest programs on TV. Picking up where All In The Family left off, Three's Company delved into the social taboos of its day, dealing with subjects such as homosexuality, racism, sexual harassment, and of course, unmarried men and women living together... But the true success of Three's Company stemmed from the comic talents of John Ritter and Suzanne Somers who became instant stars as a result of their respective roles on the show...In Three's Company, John Ritter plays the role of Jack Tripper, a young cooking student in San Diego who wants to move into an apartment with his two female friends - the far more mature Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt) and the blonde and ditsy Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers). But the three friends face the possible wrath of landlord Stanley Roper (Norman Fell), an old-fashioned guy who would never allow such an arrangement. With the aid of Roper's wife Helen (Audra Lindley), the three manage to convince Stanley that Jack is gay (when he is, in fact, a notorious ladies man). Jack's friend Larry (Richard Kline) also fashions himself a player on the local singles scene, and he makes regular appearances on the show. Following Season 3, Stanley and Helen left the show in pursuit of their own spin-off titled The Ropers. Don Knotts (of Andy Griffith Show fame) was brought in to play the new landlord, Mr. Furley - a nave, loud-mouthed ditz who tripled the hilarity of every scene in which he appeared...The Three's Company (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere \"A Man About the House\" in which roommates Janet Wood and Chrissy Snow throw a going away party for their roommate Eleanor. In search of another roommate to lower the rent burden, the two run across Jack Tripper passed out in their bathtub. At first, the two women are apprehensive about Jack becoming their third roommate, but since they can't cook and he's in cooking school, they agree. The only problem is convincing their old-fashioned landlord Stanley Roper to allow a man to live with two women. They convince him by telling Stanley that Jack is gay... Other notable episodes from the shortened Season 1 include \"And Mother Makes Four\" in which Chrissy attempts to conceal from her mother that a man is one of her roommates, and \"Roper's Niece\" in which Mr. Roper sets Jack up with his promiscuous niece in order to see if Jack is really gay...Below is a list of episodes included on the Three's Company (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (A Man About the House)Episode 2 (And Mother Makes Four)Episode 3 (Roper's Niece)Episode 4 (No Children, No Pets)Episode 5 (Jack the Giant Killer)Episode 6 (It's Only Money)The DVD Report",

    "review/text": "It was inevitable that Three's Company would be released on DVD, the only surprise is that it took this long to get here. Finally, the first 6 episodes of this landmark sitcom that aired between March & April 1977 are preserved on digital. Each episode is a classic in its own right and memorable if you know the show. Three's Company, more than anything John Ritter did, best displayed his talent for comedy, especially physical. Ritter had the ability to turn the lamest storyline into a laughfest. This also is easily his best and most popular work, other sitcoms such as \"Hearts Afire\" and \"8 Simple Rules\" hold no comparison and its obvious that the only reason those shows made it was because of Ritter's involvment. The same can be said about Three's Company to some extent, not to exclude the contributions of Joyce Dewitt & Suzanne Somers. Some are of the mindset that Chrissy was the show (maybe she just thought that), but I've always thought it was about Jack. He should've been paid more, not because he's a man, but because if he left the show, it would've ended. 8 simple rules doesn't have long believe me. Three's Company was special because all of the characters were important to the show and they each were hilarious in their own right: The Ropers (Norman Fell & Audra Lindley, Larry (Richard Kline), Mr. Furley (Don Knotts), Cindy (Jenilee Harrison), and Terri (Priscilla Barnes). The first season is so important: Its where Janet & Chrissy find Jack sleeping in their bathtub and its where we meet the Ropers and Jack tells them he's gay! And that's just the first episode! Here's the classic episodes you get:01. A Man about the house02. And Mother makes four03. Roper's niece04. No children, no dogs05. Jack the giant killer06. It's only moneyAnchor Bay has done a great job with presenting the first season and has included a featurette on John Ritter. Yes it would've been great to have more features, but having the first 6 episodes that started it all is treasure enough! I hope they intend to release all 7 following seasons. Even though there were cast changes through out, Three's Company found a way to keep the laughter going. God Bless John Ritter for giving us so much laughter. Thanks to Anchor Bay for releasing this on DVD so we can relive it again and again! What a great show to own! The second season has 25 episodes, please don't take long to release that too!",

    "review/text": "I loved this show. The show has taken on a &quot;larger than life&quot; persona over the years, which I think is misplaced. You'd think it was &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot; &quot;All in the Family,&quot; or &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot; with all the hype this show has received over the years. It isn't any of those things. It's simply a cute, light comedy show that always makes you laugh and is hilariously silly all the time. It also works to show off the bodies of Suzanne Somers, and even John Ritter. This first season really reminds you what the show really was, simple cute episodes with a lot of laughs, that doesn't take itself seriously as so many people today take this show as. The cast seems so young here, but you get a feel for the show and see the real comic genius of all involved, particularly Ritter. Though the price reflects this, this is only six-epidode DVD. If you've seen other first season DVD's for other shows, be aware that this is not a 20+ episode disc. It is six episodes that you will be able to watch within 2-3 hours as this show was a mid-season replacement so the first season was in fact only 6 episodes. There are no extras, apart from a brief written summary of each show and a brief written tribute to Ritter. I have no idea about the techical aspects of the transfer, but sound, image, and color seem good to me.",

Sound quality is good and the picture is also pretty good. If you do buy this dvd its for the terrific performances of John Ritter, Norman Fell and Audrey Lindley. The only complanint I had with the Dvd is that it does not have a play all feature on the main menu so if a show ends you have to start another one instead of the shows playing straight through.",

I laughed and fell in love again with all the characters as I was watching the show for the firs time.The screenplays are beautiful, and all the actors give stunning performances.I also found both very respectful and relaxed the way the show dealt with homosexuality. It offered to viewers of the late Seventies (first Eighties in Italy, wher I live) different points of view and attitudes towards gay people, (from the conservative character of Norman Fell to his relaxed wife Audra Lindley).I can say it helped a lot of gay people to see and judge themselves in a different and better way.I am gay and even though I was not aware of that at the time I watched the show for the first time, I later understood how much that little sitcom helped me get out of the closet and feel a person like everybody else.The only thumbs-down goes to the total absence of subtitles.Nonetheless, this dvd is a must have!",

When their roommate leaves to get married, they need to find another roommate. Coincidently, one morning both girls find a guy sleeping in their bathtub. This guy, Jack Tripper (John Ritter) is studying to be a chef, and therefore he's a good cook. Janet and Chrissy asks Jack if he wants to move in with them, and Jack accepts. But landlord Stanley Roper (Norman Fell) won't allow a guy living in the same house as the girls, so Janet tells him Jack is gay. Later on in the season, Helen (Mrs. Roper - Audra Lindley) finds out Jack isn't really gay, but just playing so that Mr. Roper allows him to live there.This 6-episode season 1 DVD is awesome. The episodes are really funny and I love the Ropers conversations towards each other.",

However, suggesting this product is a &quot;tribute&quot; DVD is laughable as the only &quot;extra&quot; feature besides the 6 original episodes themselves, is a short write-up on the actor which states little except to say that some of the proceeds for the sale of this DVD will go to a charity in Ritter's honour. If you ask me, a more worthy &quot;tribute&quot; would have been a compilation of his best moments from the series, a documentary of his life, or cast interviews showering him with praise. It is a very smug marketing ploy to push sales of the DVD without raising production costs. However, for those who are a fan of the quirky show, it is still a welcomed addition to one's catalog.

Janet and Chrissy find Jack passed out in their bathtub one morning after a going away party for their roommate. They need a roommate and Jack needs a place to stay, and bing bang boom, the premise of the show is born. But, this is the 1970's and a man living with two women is a bit scandalous. The Ropers, the landlords of the building, won't hear of it. So Janet tells the Ropers that Jack is gay. Even watching this show in the 21st century, it is evident how ahead of it's time it was. A gay man, two women living with a man and innuendos galore demonstrate just how ahead of its time the show was.",

Grest to see the late John Ritter starting in the role he became most famous for.I loved it for the genuine laughs on the show as well as looking at the fashions, prices, hair, and late 70s attitudes on the show.After these six I had to immediately purchase season two which I'm finding just as good as this.Even though it's 30+ years old, this is a quality show and well worth owning.",

    "review/text": "Has it been almost 30 years since the debut of Three's Company? Many good and bad shows have come and gone, but Three's Company remains a familiar sitcom providing laughs and good memories. With the passing of John Ritter still on most fans mind it is extra special to watch the earlier episodes especially. He was a brilliant physical comedian/actor and dramatically underrated too. Gone too are both Audra Lindley and Norman Fell who were so good they branched off and had their own series. They live on in these episodes and in our hearts.One thing interesting about the first season is how different (looking and acting) each character is. Jack and Chrissy are both very into each other, but follow the rules and keep things relatively clean. Speaking of Chrissy, she is more reserved and not the complete \"ditz\" she transforms into in later seasons. Janet too is less bossy and protective. I think only Jack stays pretty much constant through the years.This collection features the following episodes:A Man About the House - The pilot featuring the \"girls\" meeting Jack (sleeping in the tub) for the first time as well as an introduction to the Ropers. Jack's \"lifestyle\" is established much to his objection.And Mother Makes Four - Chrissy's Mother decides to pop in and then later spend the night, thus creating a frantic/hilarious scenario for the \"kids\". Jack's famous human lampshade impersonation is displayed which still is a riot.Roper's Niece - Jack and the girls have planned a little party for Janet's birthday. Roper's niece is in town and needs a night out to be away from the elder Ropers. Stanley Roper thinks Jack is a safe date, but Jack is disinterested. He quickly changes plans and goes out her upon seeing her. The ending especially is very heart warming.No Children, No Pets - Larry Dallas is introduced and offers a cute puppy to the kids. The only problem is the \"No Pets, No Children\" policy the Ropers strictly enforce. The first of many \"miscommunications\" occurs Janet thinks the worst, eaves dropping on Jack and Chrissy.Jack the Giant Killer - A bully hits on the girls at the Regal Beagle right in front of Jack. Jack is embarrassed as he does not stand up for himself. A very funny episode many guys can relate to.It's Only Money - The rent money is missing and the kids assume they have been robbed. In their frenzy, they avoid the Ropers at any cost as they look for time and money.Six episodes that lay the foundation to one of the great sitcoms of TV History in one DVD! Laugh, cry, and laugh louder!",

    "review/text": "Three's Company first hit the airwaves almost 26 years ago, and it presented its North American viewers with a comedic styling that was truly fresh and new. Both the brilliance and the downside of the series lay in the simplicity of its plots. Usually, the fun and mayhem of the episodes would result from some sort of mixup or misunderstanding would occur which caused a friction, obstacle or problem that the characters would have to overcome. Ultimately, the misunderstanding would always be resolved, leaving the beloved cast of characters pretty much as we found them. But as with all great comedies, the show's strength and uniqueness really did lie in the mix of the show's central characters and the actors that portrayed them. The original casting of John Ritter, Joyce DeWitt and Suzzane Somers as Jack, Janet &amp; Chrissy - the three roommates of apartment 201 - is perfect right from the start. Add to this mix Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as the romantically frustrated landlords Mr. &amp; Mrs. Roper, and you're set for one wild ride of a show. What truly is unique about the series is the fact that the show really was an ensemble piece - and when you revisit this series, you really do find that no one actor rose above the rest. All of the actors involved in the show shared a particular gift for comedy, especially the late John Ritter, whose timing, pratfalls and physical comedy truly were second to none. All-in-all, it adds up to a great series that really has the power to make you laugh. The show didn't start off so smoothly however, as the casting of the female leads took awhile. In fact, three pilots were shot, all involving different actresses, but all involving John Ritter as Jack Tripper. As such, the first season of the series, which is only six episodes long, didn't premiere until March of 1977. And now the entire first season of this series came out on DVD and in spite of a lack of extras, Three's Company is worth adding to any DVD collection.",

    "review/text": "Three's Company is the first and last sitcom to effectively blend physical comendy with effective one liners. Many of the popular sitcoms today such as Friends and Will and Grace have the satisfying one liners, but are opaque in the area of physical comedy. John Ritter's falling over the couch, tip toeing not to be seen, and tripping over things elevate this sitcom from great to amazing.In 1977, the kind of double entendre humor spoken all through the series invoked snarls on conservative TV viewers. Yet, it was that same humor that made it numder one on the Nielson Ratings. It's King-like status on TV because of the sexually racy humor attracted viewers because of it's innocence about sex. The humor wasn't for shock value. The lines about promiscuity were delivered by the cast as innocently as we heard it over the tube. That child-like and non \"in your face\" approach made Three's Company heartwarming as well as extremly funny.The series had few cameras working with the cast so the episodes have a unparelled equality to a one act on stage. Therefore, it is easy to see the cast playing off each other for emotional support as well as professionally. It is hard to watch an episode of this gem and not laugh out loud, And it will be extremely difficult not to well an eye for the late \"Man About the House\" who paved the way for the phyisical comedians today. This series will never be equalled.",

    "review/text": "Hello, I am the webmaster of the Jack's Bistro website. I received an advanced copy of this wonderful DVD last week, and here is my review of it:I have had the pleasure to watch the DVD already for review. It is excellent and the quality of the episodes amazes me. Fans have been complaining for years about the edits the reruns have on TV, now the complaining will stop! As each episode will be unedited. Season 1 had only six episodes, and run about 24-25 minutes per episode. Only one episode has a tag scene in season one (\"Roper's Niece\"), but when season two comes out, that will be a different story. In this DVD, we have of course, the six episodes, along with an \"In Memory of John\" feature, and a sneak peek at \"Season Two.\" The \"In Memory of John\" feature also has a nice clip from the charity John was so involved with, UCP. Portions of the money from the sales will go to that charity. So it will be for a good cause. All fans should DEFINITELY buy season one in tribute to John and also, so we can eventually get all eight seasons on DVD (yes, that means unedited!). Hopefully the DVD's sell out fast and they realize that they made the right decision on making seasonal DVD's for Three's Company. Chris Mann was involved in this project as well, so for sure all fans will be pleased, as his judgment is the best. Though, this DVD was supposed to come put in early 2004, I was still impressed on how well it was made. The title shot and menu screen is amazing--everyone will love it. All the episodes have a synopsis before you watch an episode. All the extras that were planned for this season, will be inserted in the season two DVD, which will now come out it in early 2004 (Spring or so). Also a more in depth tribute to John Ritter will be in that DVD. Each season will get better and better. If you have not ordered yet, it's not too late. You can click on one of the links above and buy a copy (or two!). So, please everyone buy it, so we can get all eight seasons released.Thanks,http://jacksbistro.freeservers.com/",

    "review/text": "The season one \"Three's Company\" DVD is something very special. It is a DVD that has the first six (6) episodes of a series that tickled my funny bone as early as the age of 5. I was especially proud to purchase this DVD today since the proceeds from it not only went towards a cause close to John Ritter's heart (a man whose work I've admired for many years), but one close to mine as well because John's brother Tom and I share that common ground. \"Three's Company\" stars John Ritter as Jack Tripper; Joyce DeWitt as Janet Wood; Suzanne Somers as Chrissy Snow; Norman Fell as the \"uninterested\" landlord, Mr. Stanley Roper and Audra Lindley as Mrs. Helen Roper, his \"sex-starved\" wife.First, I'd like to review the episodes. The pilot, \"A Man About The House,\" was a good episode (surprisingly not my favorite of this season), although, I liked it because it introduced not only the beginning of the series but a relationship with my favorite trio, Jack, Janet and Chrissy. There is also a scene in this episode, at the beginning, which had never been aired in the series' syndicated runs.The second episode, \"And Mother Makes Four,\" was OK. I liked John Ritter's physical comedy in this episode, although, I do not want to give the plot away.The third episode, \"Roper's Niece,\" is my favorite episode this season, because of a \"touching\" ending, between Jack and Janet. The scene I'm referring to brought a tear to my eye. I don't want to give it away. Watch it, and you'll know why.The fourth episode, \"\"No Children, No Dogs,\" was all right. It introduced Richard Kline as Jack's best friend Larry for the first time. I thought that was cool.The fifth episode, \"Jack and The Giant Killer,\" was good, and the sixth, and last, episode of the season, \"It's Only Money,\" was OK.The best episode was \"Roper's Niece,\" but these six episodes are a great start to a wonderful sitcom. One of the DVD features had a paragraph written about the season two DVD (due out in early spring, 2004), and the John Ritter tribute at the end was a written paragraph about how he and his brother helped raise money for United Cerebral Palsy with a UCP commercial narrated by actor, John Mahoney (\"Frasier's\" Martin Crane). You'll love it. It's definitely a great taste of a wonderful series to come.",

    "review/text": "Three's Company is a jewel in the rough, who knew that this 70's sitcom can beat out most of what's on TV today. It not only makes you laugh but the intelligent wit, sarcasm and charm threw into each episode gives it a kick, some jokes and one liners are so good that I can't believe I it took me so long to finally watch this. Of course I didn't discover it myself, my boyfriend made me watch it - I saw the entire 1st season in one sitting, and that's coming from a girl who doesn't like to watch TV! I couldn't get enough and simply had to see the whole thing.The premise sounds simple enough; two female roommates, Janet and Chrissy who have a third roommate, Jack - pretending that he's gay in order not to get evicted by the landlords Mr and Mrs. Roper. They are trying to balance their new friendship and the snooping landlords, visiting parents and not get caught while going through challenges of life and work in a funny, lighthearted manner. The stress in this show is comedic, not draining to the viewer.I think there's something cozy and cute about 70's d&eacute;cor and even the semi hideous clothing that I find fascinating. My favorite character is the landlady, her sarcasm is priceless and her smug remarks jabbing at her husband and lack of passion in the bedroom are sharp but unquestionably hilarious. Her eye rolling and faces are priceless too, her character ads a level of delightful mischief to the show. The first season is just six episodes but I all ready have the rest and can't wait to sink into it. The real fun part is that each episode has a theme and things always go crazy and get out of hand for the roommates. Not getting caught or figuring out the problem is always a fun resolution at the end of each show.Fun and easy to watch, perfect for the weekend when you can sit down, grab a snack and try not to fall of the couch from laughing.- Kasia S.",

    "review/text": "Readers, when you purchase this dvd, put on the pilot episode (entitled \"Man About The House\"), and fast - foward to the scene were Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers) finds Jack Tripper (John Ritter) asleep in the bathtub, drenched in water. It is not only one of the funniest moments in tv history, but the scene that shows what a genius Ritter really was.The release of \"Three's Company\" on dvd is a bittersweet event for the show's fan. While it's great to have this piece of television history to watch anytime you'd like, it's also sad because comes just months after John Ritter's shocking and untimely death. But as a tribute to his life and career, it's great to have.And I'm not saying that Ritter was the only actor who made the people laugh. Somers and Joyce DeWitt (Janet Wood) set up most of the gags that happened on the show, and sometimes outdid Ritter. And who can forget the late Norman Fell and Audra Lindley as Mr. Roper and his sex - hungry wife Helen. Their one -liners against each other were every bit as funny as Ritter getting smashed by a door or Somers delivering one of her stupid comments. Making an early appearance is Larry, played flawlessly by the highly underrated Richard Kline. He appears briefly in \"No Children, No Dogs\".As for the episodes, the pilot is an absolute classic. \"No Children, No Dogs\" and \"It's Only Money\" are excellent as well (the former features some of the best insluts between Helen and Stanley). As for the other three, they are good too, but not worth mentioning.My only gripe about this dvd is that there are no extras. No advertisements or a making - of documentary. I do not know if Anchor Bay meant to do this right from the start or they did out of respect for John Ritter. But it doesn't matter, since the complete second season is coming out on dvd in March and is supposed to be loaded with extra. Until then, this will keep you satisfid for a long time and you'll remember that three's company, too.",

There aren't any extras or interviews by surviving cast members, which would have been nice (hint for season two's DVD). The episodes are presented in their original full-screen 1.33:1 ratio, and sadly a little compressed - the picture is artifacted somewhat. I would have preferred two disks with less compression myself (another suggestion for season two).But this was a wonderful sitcom; one of the all-time greats from the golden-age of evening TV sitcoms. It pushed a few buttons in its day, but just stands the test of time today for its charming personalities, cute writing, and clever comedic timing.Well worth the wait - well worth the price - and well worth remembering.

    "review/text": "I was reluctant to buy this disc because of its high price/few episodes ratio. (Come on, &quot;All in the Family&quot; gets 26 episodes for $30, that's under $1 per episode and that's how it should be for all TV!) However, as a proceed of the purchase (how much they won't tell us, hmmmm...) goes to a charity John Ritter adored, I broke down tonight and bought it.After the ubiquitous FBI screen disappears, I was greeted with a menu. Ignore the naysayers, there is nothing wrong with how this menu works and I've used far, far worse in my 300 movie collection. I rather like the menu... And the fact they have a menu option telling us of the Spring 2004 release for season 2 made my day, it's nice to see they'll put out this series for the fans.Now for the transfer. Audio quality is superb, well restored. Video quality is a different story. Upon freeze-framing, it's very clear that, despite doing a good job at restoring the master tapes, they did a rather poor transfering the video to DVD. (You HDTV fans out there may not like watching this on your sets... and by 1996, the FCC is pulling the plug on current broadcast standards...) I can think of 2 reasons why the video looks as poor as it does, but it suffices to say that the end result is a video image that looks needlessly grainy; broadcast video technology of the time never ever looked this bad. But while not as bad as VHS consumer quality videotape, it is well below acceptable DVD quality. (for another example of what not to do in terms of transfrring video quality onto DVD, check out the dithering used in &quot;The Best of the Chris Rock Show&quot; - yuck!) But given the price of this disc and that &quot;All in the Family&quot; costs less per episode and yet looks far better (despite NOT having had its master tapes restored), I'm knocking 2 points off. DVD video should not ever look this grainy in a freeze-frame. (it is bearable when things in motion, but be prepared for a shock if you're a &quot;quality freak&quot;.)6 episodes. I was pondering the same issue, why not have a season 1 + 2 box set? But then we'd have to wait until spring, and I hate waiting, though I would have if the video looked better. Besides, these episodes are HILARIOUS. The gags, the double entendres, the Ropers... it's all there. And when you are laughing so much you start to cry and get a stomachache, you know you're watching a winner of a show that's well written and well cast. No wonder &quot;Three's Company&quot; became a success so quickly. As other reviewers here and other websites post plot synopses and reviews, I won't here. (well, &quot;No Dogs, No Children&quot; was probably my favorite of the bunch, especially the scene where Chrissy and Jack are in the kitchen feeding the puppy...)And the real downfall is, John Ritter died an untimely death. :-( He will be missed. He was a great actor and sounded like a great guy too. Very rare in the industry...",

If the DVD had loads of commentaries, bloopers, unshown episodes and the girls in a naked 2-some in window-shuddering Dolby 5.1, I would be hard pressed to give it a one-star rating.I undertand this is brainless jiggle TV, but can't we find 3 better [ones] to look at?(I can't believe Amazon's censors ruined my joke :-). That is very common word with 2 \"b\"s and 2 \"o\"'s that even 10 year olds speak without guilt. In another post, they censored a non sexual use of \"suck\" as in \"this sucks.\")And yes, I realize I'm not making any friends here. However, I discussed this show with 2 work-mates today and neither could honestly think of a worse show, except possibly \"What's Happenin'?\" or \"Welcome Back, Kotter\".",

    "review/text": "Three's Company is about as overrated as a TV show can get. First of all, every single episode is about the same. How many episodes can be written on a simple misunderstanding? John Ritter was talented, but this show caused him to be castwritten for the rest of his life. The guy acted gay just a little 'too' well if you ask me. The best you can say about this show is that Suzanne Somers used to jump around and jiggle without a bra.Don't be fooled by the cover. Joyce DeWitt did not look this hot until much later in the show. For now she still has the dippy-doo haircut and has the sex appeal of a cactus. The producers of the show didn't make her sexy until Suzanne left.\"Larry\" the used car salesman upstairs may have played a ladie's man, but he was just plain scary, like a werewolf. When was that hairstyle ever popular? His eyebrows seemed to reach out and grab people. The guy was as hairy as a rug too. Just looking at his arms you couldn't tell what race he was.Well, John died recently while making a show with the sexiest woman on television, Katey Sagal. People are saying this DVD release is a tribute to John. Poo poo I say. If Three's Company needed a much needed tribute it was to the great Norman Fell, aka Mr. Roper. He was funnier than four John Ritters. I mean c'mon he had lines like \"Hey it's easy to find my wife on a nude beach, she's the one that looks like her socks are rolled down!\" Now that is humor my friends. So if you must buy this DVD, buy it for an overlooked comedian, the late great Norman Fell.",

    "review/text": "I grew up watching this show, I was 11 years old with several months to go before I turned 12 when Three's Company came on TV and I thought it was a cute show. Yes it was silly but sometimes I think we need a good dose of silly especially on a really stressful day and John Ritter really knew how to make people laugh, he was very funny and so cute and he will be loved and missed by all his fans! The only complaint I have with this DVD is the sound is kind of low and I have to put the volume on the TV pretty high and then make sure I put it back down before I turn the DVD off as not to blast the eardrums of the next person who turns the television on but I'm pleased with everything else. The DVD is actually pretty cheap in price and is worth buying and the fact that they are donating money to a charity for Cerebral Palsy which John's brother has was one of the reasons I decided to buy the DVD, the other being that I wanted to have the very first episode on DVD, the one where the morning after Janet and Chrissy had the going away party for their old roomate Eleanor and they find Jack asleep in their bathtub. FYI: There is a good reason that this DVD only has 6 episodes and that is because there were only 6 episodes in season one, it was a mid-season replacement and they in fact only had 6 episodes so they aren't trying to cheat you by releasing seperate volumes of season 1 on a bunch of seperate DVDs. This is in fact all there is of season one! I mention that because there seems to be a couple of reviewers who think that there are more season one episodes and that they are going to release them in seperate volume sets.",

    "review/text": "Watching Three's Company again after all these years, I did laugh a lot, and not only because of some nostalgic feeling that overwhelmed me, having grown up expecting every single episode,every single week with a sort of enthusiasm that comes with the anticipation that something good is about to happen; But I also enjoyed watching the show again because simply it is one of the best sitcoms ever produced for television in any language.Yet I could not help feeling a tinge of sadness,reliving all these funny and wonderful episodes, at the early and untimely death of its star John Ritter.The success of Three's Company was certainly due to the excellent writing, that combined successfully the situation comedy with the physical/slapstick genre,one that unfortunately is nowadays either overlooked by the new breed of comedy writers or not well written/delivered,in addition to a very 70s touch of sexual innuendos and harmless cliches about 'bimbos' and 'gays' that were good natured and never sexist or discriminatory.All the actors contributed their best comic talents and timing to the show, from the cute and smart Joyce de Witt, the naive, sexy and sweet Suzanne Sommers, the Roppers, Norman Fell and Audra Lindley, to the later actors who replaced some characters, like the genuis of a comedian that is Don Knotts who became the new landlord post '79, to Sommers replacements, Priscilla Barnes and Jenilee Harrison.But as much as the show made these actors household names, its success was equally due to Ritter.The sweet, clumsy, and charming qualities he brought to Jack, endeared him with millions of viewers and ensured that the show ran from its first season in 1977, all the episodes from which are included in this DVD, to its last season in 1984, amazing continuity: he made the show as much as it made him.Three's company is a must see and buy sitcom that will introduce a whole new generation to what real comedy should be, and give my generation a chance to laugh their heads off again,while all the same paying a well deserved tribute to an actor who has delighted us all with his enormous talent and heart.",

    "review/text": "FINALLY! No more need to keep knocking on the door -- It's here in all it's 70s glory! The first season of Three's Company has arrived and I'm here to tell you about it.Well, it is only six episodes -- but all on one disc. Reason being is that Three's Company was a mid-season replacement so there's only six to begin with.Not much on the extras, but a nice bonus. From the menu, you get to pick which one you want to watch and when you select it, it has a quick written overview of each episode. Unusual and nice for a DVD TV series. Bad part is, once you watch an episode, you can't hit the forward button to pass up the credits or go to the next scene -- it automatically ends the episode taking you back to the main menu.Otherwise, you'll be happy to know that a percentage of the cost of the first season DVD will go to John Ritter's favorite charity for cerebral palsy (something his older brother suffered from) and that the next season will have more of a tribute to John. So, whereas the contents are fairly minimal, the price is definitely worth it and more will come in the next disc.No more waiting for you &quot;Door Knockers&quot; out there -- Three's Company is here to stay.",

I laughed so many times during each epsiode... usually because of John Ritter's style of comedy, but really, every actor in this show has their moments. And when you hear the audience laughing, that's no laugh track, that's a REAL audience which really adds to the quality of the show.Watching the show mostly when I was younger, I had no idea, until now, how good the writing was on this show... it's actually very intricately written and pushes the level of comedy to the max! A really amazing show!And if you are worried that the first season of Three's Company may not be as good as the later seasons, have no fears, the first season is hilarious!The DVD has a short synopsis of each episode, no other features.

I do not even like tv or movies. For someone like myself to give such a positive review of a tv show really speaks volumns. There are only 2 tv shows that I really love so much that I could watch them all day: \"Three's Company\" and \"Unsolved Mysteries\".This tv show has a cute and cozy atmosphere. Three young people (2 girls and a guy) share an apartment to save on the rent. They all become friends and hilarious things happen to them. This show is so cozy; I remember when I was a teenager, I used to eagerly wait for the next episode to come on tv. Janet was always my favorite character, and she still is.Janet is a florist; Chrissy is a secretary; and Jack is in cooking school and picks up odd jobs. Janet is the sweet, thoughtful, and intelligent character. Chrissy is somewhat on the \"dumb blonde\" side. Jack is just a normal guy.The old fashions brought back memories from my teenager days. One of the episodes had a typewriter in it; that also brought back memories. Instead of a computer (which a modern day tv show would have), it had an old fat typewriter. And even though these shows are somewhat \"old\", they don't seem old to me. (I mean, there are no horse and buggies or slide rulers.)I have really missed this show throughout the years, and always knew I would eventually buy the DVDs. But another customer's review made me really miss the show even more; therefore, I bought the first season.Now I can't wait to get the second season. And while I'm at it, I might get an \"Unsolved Mysteries\" DVD as well.",

    "review/text": "The 1970s' marked the rise of the sitcom. There were early signs of this in the 1960s' with shows like \"The Nelsons\" and \"The Donna Reed Show\". Shows like \"All In The Family\" were among the first hit sitcoms, But the sitcoom boom didn't really take off untila round 1974, when \"Happy Days\" and \"Good Times\" hit the air. These shows opened the door for a long line of sitcom hits - \"The Jeffersons\", \"The Facts Of Life\", \"Barney Miller\" and many others to name a few. Thrown into this barrage of sitcoms was \"Three's Company\". It turned out to be tv gold, garnering huge ratings and making star out of Joyce DeWitt, Suzanne Somers and, of course, the late John Ritter.\"Three's Company\" was first aired in 1977. Shows like the ones I just mentioned were in their peak period. But \"Three's Company\" was different from most. Its plotline was more risque:a man living in an apartment pretending to be gay in order to live with 3 lovely women, much to the dismay of the sexually problmeatic landlords, The Ropers (Norman Fell and Audra Lindley). But the show worked. For starters, the acting was great. The three stars had a full understanding of their charcters' characteristics. Plus, the show as well - written with many great oneliners.The release of this dvd was bittersweet, coming out about 11 weeks after the shocking and untimely death of John Ritter from heart failure. And anyon who thinks this was a way to cash in on Ritter's death is wrong because his dvd was scheduled for release long before his passing.The episodes here are hilarious. The first episode is the pilot, \"Man About The House\". This one gives a very good introduction to the characters; Chrissy, the sexy and stupid blonde who attracts all different kinds of men, Janet the plain but pretty girl who would kill to get a good man, and of course Jack, the bumbling skirtchaser who pretends he's gay to live with the two girl. Actually, at first he just wants to make it with Chrissy, but as the series goes on he grows to love Janet just as much.The other episodes are all good except for the one entitled \"Roper's Niece\". I just didn't like this one. But my favorites were \"No Children, No Dogs\" (featuring the first appearance of richard Kline's Larry) and \"It's Only Money\".Overall, a great dvd. With season 2 just released, I cn't wait for seasons and 4. However, seasons 5 - 8 I can wait for. During these years, Suzanne Somers was fired from the show and replaced with the flacid Terry played Priscilla Barnes. Jack started to become less attracted to the girls in the aprtment and focused more on his job. Pity it had to end that way. If they had kept Chrissy til the end, it could've lasted longer.",

Originally a mid-season replacement, Three's Company became such a bona fide (and can you believe?) controversial show that ABC ordered up a full second season. The premise of the show is simple: Chrissy and Janet need a third roommate tp help with the bills when they meet Jack Tripper. The only problem? The landlord, Mr. Roper, won't allow a man to live with two women. The solution? Tell him Jack pitches for the other team. The show is heavy on farce (A light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect) and John Ritter's Jack is the highlight with his physical comedy. The show went on to last eight years and inspired two spin-offs: \"The Ropers\" and \"Three's a Crowd.\" There is a reason this show has lasted so long on syndication. Watch this set and you'll see why.",

They goofed up sometimes and the studio audience always loved it!John Ritter's humor and schtick filtered it's way into my style of bartending when I worked for TGI Friday's in the 80's. It helped my tip income for sure. I hope they put out \"Hooperman\" on DVD and only wish Hooperman could have been given a better chance than the one season run it had. BUY this DVD if you love humor that is timeless at times it seems John borrowed from the great ones like the Stooges, Abbott and Costello and the young Jerry Lewis and put his own touch on it....The ladies on the show gave John the perfect platform to do his thing! Joyce, we wish you would work more, we love you too!To the Producers: if you read this, get those DVD's released like Friends is doing FAST !!!Enjoy the memories of John and the rest of the crew, they were the best!

Also, the script for the second episode \"And Mother Makes Four\" is nearly identical to the second pilot co-starring Joyce DeWitt as Janet and Susan Lanier as Chrissy. Also in season one, Richard Kline makes his debut as Larry Dallas with a small guest part in the episode \"No Children No Dogs.\" Although it was at first only intended to be a guest part, Larry would eventually become a regular character at the request of John Ritter. In season 2, the laughter continues with the season opener \"Ground Rules,\" a hysterical bedroom scene in \"Strange Bedfellows,\" the series' only holiday episode, and a guest appearance by Loni Anderson. John Ritter, you are greatly missed!",

The pilot episode could not have been executed any better and it appears as if this was one of only a handful of TV series in the annals of history that began a long run already in full stride. And in six episodes nonetheless!I highly recommend this and future season releases, beginning in 2004 -- which will contain bonus materials! John Ritter may be gone, but thanks to his large body of work and my DVD player, I won't be forgetting him.(For those thinking Anchor Bay is simply out to make a buck off the passing of TV legend John Ritter, take notice: the DVD rights to \"Three's Company\" were purchased several months before his death and he had even been scheduled to work with Anchor Bay on supplemental material for the DVD releases)",

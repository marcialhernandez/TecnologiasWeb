    "review/text": "Here in Japan, this film was given a limited theatrical release. in 2001. Before I see this movie, I knew this film went straight to video in US,so I didn't expect much fun from it. Frankly, the plot is a dull one; the situation is borrowed from the typical &quot;leginnaire&quot; films like Beau Geste, and there is nothing new nor original here. Well, and for fans of the previous films of the star, it must be disappointing because there is no bone- crunching action scenes. Still, it has good, authentic location, and superb supporting cast including Steven Berkoff and Nicholas Farrell. My favorite actor, Steven Berkoff, displays his over-the-top acting (though a bit overacting, you may think), and I find it very delightful, and Nicholas Farrell's subtle performance is giving some reason for not avoiding the video. Not a classic, but good one of the genre.",

I watched this movie only a half hour ago and I liked all the way. The acting of Van Damme is at its best (Though its stil not good)This movie goes deeper than other Van Damme Flicks. People who say its boring probably bought this movie because they wanted to see Van Damme kick and punch his opponents to death.Alain Lefevre (Van Damme) joins the foreigner Legion after double-crossing some kind of Maffia guy. In the Legion he makes friends that include a black guy that joined the Legion so he could escape America and go to Africa, an addicted Gambler from the U.K. and a sissy that wanted to prove himself to his Parents in law. They will be followed during the events they have in the Legion.With a good dose of drama and Action, placed in beautiful settings, this movie provided me an entertaining 90 minutes. Its a shame that this movie didn't ended up in the theaters and Universal Soldier: The Return did. This movie is outstanding and without a doubt one of the best movies Van Damme has played in. Not only for Van Damme fans, but for everyone that loves a good movie.",

So it was with some trepidation that I watched &quot;Legionnaire&quot;. I had never previously watched a movie starring Jean-Claude van Damme, and I am no fan of martial arts movies. Would he mess it up with pointless anachronisms, a legionnaire/kick boxer? But I was happily surprised by this movie. All of the basic elements of a good Foreign Legion movie were present and the production values were first rate. The cast was strong, with all of the standard stereotypical misfits becoming Legionnaires with the Legion's &quot;Marche ou creve&quot; spirit. This film is by no means movie as great art, but it's solid, well done and entertaining. Movie as comfort food. I loved it.",

Some of the characters have some tired dialogue about being presecuted, but that aside the actors fit their roles. Overall the movie ranks among one of Van Dammes better emotional roles.

    "review/text": "This movie definately deserves more credit than it has been given in other reviews. I usually cannot stand Van Damme, but my wife told me this was a good movie (she saw it on cable). I rented it, and liked it alot. This movie seemed to be loosely based an out of print 1977 movie called &quot;march or die&quot;. This one is better.Van damme tries to double-cross some french gangster, and blows it horribly. His only alternative to being murdered is to join the Foreign Legion.He winds up in North Africa, along with a bunch of other undesirables. The Legion is assigned to protecting french interests in that region. If you know your history of the French Foreign Legion, you will know that they always seemed to get the short end of the stick when it came to combat. This movie is pretty historically accurate in this sense. The legionnaires are outnumbered, poorly supplied, and isolated. As you can expect, they get whupped, pretty bad, too (just like real life). No BS here. No cavalry riding in to save the day, or some herculean feat which thwarts the enemy. They fight a losing battle, and are killed to the last man.The cinematgraphy is excellent. The on-location shooting lends favorable credibilty to this movie. The uniforms, weapons, and settings provide real authenticity. Van Dammes' accent (which usually irritates me) blends in with this movie suprisingly well. Since the Foreign legion is replete with, well, foreigners, his accent goes well with the other german, english, and italian accents one would expect from such an entity. The dialogue is also well written. It can get a little mushy and mopey, but it does not detract from the overall film. I would sum this up as a war/romance movie. this is definately NOT the typical Van Damme flick. Those of you looking for his typical stuff (karate/action), will be sorely dissapointed. Some military enthusiasts will like the authenticity. My wife liked it, and she hates Van Damme, so even the female counterparts will like it. I grudgingly have to admit that Van Damme suprised me with his acting ability. He is still no Cary Grant, but I can look at him in a new light with more respect. He did a pretty good job in this movie. I would have to rate this as one of my favorite movies. It is just plain good overall.Oh, by the way, to the person who wrote the previous review about him wielding a gatlin gun, and firing it standing up: do your research. He is firing a Lewis machine gun. It was developed by American inventor Sam Lewis prior to the First World War. While adopted in the US in only limited numbers, the Lewis gun was adopted as standard issue in the British, Belgian, and French armies and continued to serve in a limited number in the Second World War. It only weighs 27 pounds, and is quite portable, as depicted in Legionnaire.Enjoy the movie!",

It's one of the best Foreign Legion flicks around, and if its a bit short on plot it more than makes up for it with some very solid action sequences. Van Damme plays a 1920s boxer excaping to the Legion after double-crossing a crooked boxing promoter and losing his girlfriend in the process. The very-overated \"Beau Geste,\" by comparison, is definitely a better story-line, but Gary Cooper was way too old to play the title role and he's too wooden. Admittedly, Van Damme might not win an Oscar but he does a very good job as part of a solid ensemble cast of lesser-known actors playing the usual riff-raff joining the FFL: a black America, an Italian, a German, and a mysterious Englishman. Overall, see this one and \"March or Die,\" with Gene Hackman. It, too, has some great action sequences. \"Legionnaire\" is a good movie!",

    "review/text": "This is one the best Legion movies to come out in recent years. A straight-forward plot sets the action in motion. I must confess to not being a Van Damme fan, and actually knew little about him before this film, but I give him credit for a good job here. In fact he seems to have co-produced it which I also appluad. He gives a solid performance combining humor with pathos and sadness. The film provides a realistic view of the Legion during the murderous Riff Wars of the 1920s. This was just after WW1 and France was hard-pressed to hold onto her Algerian colonies. The movie accurately portrays the brutal atmosphere of the Legion from training to combat. The harshness of life, the tough NCOs and the inadequate officers who indifferently lead the Legion are all well shown. One can almost say that this is a modern re-make of BEAU GESTE, but it also combines elements of MARCH OR DIE as well. Still, there is enough here that is original and allows LEGIONAIRE to stand on its own with those two earlier classics. The film movies quickly and is handsomely produced. Fans of the Legion will surely enjoy, and those use to Van Damme in a different kind of film may be intriqued as well. No doubt the only Legion film we may see for a while it follows in the tradition of that genre. Recommended.",

Van Damme plays Alain, a fugitive boxer who signs up with the Legion as a way of escape from gangsters. This all happens within the first 10 or so minutes. The large bulk of the film has Alain befriending his fellow legionnaires and learning the values of friendship even in a time of war. True, this movie is rather predictable and many of the characters seem cliche, but the cinematography, score and (surprisingly) acting are all above average. Even Van Damme pulls off a convincing performance, proving that when he's given a good script, he can be believable. The reason this $40 million film was never released in theaters was because of its downbeat ending. Don't be fooled by its direct-to-video nature, though. This is a good one for the war/action fan.",

There are others there. Fagin teaches Oliver a new game. Nancy Sikes meets Oliver. A man's pocket is picked and Oliver is blamed! Cleared, Oliver is brought to a new home. Fagin wants to know what happened. Bill Sikes arrives with Nancy. Oliver has a new home with Mr. Brownlow. He is given the job of returning books, but is found by Nancy and taken back to Fagin. Nancy returns the books and money to Rose with an explanation.Fagin buys \"used goods\". There is a plan for a burglary, they need a small boy. Bill Sikes carries a small pistol. Oliver will be pushed through a small window to open the front door. Something goes wrong! \"Why its Oliver!\" Fagin has something from Oliver's mother for which he expects a lot of money. Nancy meets Rose and her uncle to tell them the news. Is she watched? Charlie Bates reports to Fagin, who tells Bill about Nancy. \"Crafty.\" Bill beats Nancy with a club. Now he is wanted and can be identified by his dog. Fagin was caught. Bill seeks a refuge with Fagin's boys. A crowd gathers outside in front of the house. Bill gets a rope to escape down the back wall. The Watch breaks into their room but Bill escapes them! Fagin sends for Oliver Twist and gives him that ring. Oliver shows Mr. Brownlow that ring, which identifies his parents (relatives of Rose and her uncle). Will Fagin be forgiven? Oliver will now be raised as a gentleman.I never read the book but know the story. This is a simplified and condensed version, which tells of life in the early 19th century. Are things different today? When did they change and why? This movie was made during the Great Depression so the audience would have better understood the poverty shown in this movie. This movie omitted the plot to deprive Oliver of his inheritance by a relative who knew of his existence and tried to get him involved in crimes.",

Naturally the cat scraps with Bill Sike's dog Bullseye, providing a comedic break.Other than being somewhat disappointed/annoyed by the lack of \"color\" in Fagin's voice, I found this thoroughly entertaining. It follows the book quite well for a 90 min. version. It is for the young set, grades K-1 to 5-6.It will be more palatable to many families than the G rated Broadway film, Oliver Twist, The Musical. The latter is more touching, heartbreaking, and real for some sensitive youngsters. It is over the top wonderful for all... except ages 0-7 or 8.Addl Note---My copy says 1973 on the back.",

Unlike most sitcoms, which seem to take really unrealistic characters and throw them into unrealistic situations, Raymond works taking a normal situation and exaggerating it to show the humor. I pull these DVDs out whenever I need a laugh. They're well worth the cost.",

Everybody Loves Raymond is really a timeless family comedy, and we can watch the shows many times over without getting tired of them.

    "review/text": "A welcome throwback to the days of scaled-down, DIY shot -on-video horror in the woods like Savage Harvest, Summer People is that rarity in indie horror, a slow burner that takes its time to build atmosphere, characters, and creeping dread rather than assaulting the viewer from frame one with jackhammer effects and editing. This debut feature for director Scott Feinblatt follows four kids as they venture out into the boonies to stay at a remote cabin, and the local townspeople don't seem entirely comfortable with these \"summer people\" stirring up trouble in their neck of the woods.Before you can growl \"I'll swallow your soul,\" the idiots are dabbling around in black magic, unaware that Native American spirits control the land and are still coexisting harmoniously (more or less) with the residents. Freaky little events like rearranging furniture set everyone on edge, and then things... start to turn nasty. Though obviously shot on the cheap (most daylight scenes rely entirely on natural light) and reliant on the most familiar plot in the horror handbook, Summer People distinguishes itself with solid performances by the leads (especially Neil Kubath, who could be an indie actor to watch), some surprisingly ambitious shocks in the second half, a creepy downbeat ending, and the aforementioned confidence to rely on story and pacing instead of pure sensationalism. Ah, and there's an animated opening and closing, too!The DVD is presented in anamorphic widescreen, looking about as good as it could. Extras include a handful of deleted (basically just expanded) scenes with some additional exposition, a funny 15-minute collection of behind-the-scenes footage (most memorable for accounts of the director's accidental double entendres and an impromptu trip to WalMart), and galleries of special effects make-up, stills, and storyboards.Originally posted by Nathanial Thompson at [...]",

Through miniscule changes in timing, we witnessed a domino effect that ended each vignette drastically different. Have you ever narrowly missed being in a car crash? What if you had dropped your keys getting into the car, adding several seconds that would eventually cause your course to parallel anothers and converge in an auto accident. In the film, we see snap shots of others lives as Lola runs past, the kid on the bike crashes, meets a nurse, they marry, they live happily ever after. Another vignettte, he doesn't crash, and winds up a junkie. In my humble opinion this is the best movie I have ever seen that was able to illustrate how each day our smallest deterances and decisions and those of others, can re-route the course of things and ultimately change the course of our lives.",

The soundtrack's perfectly done also--and this from someone who, as a rule, violently dislikes industrial techno.

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt) is one of the best European Alternative films to come out of the past decade. Directed and written by the great Tom Tykwer and starring Franka Potente (born exactly 10 years after me) this film starts out with a clock. You sense you are about to go on a time trip, and soon you're in the race against time. Incredible avant-garde cinematography mixed perfectly with cartoon animation focuses on Lola, a red-haired high energy time vortex. She has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 marks all in the name of love. If things dont go quite right it's okay, because here alternate reality comes into play ala the great Polish film Blind Chance (Przypadek by Kieslowski). Profound questions are asked, and the film puts forth the idea that a butterfly (Lola) flapping its wings in Japan will effect American weather. The quantum pure spontaneity of conscious decisions effect events at every Lola turn.A great soundtrack drives it all and the whole film fits together perfectly. A rare avant-garde success which is similar to and every equal of Aronofsky's Pi in significance. Also captures the Berlin (I think that's where it is) atmosphere great; city chaos and freedom. You must have a taste for the underground European avant-garde to really appreciate this.",

However, it would be impossible to explain the concept without giving away any of the fun, so I will keep quiet. But I can guarentee that it is nothing like yo have ever seen before and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. The concept and the direction in which the movie goes is fairly ingenious and the combination of the soundtrack and the visuals makes for a fast paced roller coaster ride.

The lead role, Lola, spends the film trying to get money owed to the German mob to her boyfriend, but she runs (literally) into problems the whole way. This is why the film is in three parts - each part is a &quot;do-over&quot; of the previous part. If only real life was like this! As a neat bonus, whenever she passes folks up on the street, small glimpses into their future are shown through Polaroid snapshots. Run Lola Run is certainly one of the better films out of Germany lately. The included music video is pretty cool as well. Don't pass it up.",

It's clever, funny and moving, and it's use of photographs to show the future of various minor characters is like nothing I've seen before.What I would recommend though is you watch it with the subtitles activated rather than listen to the terrible english dubbing. The voice actors are particularly wooden and you lose something of the characters' appeal in listening to them. I know subtitles can be a pain but it's worth the effort to hear Lola's real voice, when she isn't running that is!",

    "review/text": "Two lovers are caught in a bad situation to say the least, Manni (Moritz Blebibtreu) calls his girlfriend Lola (Franka Potente, \"Blow\") and says he's gonna be killed by a mob boss if he doesn't come up with 100,000 marks very soon (20 minutes in fact). He begs Lola for help and says if she can't help him he's going to rob a supermarket to get the money to save his life. Panicked and frantic Lola takes off running out of her apartment to help Manni, what follows is 3 different showings of Lola's sprint to save Manni by getting this money.Each situation shows how little things can either delay or help someone get somewhere faster, like not tripping over someone on a sidewalk, catching a casino at just the right time to gamble and win said money, so okay its more like just a game of chance and with her boyfriends impending death Lola feels the compulsion to do whatever she can to help. Each showing of her run has little differences to it and the first two don't end well for obvious reason (what need would there be to show the next one if the first or second one ends with everyone happy).Between the pursuits are some drama scenes with Manni and Lola talking that are decent but the film really shines during the running scenes. There's a pulse-pounding German techno soundtrack during most of the movie which does get the adrenaline pumping and I personally enjoyed looking at Franka as she's quite stunning and gives a good performance here (though she would go on to do better movies after this).This flick is a perfect example though of style over substance and the 81 minute running time is just right as any more would've made the experience tiring in my opinion. If it was rated on plot it wouldn't score much above average, but as a fun and fast film its quite entertaining and thats all this movie could've hoped to be. ***1/2 out of 4 stars, simply as a fun experience.",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run is the type of frenzied arthouse picture that just doesn't get made here in North America. That's really a shame because Run Lola Run is definitley one of the best movies of the year. From a cinematic point of view &quot;Lola&quot; is one of the most creative and energetic films that I have ever seen.The plot revolves around Lola, a woman who has twenty minutes to save her boyfriend's life from German gangsters. To do this she must miraculously acquire 100,000 Marks.The film is appropriately titled as Lola really does run for practically the entire film. When she does not succeed in saving her boyfriend the movie cuts back to the opening sequence and the film plays out yet again in an entirely different fashion. The central idea is that small variations in behaviour can change the entire outcome of a situation. This idea was also explored in &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;, unfortunately, with far more mixed results.Eventually the cycle repeats itself three times over the movies one hour twenty minute screen time. Run Lola Run is just bubbling with creative ideas and really is a stunning ride. The action never really lets up (except in a brief bed scene) and is filmed in the kind of frenetic, crazy style that MTV would be proud of. Lola is also extremely funny in many parts especially when the film briefly delves into the future's of various small characters.This is a perfect little film that stands up to repeated viewings. It is smart, entertaining and is something that is completely unique. Hollywood movies rarely have those three qualities, this German one does.",

    "review/text": "Catch this superb German film before Hollywood decides to remake it (and believe me, they will). This is cinema in its purest, most kinetic form.The plot is simple: Lola has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 marks that her boyfriend Manni owes to drug dealers, otherwise he's going to have to rob a store to get it. And that's it, basically. Only, ingeniously, we are treated to 3 versions of her run (or perhaps alternative universes), events unfolding differently depending on how long it takes her and the choices she makes. The attention to detail is stunning, and every little image and incident is relevant to the taut plotting. A wonderfully choreographed study of time and space.What we have is a kind of Sliding Doors (or Fowles' French Lieutenant's Woman) meets Pulp Fiction with all the energy and modernity of Trainspotting, mixing drama, tragedy and dark humour. Run Lola Run is a whirlwind race against time as our flame-haired heroine pounds the sidewalks of Berlin, unknowingly initiating traffic accidents, bank heists, uncovering dark family secrets, and changing the lives of the people she encounters on her way (beautifully executed in a series of Polaroid montages) in a complex web of cause and effect.Furiously paced, and edited, Twyker's masterpiece of Chance bombards us with an entire catalogue of camera tricks, techniques and mediums; split screen, time lapse, animation (in the cartoon sense), anything to grab our attention and immerse us in the situation, and is enhance by an excellent techno soundtrack (composed by Twyker).Presented on DVD with a decent extras package, Run Lola Run is a rush - in every sense of the word - from start to finish. (Watch it in German with the English subtitles, however, as the dubbed English soundtrack is dire.)",

You really have to pay attention during the movie and suspend disbelief for a while to really enjoy this one.The quality of the DVD transfer is very good. The picture is great, and the sound is outstanding (the film has a good heavy soundtrack). The extras on the disc aren't too exciting, but it is nice to have both German/English language tracks as well as English/French/None subtitles. I thought the english dubbing was done exceptionally well (except for the first scene).One interesting thing to note is that it is a double sided DVD, with the fullscreen version on one side and the widescreen version on the other side. There is no label on the DVD... only very very tiny print on the innermost rim of the disc. You have to have some good eyes to read it.I highly recommend this movie. But get it on DVD.

    "review/text": "If you think that Lara Croft is the quintessential action star, then you obviously haven't met Lola. &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is a masterpiece of action filmmaking that I loved. It is one of the best films of the year, and I will definitely buy it when it comes out on video. The film opens with a policeman/referee explaining the rules of a game. He dropkicks a soccer ball into the atmosphere, and the game begins with the ring of a telephone. Lola answers to find out that her boyfriend, Manni, is in trouble. He has left 100,000 marks on a subway train that has fallen into the hands of a homeless man. If he cannot get the money to the gangster he owes it to in twenty minutes, he will attempt a desperate, ill-fated robbery in order to keep from beng killed. With a scream from her throat and a toss of the bright red phone receiver, Lola is on the run, leaving her flame-red hair, her quick feet, and a pulsing techno soundtrack to carry the film the rest of the way. It is when she begins to run that I sat forward, eagerly awaiting the outcomes of her three separate journeys. Yes, Lola's odyssey transpires three times, each with a different outcome, and all because of one boy and his riled dog. Most of the film's elements remain the same: Lola meets the same people, runs under the same El-Train and always busts into her father's office at the bank while he's in the middle of a heart-to-heart talk with his mistress. As Lola meets the same people on the street, their lives are flashed before us in a series of snapshots, showing the different outcomes, all based on Lola's timing. Franka Potente plays Lola with the sort of perfect performance that most actresses wish they could pull off. Her screams always seem real and heartfelt, her tears in the confrontation with her father are real, and look of intensity that remains on Lola's face while she's on the run shows a very clear message: That Lola is a woman in love, and a woman on a mission. A mission that will be accompished at all costs. &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is not only the best action film ever made, it is also one of my all-time favorites, and it sets a new standard that no one will be able to surpass.",

Emotionally, one feels immediate affinity and sympathy to the lead characters and their situation, the humor is seamlessly infused in the film (read: no jokes or comedic cliches, yet it WORKS!), and the powerful bond between Lola and Manni is very subtle, but very stated at the same time. If only for its sheer novelty and refreshing nature, I believe this film will be one that will be remembered in this century's movie history for its perfection in combining universal themes, visual and aural cinematic elements, classic film formulas, and, well, innovation!",

    "review/text": "This is clearly one of the most creative films I have ever seen. It was a huge hit at the 1998 Toronto Film Festival and at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival and well deserves every award it won. In German, with English subtitles, this is a wild and exciting fast-paced movie that cannot be neatly assigned to a type or genre. Starring Franka Potente as Lola, her unique screen presence defined by her strong body, engaging tattoos and raggedy orange hair, she has a mere 20 minutes to get a large amount of money to her boyfriend so that he won't be killed by the mob. Instead of just showing us one of Lola's approaches, the film gives us three choices, and packs a strong punch with its theme of fate and destiny and how one tiny little move can effect not only the main characters, but also everyone around them. You can literally pick your own ending, each one packed with excitement and ironies.Most of the film shows Lola running, and as she passes by the same bystanders, their lives are changed in long-ranging ways. The pace of this movie is fast and is a mere 81 minutes long and it didn't lag for one single moment. As a matter of fact, I didn't want to take my eyes off the screen because I didn't want to miss anything. The soundtrack is perfect to accompany all the running, and the director, Tom Tykwer, uses a great mix of animation, still photography, slow motion and some very unusual camera shots. Never, once, however did the film sink into just a palette for showing off his artistry. The story and the characters were foremost and the audience is held captive, their hearts beating, as they join Lola in her run. Recommended. Don't miss it!",

    "review/text": "I'll just cut to the chase. It's in German, it's subtitled, and you'll do yourself a disservice by not reading on. Run Lola Run is the hippest, most original thriller since The Matrix.Remember how everyone, including myself, was so amazed by the fact that 1999's hit The Blair Witch Project cost so little to make? Here's another fact: Germans, like most Europeans, have never had the luxury of a big budget. Indeed, the reason they don't make films like The Matrix is because they can't afford to. The other side of the coin is that they have learned to be exceptionally inventive. It's a shame their movies don't have much of an audience here, and I generally believe that subtitles are a problem. Ironically, Hollywood makes half it's money overseas, and in all non-English speaking territories, our movies are dubbed. That's why you can listen to a DVD movie in French or Spanish, if you care to. These are simply the soundtracks from the foreign releases.Luckily for us, Run Lola Run is almost entirely a visual experience, with a storyline so simple that complex dialog isn't necessary. The throbbing techno-industrial music is a key to the enjoyment of the movie, but these sounds are universal.How's this for simple? Lola gets a phone call from her boyfriend, Manni. A drug deal has gone horribly wrong [I won't tell you how!], and if she doesn't get a large sum of money to him in twenty minutes, he's a dead man. So Lola runs - literally - to try and get the money. In a plot device so clever you will simply have to see it for yourself, Lola gets not one but three tries of twenty minutes each to successfully complete her task. Each attempt starts out in exactly the same way, but because of the way small things occur as she is running down the stairway of her apartment building, there are three different outcomes. All of them are startling and unexpected. It is left to each viewer to decide which outcome they prefer.The acting is uniformly excellent, from the two leads down to the smallest roles. As Lola, Franica Potente has an intensity and an energy level that is almost exhausting. Of course, she must have run a thousand or so miles to prepare for this very physical role. Moritz Bleibtreu is perfect as Manni. He is utterly believable as a guy who gets himself in a situation which is at once scary, because if the consequences and hilarious, because it is caused by the silliest of mistakes.Writer and director Tom Tykwer is a major new force behind the camera. Like many Europeans before him, the success of this movie may lure him to the bright lights and big budgets of Hollywood. Even if he refuses the call, which might be a wise decision, his is the kind of inventive moviemaking that will be copied over and over again anyway. And why not? Herr Tykwer's cinematic tricks are well worth repeating.",

    "review/text": "A kinetic, music driven sprint throught the most intense 20 minutes of one young life... times 3. The cinematography is astounding, some of the visuals in this film are gripping not only because of the lovely young Franka Potente but also the way the camera captures the pure primal energy of her considerably well-shaped body in motion. Not overly heavy on plot or opportunity for outstanding acting as a whole this film doesn't lack at all in visual and auditory appeal. What story their is present is perfectly understated for the purpose of the overall movie, and the scenes that develop the main characters and their emotional motivations are well handled in both the direction of Tom Tykwer and the acting of Potente and Bleibtreu. All in all I would give the film 4.5 stars, but I rounded up for the sake of this review.",

    "review/text": "In Short: One of the year's very best films - and Tristar has put together an excellent DVD.The Movie:I was stunned from the first minute and 81 minutes later, I'm still exhilarated. &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is a wildly stylish German thriller that takes the visual thrills that were presented in this year's &quot;Go&quot; and takes that kind of energy down to the essentials. From the opening frame, the movie never stops. Music pounds away, urging it onward to an almost unreal pace.The plot is simple and we're thrown into it from the very begining - Lola (Franka Portente) recieves a call from her boyfriend Manni that he lost a bag with 100,000 marks that he was supposed to deliver. If he doesn't come up with the money in 20 minutes, he's dead. The movie screams at you; throws almost every trick in the book at you, even shows sequences as cartoons.And so Lola begins her run - faster and faster, with an incredibly surreal and wonderful style cutting the pieces together. When Lola bumps into someone, we see (via snapshots) what happened to that person after she bumped into them. Potente makes a fantastic lead actress - there is an urgency in every word, every emotion, that makes us want her to win in the end. The story has alternate versions of what could happen as it spins around on itself, thrusting forward yet again. &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is unlike anything I've ever seen - it's a rush of energy unlike anything in film in the past couple of years, and I think it's really one of the best films of 1999.The DVDVIDEO: Tristar does it again - a fantastic looking anamorphic transfer letterboxed at 1.85:1 that has wonderfully clear images and displays excellent detail. Some of the movie was shot on different film mediums and although they don't look quite as sharp, they still remain strong. The movie has a fairly pale color palette, with the exception a flare of bright color that pops up, mainly of Lola's bright red hair, which looks vibrant and rich as she speeds throughout the city. Although the movie flies by, the picture is sharp enough to appreciate the architecture of Berlin, even if only for a passing moment.There really aren't any flaws to speak of that I saw - this is an incredibly clear and sharp looking image with no shimmering or other similar problems. Aside from maybe one or two very tiny marks on the print, this is a beautiful looking transfer. Fantastic work from Tristar. A full-frame edition is also included on the flip side.SOUND One of the main elements of the movie is the pounding techno soundtrack and it's also the main highlight of the sound mix, coming through wonderfully, sounding intense and dynamic, with good bass. There's also some very good uses of the surrounds on occasion. Both the German and English sound mixes are included and I found it kind of interesting to watch the English version and watch the subtitles to see what the original version is. Dialogue sounds clear in either language. Again, the music is really the highlight and it really powers the movie along.MENUS:: Stylish but non-animated menus that are easy to navigate.EXTRAS: Commentary: This is a commentary track from actress Franka Portente and director Tom Twyker. What I enjoyed most about listening to it was how much fun the two seemed to be having discussing the movie and how energetically they offered comments about the picture. It's really quite an interesting commentary and as I finished up watching the movie itself for the first time I was particularly excited to hear the two talk about how they made a lot of the movie.I definitely wasn't dissapointed. Although the commentary has a fairly relaxed feel, the two manage to discuss much of what I was looking for - the director offers a lot of particularly fascinating notes, mainly amount how a lot of the film's visual effects and camera tricks were achieved. He also talks about the importance of music in the picture and how the concepts for the film's music were brought to life. The actress talks a lot about how experiences in the film, mainly about how she had to run ...and run...and run. A lot of scenes of Lola running had to be shot more than once from more than one angle, exhausting for the actress. She also points out, along with the director, a lot of the German actors who star in the picture and their history. Some commentators spend too much time pointing out who's who in the film (such as the Farrelly Brothers on both of their commentaries) and thankfully, the two commentators don't do that here. In fact, I found a lot of the tidbits that were pointed out about the various actors to be quite interesting.Again, I really liked this commentary. The two are energetic and sound like they're having fun talking about the picture. This is my first time seeing the movie and I really found it highly enjoyable - I look forward to future films from both of them.Also: Music video, trailers for &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;, &quot;Orlando&quot; and &quot;Dreamlife Of Angels&quot; as well as talent/production notes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final Thoughts A must see.",

    "review/text": "One evening I found myself watching this movie on cable TV simply because there was nothing else on. Within 10 minutes, I was captivated and amazed at this film. It works on so many levels. It is totally European in its script, filming and overall look and feel. Now I am not necessarily a fan of European or Asian filmaking, but this movie goes a long way to opening my mind to the potential of foreign films. Which is not a bad thing, considering some of the dribble being made in the US of late.This is a moralistic tale, yet it gets the message across that the split-second decisions we all make in our lives set off a chain of events that can result in dismal and irreversible endings. But the film has fun doing it. One cannot help but be drawn in by the simplistic plot (and the basic plot itself is simplistic, though the various end scenarios are the height of creativity) and wondering what Lola is going to decide to do next.At times I found myself wanting to yell out \"dont' do that\" or \"Lola, no!\" which of course is ludicrous but signifies how wrapped up I became in the misadventures of this young German couple. I've not felt the urge to talk back to a silent screen since childhood, but this movie had me rooting all the way for Lola (even though there are serious crimes involved) and totally wrapped up in the basic story and its varied endings.I like the fact that this is a European film shot in Berlin and with a soundtrack composed of the type of music that people in Europe (but not necessarily here in the US) seem to enjoy. Even without any foreknowledge of the location, one knows immediately that this is NOT anywhere in North America. This aspect only adds to its appeal as one of its many attributes is to give us a glimpse into the European mindset, at times familiar but still distinct enough to generate interest.Kudos to the actress who, if not a marathon runner, should certainly consider becoming one. If she wasn't in great physical shape at the beginning of filming, she most assuredly was at its finish! I never realized that the very act of running could convey so much to the audience--we are constantly \"running\" all during our lives; not in a physical sense, but rather our movement on the road of life. We run to, or away from, different situations, but there is no escaping the fact that we must make important decisions and learn to live with our choices.This film rates 5 stars--I can find nothing wrong with it, and a lot that is right. Moralistic and entertaining at the same time, it reminds us that we are ultimately in charge of our destinies. We can chose to blame Fate, or a God or whatever we wish, but when all is said and done we have no one else to blame (or applaud) for the place in the universe we have carved out for ourselves.",

    "review/text": "I just watched this movie for a History of Cinema class, and I must say that it is one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life. Don't let the fact that it is a German movie throw you off; this is brilliant movie making to the extreme! A pulsating, non-stop action thriller, you will NEVER want this movie to end.Run Lola Run is an great example of the New Wave style of movie making; but while this movie is cinematically innovative, it's also incredible for its message: We are all just pawns in the game of life. The slightest, smallest thing can change the path of our lives completely; and this movie shows this message perfectly. Any fan of action films must watch this movie! And if you are thrown off by the fact that it's a foreign movie, the DVD also offers an option of English dubbing. The dubbing is hardly noticible after a while, and the action more than makes up for it. I must also say the the amazing techno music accompanies the action supurbly. Everything is edited around the music, and the results are awesome.Some of you may recognize the actress who plays Lola from the Bourne movies. She was amazing in those movies, but she is at her best here. She perfectly mixes action and drama, and is often very humerous as well. She helps to make this movie the great cinematic masterpiece that it is.Overall, I strongly suggest that you watch this movie. It is a terrific film, and you will be rivited from beginning to end.

    "review/summary": "Different outcomes but always the same fast pace",
    "review/text": "The teaser for this film is that, every second of every day, you come across a choice that can change your life. Tom Tykwer's film appears to show that, rather than the main protagonists making alternative decisions the whole time, their actions are more or less governed not just by other people's decisions and actions, but also by the timing of those decisions or actions.The plot centres around the girlfriend, Lola (Franka Potente), of a would-be gangster, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), who has to come up with a way of grabbing a whopping 100,000 marks (this was in the pre-euro days!) in just 20 minutes, otherwise the do-not-trust-anyone head of the mob, Ronnie (Heino Ferch), may do unspeakable things to him, if not give him a quick headbutt as he did for keeping a packet of fags from him once.One particular event, the theft of Lola's moped (shown as a flashback in monochrome), starts a chain of events, which will either see Ronnie get his money successfully or else see other outcomes. As a result, Manni, speaking in a desperate tone of voice from a phone booth, tells Lola that he will rob the nearest supermarket if she does not come within 20 minutes, preferably with the money.Three alternate scenarios, with three very different outcomes, are played out during this film, all of which are accompanied by a thumping, racing soundtrack composed by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek and director Tom Tykwer, as Lola runs, firstly, to a bank where her father (Herbert Knaup) just happens to be the bank manager, and lastly arrives at the intersection, where the phone booth and the supermarket are, by one means or another.Lola encounters characters who recur throughout the film, including Jutta Hansen (Nina Petri), who is Lola's father's mistress, Herr Schuster (Armin Rohde), who is the security guard at the bank, an old lady pushing a pram, whom Lola almost crashes into at exactly the same spot during her headlong dash to the bank, a young man who wants to sell her a bike he stole, and the tramp who managed to get hold of Manni's plastic bag containing the money he was given from the deal, which he had accidentally left on a Berlin subway train in panic at seeing two inspectors come into the car.Only one scene out of all three scenarios remains precisely the same, namely that of Lola's mother talking to a married man on the phone when Lola runs out of the flat at the start of the 20 minutes needed to get the money. Franka Potente is spared running down flights of stairs in the apartment building via the substitution of animation, first seen on Lola's mother's TV and then seen as part of the main story, although we do see (the live-action) Lola lying at the bottom of the stairs at one point after being deliberately tripped over by a young boy wearing a baseball cap, albeit in animation only.Not in any particular order, the scenarios include a bank robbery, a supermarket robbery, the same two cars involved in crashes, the moped thief crashing, Lola screaming, Lola almost being run over by an ambulance, Manni being actually run over by the same ambulance, the ambulance narrowly avoiding a huge piece of glass, the ambulance smashing the glass to smithereens, Lola being shot by a police officer, Lola doing her nut in her father's office, Lola being told to get away from the bank by an armed police response team, the security guard having heart problems ... and, as for the money, I will not say!Also, the characters of the old lady pushing the pram and the guy on the bicycle are shown in still \"flash forward\" pictures in rapid succession, accompanied on the soundtrack by the sound of a camera warming up before a flash picture is taken. Though they are minor characters, they are just as much affected by alternative events and outcomes as anybody else, so this is quite an interesting technique to show what happens to these people in the space of a few seconds of film running time.If you want to know which events come where, you will have to see this imaginative movie, which also contains two scenes where Lola and Manni are alone together, discussing how they really feel towards each other and what they would really do if particular situations were to occur. Each scene follows each of the first two scenarios and, though not at all action scenes with any music, they serve to help the audience realize that even the best of relationships may not be as solid as one might think at first.Tykwer has crafted a film that focuses very much on fate, not just determining one's own, but also having it determined by other people and events, both predictable and unpredictable. This is very much Franka Potente's movie, since it was the one which catapulted her to worldwide fame and a bourgeoning career as a Hollywood actress. I have heard both British English and American English soundtracks (as well as the original German!) yet only the DVD with the American English soundtrack also has the English commentary on the film by Potente and Tykwer. Here, Potente reveals that, one evening when it looked like it might rain, she had gone to a bar and met Tykwer, who would eventually cast her as Lola. Had it been raining that evening, she admits she might never have gone to that bar in the first place, so she never would have met Tykwer, so he never would have cast her as Lola, so she might never have eventually become famous and gone to Hollywood. Life imitating art, indeed!",

I saw the fancy cover art and thought it would be a short, inane film that wouldn't hold my interest. I was so incredibly wrong, and after I finished the film, I couldn't wait to go out and buy it. &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is sheer brilliance from start to finish, never letting your attention drift from the action on the screen. From the pounding techno soundtrack to the incredible camera angles and effects, the film is a wild ride to say the least.The plot involves the loss of 100,000 marks by a scatterbrained wanna-be crook named Manni who also happens to be the boyfriend of Lola. If Manni does not deliver the 100,000 marks to his gangster boss, Ronnie, in 20 minutes, Manni will be squashed like a bug. From here, the action begins. Lola frantically tries to replace the money for Manni, and she encounters many obstacles along the way. The most mind-blowing part of the movie is the alternate endings that show the various ways Lola must try to come up with the money.I was wondering how the filmmakers would stretch this film out to feature length, considering the plot begins and ends in 20 minutes, but they have done a masterful job of it. Simply put, &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is not to be missed, it is one of the best foreign films you will ever see!",

The story is told 3 different times, each one with a surprise twist ending. In addition, the director uses some excellent techniques. For example, when Lola interacts with another character, the director will sometimes follow that character for a bit. Often, he used a camcorder to film this, which resutls in an interesting effect. In addition, when Lola interacts with a character, the director often does &quot;And Then&quot;. &quot;And Then&quot; is when he quickly (in less than 15 seconds) tells what happens to that character by using a series of photos that each last on the screen for less than 1 second each. One woman that Lola runs into has three different &quot;And Then&quot; sequences, all of which are related to Lola but are very different. I really liked Sliding Doors, but this movie is much better.

I give it more credit than that (don't get me wrong - I love Groundhog Day!). In those cases the character was caught in the film's mystery, unable to break the time-warp spell and get on with their lives. Here, time breaks, shifts, bends, and cracks for one simple reason: because Lola wills it so. She wills herself a second chance to get Manni the money. She wills the spectacular (photo-captured) futures of the people she runs into on the street. She wills the money from her father. And in the final sequence at the casino, her will is put on it's most bare, full-throated display. Rarely have I been more satisfied with a cliched ending; it had to be that way, because that's what Lola wanted (and whatever Lola wants, Lola gets! Omigod! Is it all just a thinly veiled 'Damn Yankees' reference?)It borrows its schizophrenic style from 'Natural Born Killers', utilizing video, film, and cartoon, quick editing, disturbed camera angles, and even an oppressive musical soundtrack. I'm still trying to decide if the style added or subtracted from the narrative. I enjoyed the cartoon; thought it was perfectly edited; and never felt like I was watching the same scene over again because the style was unique for each pass. But there were times when the style got in the way, when it didn't add a thing to the narrative, and proved distracting. But those times were few enough for me to say that overall the style worked. And it was so fun, and kinetic, and riveting. Like an 85-minute music video, with a cohesive (albeit existential plot). You can't not pay attention to Lola.",

    "review/text": "This is one of the best films I have seen in a great long while. The cinematography is groundbreaking, the storyline is impossible to predict, and the sidelines to the story are great - both the bedroom conversations that describe Manni's true feelings toward his girlfriend, and thoughts about death, and the 10-second flashes into the lives of side characters and how those lives are affected by the decisions the main characters take. I suppose I would like this film less if I didn't also like techno, but even if you don't, this movie has just so much to offer, and is so amazingly different than the formula movies, that you have to see it. I'm one of those bastards in the movie theatre who tends to know what's about to happen before it actually does, and I almost spoke aloud, &quot;For crying out loud, it's only 20 minutes into the movie. It's not like the main character's going to die.&quot; WRONG! The plot twists are impossible to imagine before you see it. (And I'm not giving anything away, eitehr) Final note: My cousins visisted me (in San Francisco) from Germany, and said it was the best German film they had ever seen. That they ended up seeing it in America, in German with English subtitles, made it a bit surreal for them. But still, an outstanding film all the way around. I can't wait for more movies by this director.",

    "review/text": "A fantastic, hip, and energized look at a young woman (Lola, of course) who must raise 100,000 DM in 20 minutes before her boyfriend Manni, who has to answer to a gangster about a large sum of money that he mistakenly left on a train. Run Lola Run literally runs right from its MTV-inspired opening credits, using a striking mixture of incredible lighting, quick editing, and animation to give a unique feel to late 90s Berlin (it is also a somewhat more optimistic picture of Berlin than the Berlin of Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, which the film alludes to in its opening moments). The result is three different looks at what Lola's adventure might turn into. Fantastic on every level, the direction is both quickly-paced (perhaps a little too quick in parts) and yet never fails to involve the audience. All of the characters emerge into full people through each \"scenario.\" Incredible as it might sound, however, this film could have used some tighter editing, notably in the (rather trite, it must be admitted) scenes where we learn of Lola's father having an affair with a co-worker. I am unsure of what this subplot brings to the film other than a few laughs. As I said, the direction is tight and quick, but when the film slows, it slows for a reason, revealing character. Lola's flaming red hair will help you keep focused on her running when the camera segues to its aerial shots.",

The music (I have the soundtrack CD) is perfect, and the film is fast paced. It's a great watch on the treadmill and the score is a good jogging or skiing iPod addition.Franka Potente went on to the Borne movies (as well as many others), and while many people find her annoying, she's a good fit for Lola. Lola has three \"runs\" - basically three do-overs for the same events, and we see how each progresses and what she learns from them.It's a German movie, so there are a lot of cultural nods and references that foreigners would miss. The voice-over is by Hans Paetsch, a famous children's narrator. Famous German actors of yesteryear have cameos, and there are quotes and references attributed to other famous Germans (these were pointed out to me by a friend.)Because this is a foreign film, the photography style, editing, actors, etc. are different from what we're used to, and the ending is typically European. This only adds to the movie's attraction. If you like fast paced or off the wall movies, you'll thoroughly enjoy Lola.",

This should be a cute but shallow gimmick; instead, it is utilized with an unusual cleverness and purpose.I shan't give any of the twists or turns away; suffice to say that each &quot;new life&quot; actually reveals more about the characters and their motivations than I would ever had imagined.A exciting collage of media, Run Lola Run offers extreme entertainment with hints of unsuspected substance.",

    "review/text": "Although \"Run, Lola, Run\" is off-beat, has some nice camera work and a few impressive images, I could not develop any interest in any of the characters. Lola's extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top, white bra straps, turquoise pants, and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The \"driving music beat\" (or however it was described), was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time, which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here, but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie (\"Lost and Delirious\", \"The Smokers\", \"Black and White\" and \"Armageddon\"). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to...\"Run Away, Run\"",

Gen-somethings looking for a quintessential grrrl anti-heroine, need look no further than young Lola, mostly human, sometimes Toon, whose loyal heart and running stamina we cheer on even as we bemoan her poor judgment.

American movie critics seem to have a fetish for any movie foreign. Don't believe the hype...the plot is not ingenious nor are the direction and production groundbreaking. The basic idea (Lola has to come up with 100,000 bucks and get it to her distressed boyfriend Manni in 20 minutes or he will be killed) would have made for an exciting short film, but instead is stretched into an agonizing almost feature length film. The same story plays out three times, with three different endings. The premise is interesting (not original): how little, insignificant events drastically change the outcome of people's lives. But the film spends too little time exploring the idea and WAY too much time showing Lola running. There is NO character development. We don't care if Manni or Lola or anyone else dies or lives. The viewer has no vested emotional interest in the characters (unless you're sympathetic towards whining punk drug dealers who forget their drug money on subways). Cartoon animation, interesting polaroid segments, and a relentless techno soundtrack are added in a desperate attempt to keep the viewer interested in watching Lola run all over town.I don't get how Lola changes many lives in this film. There are only a few polaroid sequences that are directly affected by her presence.Lola gets one star for being in excellent cardiovascular shape, and another star for some interesting pillow talk sequences that give the movie its only interesting substance. Its worth a rent just to see what people have been talking about (Of course we have forgotten Lola and now love Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon...Although that is a way better film.)",

This movie is quite riveting, so much so, that it tempts the viewer to lose sight completely of the fact that nobody in this movie is even close to being a sympathetic figure. Lola seems to be running from: (choose up to three:) 1. the death that is contempary bourgeious existence 2. hypocrisy of modern family life 3. german collective past 4. soulless capitalism 5. the inescapable corporeality of bodily existence 6. awful techno soundtrack that follows her everywhere. 7. her father (perhaps the most reprehensible figure in the movie) 8. the cops. 9. Time and space (to keep the themes nice and specific.) I couldn't figure it out either and I guess that is because the movie doesn't really give anything by way of thematic development. We simply watch a girl run around wide Prussian streets (great for military parades) and wonder whether or not we should root for her to save her aspiring criminal boyfriend - presumably so that he can live to deal drugs to kids another day. The movie flips around and different things happen to the same people (movies are funny that way) and one leaves with no sense of anything but a desire not to dye my hair, go running that day or mess with Russian mobsters. Having said that, I would say that the movie is very fast paced and exciting. I just wish that the director would, well, direct his talents toward something more meaningful.",

Yes, it explores interesting philosophical issues (for example, Lola's question to her boyfriend: &quot;If I never existed, would you now be telling some other girl you loved her?&quot;). Yes, it is edited frenetically like a music video and shot in bright, fun colors like Gregg Araki's films. However, a premise + style is not enough to make this really memorable.The plot itself is rather weak. There are two categories of information in the story: factual stuff and hypothetical stuff. As far as facts go, all we know is that Lola's boyfriend owes some top gangster guy 100000 marks and needs it in 20 minutes or else he is certain the top gangster will kill him. In each of the three hypothetical sequences branching from this situation, Lola and her boyfriend disregard obvious possiblities.Manni, the boyfriend, claims that he cannot run from the deal because &quot;no one escapes&quot; from the top gangster guy. I found this frustrating because relying on the improbable appearance of 100000 marks within 20 minutes seems RIDICULOUS! Of course, it works out because this is a movie, not real life. But an intelligent person in real life would most likely not wait helplessly for his girlfriend to show up with money she doesn't have yet--and with his life at stake.There are other instances in which the characters are inexplicably dumb. For instance, Lola herself, though she is in such a hurry to get the money, stalls when she sees her father in the midst of an affair. Of course it is an emotional situation, but when someone's life is at risk, it seems she would not beat around the bush in asking for the cash.This does get slow at times because the audience gets used to all the fast editing, and it stops looking so special. In fact, by the end I felt it hadn't really been worth finishing, because there were no new revelations, no mind-blowing conclusion.Rather than address everything that made this implausible and hindered identification with either main character, I will recommend this film. Maybe skim through it or something, just to absorb the ideas. Good concept, poor story. &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, though more mainstream, was a better exploration of chance.",

In an ever-so European manner, the film is a combination of techno and artistic brilliance, leaving the viewer entranced. Franka is amazing.

Lola offers what the disappointing Magnolia failed to provide. Magnolia's problems were many among which were length, superfluous dialogue, and characters for whom I felt no sympathy. Lola, however, minimizes dialogue yet you are compelled to sympathize, and even root for, the otherwise despicable protagonists and the average bystanders whose time critical paths cross randomly. What if you hit the snooze button on your alarm just one more or one less time tomorrow morning? What will happen...or not? Will it be a joyous or fatal decision? Every moment is fleeting and life really is a roll on the roulette table, so enjoy it to the fullest. Take note Hollywood. Great filmmaking has nothing to do with big budgets. It starts with the script.",

On all of those levels, Run Lola Run works well. However, the story is another matter. I've read several reviews praising the different nuances, stylistically and story-wise, which change as the story runs each time. What I found was a crime-story version of the film Groundhog Day, or a more stylish version of an X-Files episode from several years ago titled `Monday', in which Mulder experienced the same botched bank robbery several times. Run Lola Run definitely wins on its style points, but on those points alone.",

I've watched it at least ten times. It convincingly proves that every action you take creates a ripple effect which affects the whole world. For the past ten years, every time something important happens to me I tell myself, That was a Lola moment. Lola runs past people on the street, and the director shows how her passing affects their lives differently (according to whether it's at 12:00, 12:01, or 12:02) by a quick-pace series of photographs of their lives, after this brief encounter. So owning this movie is a must because you'll want to keep replaying the quick series of photographs which show their possible futures, depending on the time of day she brushes past them. Simply amazing. Brilliant acting and incredible filming. Great music and cartoony special effects. People rave about the Butterfly Effect and Sliding Doors but these two don't come close.",

It follows Lola (Potente) as she races to get 100,000 deutschemarks for her boyfriend Manni (Bleibtreu) who is in debt to a seedy gangster with no patience or mercy. She has twenty minutes to do so and what makes this film unique is that it is very time conscious. Tom Tykwer accurately takes twenty minutes (or VERY close to) with each of Lola's attempts to save her boyfriend.Lola's first attempt is to ask her father, a bank manager, for the money. This goes horribly wrong and Lola is forced to take another route. She makes a few attempts, and each one explores cause and affect in a strange way, showing the outcomes of everyone involved and all whom Lola interacts with until the film ends unexpectedly.The camera style here is great, fast paced and edgy, and it keeps you glued to the screen until the credits begin to roll. I was also very impressed with the acting on the parts of the two leads, Franka Potente in particular who embraced her character with pure panic and conveyed a very convincing and realistic portrayal of a woman fighting for the life of her lover. I haven't seen too many foreign films but after this one I'm surely going to give them a try.",

    "review/text": "RUN LOLA RUN is one of those films that actually delivers what it promises. In this case, a heart-pumping, action-filled flick with an excellent soundtrack, and plenty of artistic weirdness to boot.Clocking in at a mere 80 minutes, this German-made film is infused with a quality normally seen in the cars this country produces. Tom Tykwer wrote the script and directs (as well as contributing his voice and music to several songs/remixes), and gives us a movie that contains more than just artsy material. He takes the viewer on a journey of existentialism thanks to the unusual abilities of its main character, Lola. She's a dye-dipped redhead with a high-pitched, soprano voice that can shatter glass. And she has the ability to change her future. Problem is, though, every time she changes something, everything changes, not just the one thing she wants. So when her boyfriend, Manni, loses 100,000 Deutsche marks that are owed to a local mob boss, Lola has to save him. But she's only got 20 minutes, and everything doesn't go as planned ...the first time. Or the second. Or maybe even the third.Not being very familiar with German cinema, I'd rarely watched anything from this country. But I'd often heard people comment on Run Lola Run and how great it was, so I decided to check it out. And I'm glad I did! The film opens up with a bang and doesn't stop until the final scene. Franka Potente stars as the hair-color-enhanced Lola, and her portrayal is believable, beautiful, and bizarre. In short, a great combination. Her boyfriend, Manni, is played by Moritz Bleibtreu, and his ridiculous behavior is pulled off well, especially when he loses the money and calls Lola in a blubbering panic.I loved, too, the incorporation of overlapping animation, something I enjoyed in the movie THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS.Connections within connections is the main theme here, but one that is brought to life by a vivid script and excellent camera work (the dizzying slow-downs and speed-ups may drive some to distraction but are vital to the story).I mentioned earlier the great soundtrack and that the director contributed his own voice and songs to it. And so did Franka Potente. The European beats mixed with old American titles were laid down in topnotch fashion.This is another foreign film gem, and one that won't take up much of your time. But it's one you'll be glad you visited.",

    "review/text": "Ever since MTV arrived on the scene back in the early 1980s, the attention span of Americans has dropped like a stone. The mindless superficiality of the programming hasn't helped boost IQ scores, either, but I won't get into that here. MTV's propensity for rapid-fire programming, replete with jump cuts and other fast editing techniques, eventually found a home in the moviemaking business. Unfortunately, the use of these methods became commonplace, often relegating if not downright replacing such tried and true formulas like plot, character development, and dialogue. Throw in a cut every few seconds, the reasoning must have went, and it gives the audience the impression that the action is more immediate and exciting. In more than a few cases these new techniques worked effectively, usually in films that still adhered to the old ideas of centering the film on the characters and the script. The first \"Matrix\" film comes to mind as an example of a movie that successfully fused the new editing with traditional film practices. Another film that works just as well is \"Run Lola Run,\" a low budget German film written and directed by Tom Tykwer and starring the amazing actress Franka Potente.The plot of \"Run Lola Run\" is surprisingly simple. Lola (Potente) must find a way to come up with 100,000 deutsche marks in twenty minutes or her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) will have some serious explaining to do. He took a job for a big time crime boss involving the sale of a bunch of stolen cars but accidentally left the money on the train. A bum stumbled over the bag of cash and walked off with it before Manni could stop him. If Lola can't find a way to replace the bag of money, Manni tells her on the telephone, he will go across the street and rob a supermarket. Losing the money is that serious of a matter, apparently. Twenty minutes. With no time to lose, Lola dashes out of her apartment and runs across town to see her banker father, hoping against hope that he will somehow loan her the money. Yeah right. This guy has his own worries involving a female employee and he isn't about to drop everything to help his troublesome daughter. Lola dashes on, but through circumstances beyond her control arrives too late to stop Manni from committing a robbery. Will tragedy ensue because of her tardiness? Will the crime lord arrive on the scene and bust her boyfriend up for his lackluster handling of the assignment?\"Run Lola Run\" answers these questions in different ways because once Lola arrives at the supermarket, the movie starts over at the point when she hangs up the phone after finding out about Manni's quandary. That's right, we see the same event begin again with a slightly different variation and outcome. Once again, Lola dashes across town to visit her recalcitrant father in order to beg him for a loan. Once again, her father is dealing with his own problems concerning a female employee. But the encounter between father and daughter is slightly changed. So is the ultimate outcome of the eventual Lola/Manni reconciliation. Then the film STARTS AGAIN at the point where Lola hangs up the phone after learning about Manni's predicament. Again, she dashes across town to visit her father in order to seek his assistance with the couple's fiscal problems. And again, her father is dealing with his own issues. And again, many events change from the previous versions. Three separate times Lola dashes across town to save her boyfriend, with the ending of each variation differing significantly from the previous version of events.\"Run Lola Run\" uses everything from animation to fast editing to a thundering soundtrack in order to create a sense of dire urgency, and it works spectacularly. You'll be sitting on the edge of your seat wondering how Lola will overcome the obstacles in her way, or even if she can overcome them. Tykwer gives the film additional depth by occasionally showing us, through a quick series of still photographs, what happens in the future to various people Lola runs into or passes by on her journey through town. A woman pushing a baby stroller and a lady walking down the hallway in the bank are just two examples of this interesting technique. Obviously, their fate changes in each version. The inclusion of intriguing concepts like this and others highlights the fickle connections between each living person on the planet. We've all thought along these lines before, usually when something disastrous happens and we say something like \"If I had only turned left instead of right, I wouldn't have wrecked my car.\" \"Run Lola Run\" simply poses this question on a larger scale by showing how an event could change based on one or two minor variations in the actions of a character. If the movie's existential ponderings prove too much for you, you can sit back and enjoy Franka Potente's performance as the grungy, red headed Lola. She's a real hoot, with a voice capable of shattering glass when she screams.Extras on the disc include an informative, fun commentary with Tykwer and Potente, a music video with a brunette Potente singing a song, cast biographies, and trailers for \"Run Lola Run,\" \"The Dreamlife of Angels,\" and \"Orlando.\" There are a few problems with the story, such as the nonsensical scene when the cops refuse to let Manni reenter the train to get his money. Why would they do that? Because the script needs that bag of money out of Manni's hands, that's why. Yet despite a few logical problems, \"Run Lola Run\" is a heck of a film everyone can enjoy.",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run A Review by Ashley McBrideIn this film, Lola is a very un-stereotypical heroine who undergoes three nearly identical episodes in which to save her lover Manny from his mob boss.The character of Lola critiques the Hollywood mainstream heroine in many ways. She is not a contrived Hollywood beauty. She has bright orange/red hair and punk clothing which offer a disassociative affect for the viewer, allowing them to critique the mainstream heroine and the priorities of Hollywood to alter her into a commodity rather than a true hero. She also has superhuman ability, first to alter outcomes (chaos theory) and second, to see into the future (snapshots). This also offers the viewer a chance to disassociate with her because she is unlike the viewer; though she seems real, is she? She is saving he. This is a main point because this allows the viewer to critique the \"damsel in distress\" role that females normally play. Lola takes control. This is prevalent especially when the exact translation of the German title is given \"Lola Runs.\" This title more accurately portrays Lola in control-a genuine hero who is motivated to succeed so much so that she risks her life in three episodes/ tries. Lola remains a hero the whole way through the film, unlike most mainstream Hollywood heroines. Though she is unable to help Manny (because he ends up helping himself) she still gets there on time with the money retrieved (in a legitimate manner) in the last episode. She tried, tried again, and then succeeded-which makes her the hero of the story.The cinematic effects of camera angle, cartooning, and electronic weaving all serve to disassociate the viewer from the film, in order to step back and critique it. This film is fun because it challenges society to co-produce instead of just take in a film.Lola is objectified throughout the film, but not in a Hollywood manner. She is usually shown as an entire woman-not as fragments of one (Lola is not a breast, a leg, etc.). Lola is the object of the panoptical gaze, but is unaffected in her cause. She runs not because she is told to and is being watched to ensure that she does, but runs because she wills herself to do so, and takes no care in anyone watching. This is proven when she robs a bank (laws do not matter) and goes into the casino with casual clothes (appearances do not matter). Thus Lola breaks the objectification by the panopticon set by institutions because she could care less that they exist. Even when her father tells her she does not look good she is unaffected in her cause and ignores the comment. This is just another way Lola as a hero breaks Hollywood mainstream heroines who care very much in rules and appearances and therefore are affected by the way in which they are being watched.Lola Runs!",

In this film, the viewers are confronted with a \"heroine\" that when not satisfied with the outcome, chooses to \"do-over\" her life, or only 20 minutes of her life. Lola is not the typical Hollywood heroin, always looking prim and proper; she gives off the more realistic side when confronted with an intense situation. Lola shows that the smallest decision can change everything from then on. Throughout the film, she takes on the so-called masculine role and takes action rather than crying and waiting for someone else to take charge. But when those 20 minutes are up, it seems as though her female lead crumbles and she once again takes the feminine role in the relationship. It seems questionable that her heroic attributes are only due to the framing and digital weaving of the film rather than the actual character. Overall, it was interesting to see a different side of femininity and the effects in which it had on the viewers.",

    "review/text": "In Tom Tykwer's film, Run Lola Run, we are confronted with a main character that struggles to find her place between the two distinctions of feminist and feminine. The film, which is segmented into three different scenarios, starts off by portraying Lola as a female hero. She breaks the stereotypes, and does not reflect the Hollywood ideal of a female heroine. Her clothes are ragged, her hair is a mess, and worst of all, she does not glisten but actually sweats. The Hollywood heroine, on the other hand, would be wearing high heels in all of the fight scenes, never break a sweat, and always be sexy and perfectly put together. The cinematic gaze, as refered to by film theorist, John Berger, depicts her as a super human action hero. She can see the future, run far distances in almost no time, and she has the power to change certain events in time. The cinematic gaze is usually used to objectify women. In Run Lola Run, however, it is used to set Lola apart, and show what a woman can be capable of. Tykwer's progressive feminist representation of Lola falls prey to stereotypical femininity in the last scenario. Mani, her small time crook of a boyfriend, whose life she is trying to save, comes through in the clutch. He does not even think of what Lola has gone through in an attempt to help him. Tywker ends the film with the man saving the day. This strays from his critique of \"the Hollywood heroine\" that had been a blaring message in the first two scenarios. All of Lola's efforts have been trivialized and she is shown as powerless and speechless. Mani acts as if he had the entire situation under control the entire time, and reduces Lola's role to that of merely a supportive and concerned girlfriend. The film ends with a segmented shot of Mani and Lola's interlocked hands. This is a perfect example of Foucault's idea of the micro physics of power. Ingeborg Majer O'Sickey includes this idea in her discussion of Barbie Magazine. It refers to the manner in which a body can be fragmented into discrete parts in order to display power. In this last scene in Run Lola Run, the fragmented shot of their clasped hands, turns Lola into a powerless and submissive girlfriend. She no longer is able to be defined independently. Mani does not need her, he simply has her a a trophy to be displayed. This movie shows us that as far as we think we are progressing as an equal society whith women who are respected, we have a lot of work to do.",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run is an interesting film about a girl and her boyfriend and their struggles to survive the most grueling twenty minutes of their lives. Manni, the boyfriend, somehow forgot 100,000 marks on a subway train and is in a lot of trouble unless Lola shows up with 100,000 marks to pay off the men Manni was supposed to meet. The movie plot is based around the chaos effect, which is the idea that every action one makes effects the lives of everyone else. The twenty minutes is shown in 3 different ways because each time it is restarted, Lola takes different paths in order to get Manni the money that he needs to stay alive.In a way, Lola is a panopticon during her struggle to find Manni's money. Manni is always watching over Lola, making sure that she gets to him on time. Lola knows this and will take any measure possible in order to get the 100,000 marks to Manni on time. Whether she has to lie, cheat, or steal, she will get the money. She acts under pressure and runs everywhere she goes just to keep Manni safe. Manni is depending on Lola to be the hero of the day and show up with what he needs.Lola plays the role of the strong independent woman during the movie. Manni is helplessly waiting for Lola to show up with the money. Lola shows her strengths by not being afraid to do anything in order to save the day. She'll rob her father's bank, she'll help rob a grocery store, and she'll take big risks in a casino just to save Manni. The story is played out three times in three different ways because of the chaos factor. Sadly, the movie ends with Manni saving himself because he finds the money himself. Lola is once again the stereotypical dependent woman. She struggles so much to get Manni the money he needs, but it turns out that he never needed her help at all. She accepts this fact and walks off with him as if nothing happened to her during the 20 minute struggle.",

From the second Lola throws down the phone the clock is ticking.The theory of this movie seems to be based on that everything we do (or don't do), every action effects someone. For good or bad. If she's a minute later - 30 seconds earlier - whatever - there is a different outcome. People that she runs into on the street - a pause in their actions... it changes their fate.She goes thru the day 3x. Different days for everyone.The way it's shot is somewhat different and reminds me vaguely of QTarantino's Kill Bill flicks. Just the openness of it - structually - not so much the dialogue.All in all a good movie.",

    "review/text": "An exhilarating fast-paced action movie from start to finish. This movie has excellent cinematography with a story that is as strong as the filming and the acting.Lola receives a phone call from her wanna-be crook boyfriend, Manni. He complains to her that because she was late from picking him up, he mistakenly lost 100,000 deutsche marks meant to be given to Ronni, a big-time crook. If Ronni does not receive his 100,000 deutche marks within 20 minutes, he will kill Manni. This phone call starts this movie on an action-packed, fast-paced movie where Lola tries to get his money and catch up with Manni before it is too late.Tom Tykwer does an excellent job at showing us what cause and effect really means. He shows Lola bumping into people on her way to Manni, and how life for that individual turns out with a show of photographs.There is even an animation part where Lola's mother is talking on the phone while her television is on, and on the TV is an animated Lola running down the stairs of their apartment to get outside, as she is actually doing it.Tom Tykwer keeps you visually stimulated, as well as audibly intrigued with the background tech music.The acting by Franka Potente is great. She actively portrays a girlfriend distressed that her boyfriend may be killed, yet determined to do what she can to prevent this. Franka Potente has recently been seen in an American blockbuster, The Bourne Identity with Matt Damon.Moritz Bleibtreu also does a great job being a not-too-smart crook. He does a great job portraying how desperate his character is when he calls Lola.This movie is pretty interesting, as the movie is the whole 20 minutes it takes for Lola to try to figure out how to come up with that kind of money, as well as the obstacles she encounters along the way. So, as you may wonder, as I did, how can a feature-length movie drag 20 minutes out to be so long? Well, the first time through...yes, you read that right, the ending is not what Lola wanted, so the movie starts over again, and this time when she encounters her obstacles, she handles them differently, until the next outcome happens. In the end, we see her try three times to get to Manni in time.This IS a must-see movie. It is one of the best movies out at this time, and you will want to see this, as you know Hollywood will be doing a re-make on this in the future!",

    "review/text": "The theme of this movie is primarily philosophical. Don't be put off, it isn't at all hard to understand and its far from boring. The idea is like the butterfly effect. One miniscule change will gernerally lead to huge differences. This may remind you of &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;, a movie which took the same theme and portrayed it in a very different way which I found rather disapointing.The other theme is the techno music and action (running) which makes this come off a bit like a music video. I found the music very good and the vocals complemented it nicely. The important thing is how well it works with the visual imagery and I found it did that very well. In fact, if I had a treadmill I'd buy the soundtrack to this movie and run to it. Someone told me the actress who played Lola and the director wrote and sang all the music together. I can't confirm this, its just something I heard. If so, wow. Muchos kudos and afterlife points to them.The final theme is the plot, which keeps you interested. Its a simple plot. Lola must come up with 100 thousand marks and get it to her boyfriend in 20 minutes.While it would seem action techno and philosophy are quite different, they are put together with amazing success in this film from Germany. I recommend this movie to people who like unique, thought provoking, fun filled movies.Oh one final warning: if you can't read, you may have trouble understanding this film, unless you speak German. Let all those who can't read be forwarned.",

If you have any friends that you want to introduce to foreign films, this would be a great one for them to start with, even if they are a little resistant to the idea of reading a film. Besides the brilliant and highly athletic performance from Franka Potente, who has since gone one to make many well-known films in the U.S., \"Run Lola Run\" also boasts excellent editing, a great visual style and of course, a really catchy German techno soundtrack. I just read a review on here that suggested there should be an American version made, and I'm all for that, if it's done well. I would agree with having Scarlett Johansen play Lola, too.

I wonder if the creators of this film ever studied the writings of Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, Orage, or John Godolphin Bennett - because it is right out of the &quot;eternal return&quot; concept that is talked about by people involved in &quot;4TH Way Work&quot;. The mythic and archetypal meanings hit you right in the face: POW! ... There is no escape from the contemplation of the &quot;ultimate questions of our lives&quot; when watching this movie. The synchronicity is UNBELIEVABLE!... It is a living legominism of higher art, embodying the three octaves of the enneagram in a way that REALLY makes you see how one - with extra effort - can actually CHANGE THE FUTURE! ... The scenes where Lola and her boyfriend are relaxing in bed, intimately discussing their relationship, are very moving. The viewer instanly realizes just how much these two people truly love and care for one another. I was moved in a big way.... I watched this film THREE times. Each time I watched it, I learned more not only about the film itself, but about the deeper meaning of life as well. It will teach you a good lesson: NEVER succumb to the sleeping negativity of negative emotions or actions - even for a second - if you want to stay awake and have your life stay buzzing in the more centered and finer vibrations of &quot;the higher octave.&quot; ... This one is a true classic! And - by all means - watch the original one in the German language with English subtitles. There's nothing like the real thing! - The Aeolian Kid",

Since I was stationed in Germany for six years with the U.S. Army and had a few German friends who would occasionally visit me, I was always looking for good German-language films. Belonging to a family of people who appreciate films, I knew the major classics of the German Expressionist period and the Sternberg-Dietrich collaborations, but I needed something newer to keep young German friends interested.Run Lola Run is very showy, but it lacks depth. Now, I don't disagree with other people who like this movie very much--the last thing I want is for people to think of me as hostile--but needs something to care about--a reason to exist--where the zippy photography and inter-cut animated segments would ultimately mean something. Run Lola Run seems to me to be a very shallow film. Except for this, the film was very good. The film is successful at adapting a certain aura of contemporary German society, the same side that, like many of us Americans, watch a lot of daytime television; I only intend a deduction.As always, I recommend the following German films: Rosenstrasse, Das Boot, Wings of Desire, and Faraway so Close.",

    "review/text": "This DVD has been reviewed nearly 500 times so there's not too much that you can say that hasn't been said. One repeating theme is the movie's comparison to the \"investment projects\" of Hollywood. That Hollywood has the best technique, stars, cinematography, $s, and gimmicks is all true. What it often doesn't have is that sense of taking a chance. Lola does.The presence of a basic problem, lovers on a downward spiral, need not be examined. The consequences of THE ACT is ignored and in its place is the examination of the details of the turns and twists we make each day which brings us to THE ACT.We probably cannot alter what has happened, Tykwer theorizes. But what occurs to Lola and Manni is perhaps a lesson for the future. How small changes, doing small things differently can impact the result drastically. The 'inadvertant ripple in the pond theory.'I found it to be a smart movie, smarter than most created on the West Coast, provocative, out of the box, with an eye towards embracing 'the what if we make just one change' question. It's no wonder it has become an international cult film with an enormous truly diverse following. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury",

    "review/text": "I saw this German movie almost two years ago. However, I can remember this movie clearly, because it really impressed me. It is very philosophical and also exciting movie. Moreover, it is only 80 minutes movie, but I assure you will be fluttered through the entire movie.To sum up this movie simply, heroine Lola have to arrange a hundred thousand dollars in order to save her boy-friend Monni and she manage to arrange it. Monni had to deliver a bag with 100 thousand dollars to the boss of the gangster, but he left it to a train and a homeless man took it away. If they fail to deliver the money, he is likely to be killed by the gangster... From the beginning, as title goes, she is running and running.The movie is made of three short scenarios. They are slightly different with each other at the beginning, but the difference become larger and larger as the scenario proceeds. So the scenarios end up very differently at the end. The style of the movie is fresh and its basic concept is nice. Smaller changes become bigger changes. It is not so special when we see it as words, but I think you will be surprised by this concept in the movie. To people who dissatisfy with the movie of just acrobatic action and seek for philosophical implication, I recommend this movie!",

    "review/text": "The beginning of Run Lola Run has a narrator stating how countless questions result in answers which in turn gives rise to other questions, and so on, in a chain of answers followed by questions. &quot;But in the end, isn't it always the same question, and always the same answer?&quot; The main question might be, will anything I do differently have any consequences? Or why did this happen?Lola's boyfriend Manni has just botched a drug deal, losing 100,000 marks. He has to turn over the money to his connection, a nasty and forbidding bald guy, who will kill him in twenty minutes if he doesn't deliver the goods. Lola, calm, usually on time, and loyal as ever, does what she can to help out her man, who increasingly desperate as time runs out, considers holding up the local supermarket to get the money. She's running a race against time, encountering all sorts of people, including a bicycle courier, a Mr. Meyer who's a colleague of her father, and her father, a humorless, ice-in-his-veins banker who's carrying on with one of his female colleagues, who is pregnant.This portrays three different scenarios of Lola running to save Manni, and demonstrates how one small action or variation can have enormous consequences on other people. An example is the blonde woman walking with the baby carriage. Each time she responds differently to Lola dashing by her. We then see in a series of quick still photo montages what would later happen to her. In one version, she ends up injured from an attack; in another, she ends up winning the lottery. Another is how long the conversation between Lola's father and his lover has progressed before Lola bursts in on them, asking her father for money. Each time, the outcome is different, affecting her father's attitude to her and what Lola does.Another interesting aspect is Lola's piercing glass-shattering scream, which becomes the emanation of her desperation, whether it to be telling her boyfriend to shut up so he can calm down, or her anger at her father refusing to help her.Franka Potente's Lola really lifts the film up, her bright vermilion hair, cyan tank top, and blue jeans nearly mirroring the primary colours of light. She gives credibility in a character who is so much more with it than her boyfriend, whose over-reliance on her makes him incompetent, pathetic, and lacking direction.Director Tom Tykwer must have been influenced by music videos as the swift jump cuts in scenes, nothing that requires a bottle of Dramamine by the TV set, mind you, as the pulsing techno score, matching Lola's frantic running, attest to. An interesting piece of cinema from Germany, great in style and structure.",

    "review/text": "From the opening credits where a swinging pendulum sets the pace, we hear a clock ticking, the beat of the music starts, and this movie never stops with its frenetic and frantic pace. It's a visual cacophony of different and exciting images that run at you around every corner to build in your brain faster and faster until the end of the movie. Phew. Then your heart is still racing from the experience and you want to see it again.Run Lola Run is three films in one, yet, it's the same film time and time again, but it's vastly different that only the characters are the same. The story hit's you repeatedly and builds without repetition. Like each time Lola runs past a person in the street, you learn something new, sometimes funny and perhaps quirky about that person, and all within a few seconds, so by the end of the film it has been a complete encounter.She is running to stop her boy friend from committing a crime. I'm sure I lost pounds just watching this girl run. She's beautiful and compelling. She's also hip and fit with red hair flying in the wind, a tight blue top revels a white bra underneath and her tight green pants flair at the bottom over black boots, definitely not running shoes.This is a film like no other. It's so original that I would recommend it to literally anybody who is willing to suspend his or her belief in a liner world.Run Lola Run is in German with subtitles but you hardly need to read much dialogue before the images tell the story for you.",

    "review/text": "There are very few films that become instant cult classics such as Godard's 1960 Breathless and the less-than-brilliant Pulp Fiction by Tarantino. Run Lola Run in many aspects tops both these movies in its ability to take an incredibly simple plot and turn it into an exgtravaganza of motion, sound and film-making showmanship that redefines filmography and becomes a genre of its own.Run Lola Run is a brilliant combination of a very talented cast, extremely creative writing and masterful video and sound editing, which results in one of the greatest masterpieces in modern moviemaking history. I am not getting carried away!Although the movie is sparse with words, it does an incredible job at providing a unique perspective into the characters lives, sometimes with a single sentence or even just a sequence of camera snapshots:Lola's mother's only sentence in the movie while holding a glass of wine, talking on the phone from home: \"clearly, I knew your ascendant was Sagittarius.... But you are married too\".Lola's relationship with her father:Lola: \"if I can't get the money, Manni will die\".Father: \"Who is Manni?\"Lola: \"My boyfriend for a year now\".We also get a glimpse into random characters' lives through a sequence of camera snapshots, sometimes in a humorous way, all interweaving into the main theme which is the stage and play that we're all part of and how sequences of events change the outcome of the end of the play.Along the plot line there are several humorous winks and tributes to other movies and books which arguably provided some inspiration to parts of the movie. For instance, Lola's ability to shatter glass with her voice is a direct tribute to German author Gunter Grass's The Tin Drum. A silent scene at the casino provides a tribute to Apocalypse Now. The 3 tries plot may have been inspired by Fritz Lang's 1922 Der Mude Tod, etc.Regardless if you recognize these tributes, Run Lola Run is a captivating movie where every frame and every note of sound seem to be perfectly orchestrated by a maestro who is conducting this fast paced, brilliant symphony.Film making at its best!

Instead, they stretched it into a feature film.And it is all offensively idiotic.1 - Lola is at home. Her boyfriend calls her and explains his problem: he forgot some gangster's money on the subway... and some homeless guy found it.This gives birth to one of the most uninspired explanation scenes in movie History. Who's the bad guy, what was the money for, what will happen if he does not get it back, etc... one stupid phone call that lasts forever with Lola and her dumb boyfriend talking... and talking... and talking...Halfway through their ridiculous conversation, I'm already thinking: \"this guy is sooo stupid and incompetent that I DO WANT him to get killed! I hope Lola gives him the boot!\"But she doesn't. Instead, when he says something idiot like \"help me or I'll just rob the supermarket close to this phone booth\" (to which I'd simply reply \"do it, you stupid punk. Then drop dead!\") she just says \"I'll be there in twenty minutes and I'll think of something. Don't do anything stupid!\" - like if that wasn't the rule so far... LOLThen I started thinking: \"Wow, I can't wait to find out what will she do in order to get the money. I hope she'll do something brilliant\".And what does she do? She runs aaaaallllll the way from home to the bank where her dad works. Exactly: the \"running\" you see on the title is to daddy!!!Hello!! Can't we be brilliant and creative?No.Daddy (by far the most fascinating character in this film) gives her the boot (hurray!). And she does not get the money. When she meets her stupid boyfriend, the moron is already robbing the supermarket. She helps him and (guess what?!?!?) she gets killed by the police on the way out.What follows next is (we go back in time) a long and boring bed scene (put there to make some time - so this can be a feature film) where the two lovers are talking... and talking... and talking... for almost 8 minutes things like \"do you love me?\" \"Yes\" \"How much?\" \"A lot\" \"Are you sure?\" \"I guess so\" \"So you are not sure?\" \"I am\" \"what would you do if I'd die?\" \"I don't know\"... -things like that....No wonder why teenagers love this. This is bad teenager screenwriting.And then we see two variations of the same story:B) Lola goes to dad and ends up robbing the bank. She gets the money, but this time it is her boyfriend who gets killed (hit by an ambulance).C)Lola goes to the bank but takes a while longer to get there. Does not find dad and goes to a casino (A CASINO!!!!) that just happens to be there where she gambles some change money and wins all the money she needs... -talk about deus-ex-machina.Is this supposed to be a masterpiece?Would someone please explain to me, like if I were a four-year-old child, why is this film so praised.I do not get it.",

    "review/text": "No spoilers ahead:The story tells of a boyfriend who is in debt. Coming to terms that he will not pay off the debt with only 20 minutes remaining, his girlfriend runs to his aid to try and get the money before time is up. The plot is told three times over to exemplify three different possibilities of what can happen.I'm almost shocked at the abundant amount of raving reviews for this terrible film. I'd like to make a fair review based off of the insight and interesting things about the film, but I honestly fail to see any. For this I can only pick at it:The Music: I'm a big fan of electronic music, so I may hold high standards in this regard, but nonetheless, if you're trying to sport a film with any bit of taste, I fail to see the reason for using terrible beats laden with god-awful cheesy lyrics that just kill the mood. Often the lyrics just made me laugh.The Animation: How arbitrary! I love experimental film, collaging styles and testing waters - but c'mon! Can anyone give me a reason why 10-seconds worth of clips of animation were used in the film? Anyone at all? I'm sorry, but if you want to use animation, use it, but exploit what animation offers, and let it integrate further, even if you use it for just one scene. Even so, watching a cartoon Lola run, then the live-action Lola run just made the live-action one look ridiculous and unexciting in comparison (especially considering how rigid and stern that actress runs).The Characters: Most of the characters have no development and are boring. I don't care if the characters were only used to develop a different story for each of the three sections, but there was nothing to grab on to. Far be it for me to criticize the alternative lifestyles of the characters (ie, Lola's distracting and childish red hair and clothes), but let it not dissuade too much from the terrible acting throughout the film.The Plot: Laying out the same story three times over was just overkill. The plot wasn't interesting the first time, and it certainly did not retain any value a second and third time over. For a plot so plain and uninteresting, I don't see the point in exhausting the ending possibilities, or outcomes. For this, why stop at three? And the third outcome was just too ridiculous for me.The Running: If I see that girl running down the street, I'm gonna run her over myself and save us all the redundancy. The running was never exciting, and it is FAR from action-based as the heart pounding music makes it appear to be. It was way overdrawn and it got to be slavish to watch her going and going.",

It is anything but interesting: the story is childish and shallow and the much talked about cinematography and the music are nothing more than cheap attempts to decorate the silly plot. For those of you who want to buy the movie, rent it first! If you are not a fad-driven kid who actually thinks MTV is a music television and Jewel a poet, then you'll surely dislike it. There are no philosophical ideas here. The mere fact that this movie is considered to be &quot;thought provoking&quot; may be a testament to the reality that perhaps we are not thinking much.",

    "review/text": "For me, this movie got off on the wrong foot when it posed a question and left us hanging for the answer. It basically asked us what the one question in life is, and what that answer is, then suggested that both the question and answer were obvious, and left it there without providing its answers. I could have done without that bit of annoying stupidity.The annoyance factor from that nonsense was strong enough to detract from my enjoyment of the next few minutes of colorful cartoons.To my surprise, the movie got better. After a dismal beginning it became absorbing.The main characters are Lola (young German girl with vivid red hair), her worthless, immature and moronic boyfriend Manni (who you hope will die), and her rich and philandering father. You kind of root for Lola to achieve her goal of saving her boyfriend from execution, but then again, you'd kind of like to kill her boyfriend yourself.Manni was entrusted with a wonderful opportunity in life, the opportunity to complete a drug deal and give the proceeds to the boss. This will help him climb the ladder of success in crime. What an enterprising young man. He does complete the deal, but then he stupidly leaves the fortune on a train because he sees some cops entering the train and he stupidly just gets up from his seat, without the money bag, and leaves. Dumb bunny.He then telephones Lola and whines and panics to her. She swears she will help him. His solution is to rob a supermarket and get the money that way, to avoid being executed for not producing the drug money. He gives her a narrow time frame to show up and help him, because he is on a narrow time schedule himself, due to meet up with the drug boss.That is the background of the film. Lola wants to get the money from her father, but that doesn't work. Her attempts to help the witless and extremely annoying Manni do not succeed, and we have a sad ending for our two heroes.Next thing you know, the happy couple is in bed together, and alive. None of this happened. Was it all a dream? Lola is asking questions about Manni's love for her. They are idiotic questions, but he is patient with them.Presto. The scene starts to play out again. Lola has another chance to help her idiot boyfriend out of the same jam. This time she does it a little differently and the outcome is also different, but still not very satisfying if you are actually rooting for Manni, which I was not.Once again, the happy couple are alive and well, despite the ending to episode two, and they are in bed having another philosophical discussion. This time it is Manni with the questions. Guess what. The scene is redone for us. Take three. Can Lola make things work this time?Other reviews on this site say that we are shown \"cause and effect\" based on different strategies and decisions that Lola makes. No we're not. We're just shown different stories. It's a little like the tv series Quantum Leap, if you remember that one. There was more cause and effect in Quantum Leap than there is here. In Run Lola Run, freak accident or dumb luck determine the outcome as much as any cause and effect.The fact that the third outcome is happier for the dubious couple than the first two outcomes seems to be telling us that Lola finally got it right, but if you use even half your brain you will realize that some very improbable things were happening all along and this is just a fantasy with no moral, no cause and effect, just an interesting story.So, what is that one question that everything boils down to, and what is its answer? The question seems to be, umm, that life gives you the opportunity to interact with your environment, and it's up to you how it all comes out. Maybe not. I don't know what the hell the question and answer are, that are supposed to be so obvious that they don't even have to be told to us.In the end, the script writer needs to get hit over the head with a frying pan for that idiocy at the beginning, and Manni needs to be whipped with a wet noodle to knock some sense into him. I'm sure that torturing him appropriately would help his maturity and character development.This is the only movie I can think of where the idealized happy ending would include the successful completion of an illegal drug deal, followed by a warm pat on the back given by the drug dealer to his brain dead protege.Lola is actually playing Manni's mommy. Manni is a crying, whining, stupid baby getting himself into a jam and then putting it all on mommy to fix, and demanding that she fix it within a specified very limited time frame, and she has to run to do so, to save her idiot baby, and he petulantly blames her if she doesn't perform the miracle, or at least show up, in the allotted time. Being stupid and amoral, Manni is a waste of skin and bone. But mommy helps him and loves him anyway. That's what mommies are for.Oh, and if there is a cause and effect to this movie, the moral would be that you need to ask a higher power for help, and you need to not rob supermarkets. Gamble instead. Get lucky instead, one way or another. The moral is - get lucky! Don't you know that if you just ask the heavens for help you will win the lottery? But if you try to rob a supermarket you will not be happy. Thank you for that wonderful bit of philosophy. Very deep. At least an inch and a quarter deep.",

Lola, with her flaming, bright red hair and tender, spunky, and clever wit, makes this film one of the most unforgettable and exciting foreign films that I've ever seen. For such a simple plot, the film is pure creativity and originality to its fullest. It's a rollercoaster that has many twists and turns as the journey of Lola, who's trying to retrieve money for her boyfriend in distress, Manni, is retold THREE times. Each one is re-enacted in a clever, spontaneous, and yes, even believable way. One thing that Lola, or Manni, could have done changes the whole courses of events completely. Yes, the film is confusing. It makes you wonder if any of those events really happened, or if it's in the imagination of one of the characters. Hell, near the end it feels as if the whole movie was just a dream. That's what makes this film so fun and entertaining. Not only that, but all the suspense and action doesn't take away the affective and well-written dialogue that's absent from 95% of action films. Lola is not just a character with flaming red hair who runs, runs, and runs, and screams so loud that she breaks glass. She has a heart and plenty of spunk that makes her a character worth watching, not just a pretty face to look at. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to watch a fun and entertaining movie that has a bit of a twist, a sense of a humor, and some touchy moments.",

Since, I have added it to my own collection. \"Run Lola Run\" is an exciting, upbeat movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Mannie and Lola are the main characters. They are the German Bonnie and Clyde. Lola is driven by loyalty-Mannie by money. Each plays a vital role in the film. However, the story centers on Lola's ordeal, hence the title, with brief interjections into Mannie's experience.The director carefully sequences three, very possible, scenarios that lead you to yearn for the criminals to succeed. Each scenario contains events that are particular to that version of the story. So, do not blink because some changes are subtle yet intricate to the story line.Music sets the pace. Techno sounds blare in the background, forcing you to keep up with the scenes smearing by. The music controls you-you are but putty in the director's hands-as you hang on every note.\"Run Lola Run\" was better that I ever anticipated. It was very enjoyable and addictive. Each time I watch the film I see something new; I am now going on my fourth viewing.",

It all came together for me in the end, where the real driving point of the film came through: The choices that we make, as small, meaningless and even subconscious as they may seem, can have a profound impact on the outcome of a situation and someone's life.Run Lola Run is divided into three versions of the same scenario, in which Lola must come up with 100,000 deutsche marks in order to save her boyfriend Manni from being killed. Oh, I forgot one thing, she has to get the money in twenty minutes! Each scenario has a different outcome because of slightly different changes in behavior and choices made. There are many subtle effects that these changes have from version to version as well, so pay attention!And in the end, we see that as impossible as it may seem, sometimes we hit that 1 in a million shot.I gave Run Lola Run 4 stars because I thought that the techno soundtrack got old after about a half hour. I think that the style of music definitely contributed to the fast paced nature of the film, but I thought more could have been done in terms of changing the music up here and there to give a more climactic effect at certain points. Thats really my only complaint.I'm glad that foreign filmmakers don't waste their time making movies like spider-man and dude wheres my car, and actually provide the world with intellectually and visually stimulating entertainment.",

    "review/text": "The only thing upon which I can agree with the previous viewer is that the character of Manni is indeed a bit annoying--not too bright, and all too willing to blame Lola for his own predicament. This film is so taught, however, that it hardly matters.Run Lola Run is imaginative, mesmerizing, and take-your-breath-away exciting. The amazing visuals work perfectly with an outstanding soundtrack and a highly engaging storyline to create a truly exquisite film experience. Highly, highly recommended!",

    "review/text": "I've watched \"Run Lola Run\" three times now --once at an arthouse theatre when it first opened, again after purchasing the DVD about a year ago, and again this past week.The first time I watched the DVD, I hadn't realized that there were two different versions --dubbed and subtitled-- on the disk. My wife and I watched the dubbed version and we were both VERY disappointed. Even if you don't understand a lick of German (and we don't), the subtitled one allows you to better gauge the emotions of the original performance. Actors dubbing in the dialogue after-the-fact, rarely, if ever, can match the impact of the original.Last week, I watched it again with a friend --but only after having turned the disk over to the subtitled side.Lola has received a frantic phone call from her boyfriend, Manni. He had left a sack containing 100,000 German Marks on a train... money that he was going to be turning over to his mobster boss in 20 minutes. If he doesn't have the money when he meets his boss, he's dead.Lola dashes out of her apartment with no general idea of how she's going to come up with 100,000 Marks, and interacts with a number of people along the way.As for the lesson in (anti) theology... (from my perspective, anyway)The anti-theological point of RLR is that the most minute change in any event has a cascading effect where the resulting outcome may bear no resemblance to the events that would occur had the minor changes not taken place. In other words, this film is going to disturb the \"events are pre-ordained by God\" crowd.Early in each of her three runs, Lola encounters a nasty old woman, but with the *slightest* variation between the encounters. The first time, they clip shoulders as she runs past... the woman sneers and calls Lola a name, and then the film offers about a dozen \"snapshots\" of the events that follow in the woman's life. (Something involving the government taking her children... or perhaps she had kidnapped them in the first place. I can't say for certain.)The second encounter with the woman results in a much bigger bump... almost knocking the woman over. The woman turns and calls Lola a VERY bad name, but this time the forward-flash snapshots show the woman winning the lottery.In their final encounter, Lola has left the apartment without tripping, and therefore breezes past the old woman because she gets to the same spot about a second earlier. The woman STILL sneers at her, (but does not call her a name!), and this time we witness the next events in her life: Pretty much a mundane snapshot, sitting watching TV with her husband.There were a handful of encounters with different people, and evey minor change created enough changes in the fabric of events that the final outcome was very different.Theists are sure to point out though, that there WAS one scene that would seem to argue on the side of events being pre-ordained: In each of the three segments, a man has a car accident, even though each accident takes place in a different way and at a diffent time. The man of course was DESTINED to have a wreck!Personally, I think they included these scenes to make you think about it... but my personal opinion is that if there were a FOURTH run, (or a fifth or a sixth!), he eventually WOULDN'T have the wreck.Besides, the dramatic differences in outcome for Lola and Manni ought to outweigh any suggestion of pre-destiny for what is a minor scene in the film.",

    "review/text": "Tykwer's &quot;Lola Rennt&quot; artfully demonstrates the temporal placement of an ontological progression. Lola moves through time (twenty minutes) and in doing so calls attention to the arbitrary nature of the lives she passes. We are distanced from the characterizations (which are shallow and undeveloped at best) instead focusing on the nature of her running, and the points in which she comes to friction with the society she is running through.Lola is unkempt. She is garishly attired, with the stop sign red hair that marks the film, defying Hollywood as she trundles along the streets in each of the three segments. She is an atypical female character, tentatively called heroine because there is no way to articulate how she acts for the benefit of herself and her man, and callously moves the world through which she runs. Lola is at odds with the world that regards her through the eyes of complacent security guards and non-believing SWAT-ish teams.The film critiques the stereotypes of relationships and women through its interludes. The relationship between Lola and Manni thematizes the their gender roles, and it is of note in which run the movie is ended, and how it seemingly reaffirms the status quo.In summary, the film is immensely entertaining and services an articulation of a deeper understanding of time and space and the ways in which humans react within said partitioning of being.",

However, this is the best, and I mean the best interpretation of the concept I have ever seen.The direction is excellent. Everything is paced the way you want the film paced without even knowing in a conscious way that's the way it should be. In essence, the film is intuitively guided.Editing is incredible in this film. The best I have seen for a long time, and reminicient without being repetitive of films by Guy Ritchie and Quentin Terantino.Acting is marvelous here. Franka Potente not only captures amazing emotion, she is able to catch the viewer's imagination.The music is really wonderful, complimenting the movie without being intrusive.If you have read this far, I want to tell you two more things. 1)This is really the best film I have seen in quite a while. 2)I can't remember the last time I had this kind of fun watching a film.",

This film is full of energy and never stops for a minute.The basis of the plot is fairly simple. The heroine's boyfriend has lost a large amount of money belonging to gangsters. Lola has a very short time to get the money or her boyfriend will be killed in an unpleasant way. She has to run from her flat and work out some scheme to raise the cash.The film intertwines a series of different plots and endings which could have arisen from that one scenario. Each is in its own way amusing although some are grim.As Lola desperately searches for ways to raise the cash there is a grinding techno beat soundtrack which pulsates with energy. Lola herself is played by an actress with total charisma and screen prescence. The only slight negative to the film is that one wonders how she could end up with such a jerk. The film also uses animated sequences and still photography and is quite inovative in style.Not only do Lola and her boyfriend face different fates in each scenario but so do the bit players that they meet. One of the more interesting and dynamic films in years.",

Combine the look of Madonna's &quot;Ray of Light&quot; music video, and the inter-twined subplots of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and you get a basic feel of what to expect from Lola. The soundtrack fits the film like a glove, doing for Lola what say, a John Williams soundtrack does for a Spielberg film.

    "review/text": "About once or twice a year a movie comes along that renews movie lover's faith in the genre and keeps them going to the theatre hoping to relive the experience. Run Lola Run is one such movie. Just when you think you've seen everything, German director Tom Tykwer takes you on a frenetic &quot;Run&quot; quite unlike anything seen before. The only thing that comes close to it visually are the post Wall Street Oliver Stone movies and none of them are as entertaining as this. The music is great in the way it matches both the fast paced moments and the slower ones in which the characters are sharing their thoughts. Part of the originality lies in the unlikeliest of heroines Lola. Her red hair could very well be fire the way she runs in three separate episodes which all focus on her getting to her boyfriend Manni in twenty minutes to help save him from an unforgiving drug dealer whom he owes money to but which he's lost. One would think early on that there would not be much time in this kind of framework to really come to care about Lola and her dilemma. The director Tykwer however, seems gifted in his ability to show only that which is essential and present it in a way that makes you not only care about Lola but makes you root her on as well. Finally, there is an element of magic in the story that rather than make the film seem unlikely has the effect of making one more resolute that the future is indeed in our hands. It's this magic engineered by Tykwer that makes this film not only one of the best foreign pictures of the year but one of the best pictures of the year period.",

You get the plot from reading all the other reviews. Being a European I usually am on top of exciting new european avantgarde movies. It took me 2 years to discover this gem, and I am glad I did. If you are young at heart and like to be visually stimulated and have a cosmopolitan mind you will like this one. This is not the movie for your average american joe ( sorry I do not want to insult anybody, but there are people in the States that don't even know where the hell Germany is and think there are still tanks rolling around Berlin ). Europe has come a long way in filmmaking and they do not compare to the Hollywood dreamfactory, however this is a rare exception. Enjoy, kick back and watch LOLA RUN!!",

    "review/text": "The movie is about the story of Lola(Franka Potente) who promised her boyfriend Manni (Maritz Bleibtreu) that she would find him 10000 DMs in 20 minutes, and if she failed to appear he would go rob the supermarket. Its not the greatest storyline in the world and the characters in the movie have the amazing capacity to do the most stupid, impulsive things without thinking first, but I must say that I enjoyed the whole movie from start to end and watched it twice, first by myself then with my husband. The comic quality of this movie is dry but good, and its pace is fast which means that you hardly have time to think or predict what the character is going to do next before they do it. The soundtrack is the style of authentic German trance-techno music... which pleased my husband a great deal because he's a German trance-techno fan. This is definitely no quiet, emotional drama... the characters are brash and act and say whatever they want. If you watch the DVD version you can choose to watch the movie in its original German version with English subtitles, or you can choose to watch it in an English-dubbed version. My personal preference is the original German version with English subtitles. The other English-dubbed version I find really irritating because they don't even dub it word for word... original swear-words in German are substituted by tame and ridiculously stupid English words which many of us don't even use in our daily life for swearing or expressing anger. Not only that, the dubbing is unemotional (sounds like the English-dubbers they use to dub Japanese cartoons into English) and it sounds plastic and lacks the real depth of feeling that the original German version contains.",

    "review/text": "I fell completely in love with this brilliant artistic film from the first moment that I laid eyes on it. I got to say I'm pretty surprised I have not heard of it until now, in my English class. There is more action and emotion in the first 30 minutes of this movie than in BraveHeart, Matrix, and any Schwartzenegger film put together. It is a film rich with color, sound, creativity, and non-stop exhilaration!The plot is this girl named Lola has 20 minutes to get to her boyfriend and get him $100,000 before he is killed for screwing up a job. There is no time wasted on subplot, the subplot develops as the story moves on. The cool thing about this movie is that we not only see what happens as Lola scrambles to get the money, but we see it happen three times. Each time Lola's 20 minutes are up, we start fresh with a few things learned and try all over again. What is admirable about Lola is her strong determination to succeed and conquer the obstacles. She fights for what she believes, for what she trusts, and for what she loves.To me, the movie Run Lola Run is also a story of the little intricacies that you, me, and every other person in the world take for granted as we pass each other on the street and pass each other by and how those little meaningless nuances can change our entire lives. The difference between a person running into you and running by you is the difference between you being a baby-stealer and being a lottery winner. The plot may have been simple but the acting was solid, charismatic and charming. The film is so captivating in every aspect; it almost made me forget that this is a German film with English subtitles.",

    "review/text": "Have you ever had a dream where, perhaps you did not like the way the dream was evolving, so you manipulated the events in some sort of re-do/start-over variation, and tried again? Well, this is 'Run Lola Run'...a heart-thumping, high adrenaline romp of a wild ride.Lola is a young woman who is supposed to pick up her boyfriend, Manni, from the train station. Manni - - who is kind of incompetent and obviously dependant on Lola for guidance - - works for criminal-types, and he was to make a delivery of 100,000 deutsche marks to his boss. Due to circumstances beyond Lola's control, she is unable to pick up Manni at the designated time, and he, in his confusion, misplaces the bag which contains the money. Manni is convinced that his boss will kill him if he doesn't have the money; Lola insists she can come up with the money, and Manni agrees to wait just twenty minutes for her, or else he will rob a large retail store nearby to get it. The key here is the twenty minutes. This frantic phone conversation sets everything in motion, and Lola's mad dash commences. As the first twenty minutes winds down unsuccessfully, in that almost dream-like method, Lola is able to re-do the twenty minutes with similar but variant results, and then again a third time. It is the variant results that make the scenes so fascinating. Not only is this girl running with everything she's got, the director strafes you with fast-paced shots, and the pulsing techno-music feels like an aerobic workout in your brain. Each person she comes across causes us to catch a small but interesting glimpse into the effects we all unknowingly have upon each other. And, remarkably, for as little time you get with the lesser characters (her mother, father, people in the street), you are able to develop a much broader characterization and even a better understanding of who Lola is - - independent and confident.The only flaw in this story involves logic. I couldn't help wondering why Lola just didn't go back and change the one thing that would've solved the whole situation - - get to the train station to pick up Manni on time! But, all in all, I think 'Run Lola Run' is a very enjoyable film, and is visually pleasing as well as refreshingly original, story-wise. I am just hoping it does not garner so much attention as to warrant an American copy, starring J-Lo!",

Well, I soon discovered it!This film follows a young woman and her boyfriend as they try to come up with a large sum of money in 20 minutes that is owed to a gangster. What is really cool about this film is that it goes through numerous paths that each person could have taken. Once one storyline is finished, the story starts all over again in a different way. It's very exciting and that excitement is complimented by a pounding techno beat.I would highly suggest this film to everyone and not just those who study film or are into indie films.

    "review/text": "As soon as I heard about this movie I had to go out and rent it...this turned out to be a great decision. I watched it 3 times in one weekend and it is now one of the crowning jewels in my DVD collection.Lola is an amazing chacter, who is very easy to empathize with. with one phone call at the beginning of the movie she is thrown into a dizzying situation which requires her to act entirely based on wit and instinct; she has 20 minutes to get 100,000 marks or her boyfriend, Manie, is a dead man.the short time frame evicts raw emotion from Lola, and she goes thru every obsticle presented to her quickly with no time or patience for anything that gets in her way. the things we get to see are Lola's split second reactions, along with how small differences in her encounters (down to what words a woman uses to curse at Lola) affect not only her outcome, but the future of the other people in the encounter. the use of flash forward still frames gives you a glimpse into these character's changed lives, and does so effectively while not slowing down the movie. There are some scenes, not in the 20 minute timeline, that give an in depth look at the characters. My favorite of these is a scene with Lola and Manie where they have a \"how do you know you love me\" conversation that establishes the depth of their relationship without being over the top or weakening the characters. the movie is WONDERFUL.Personal recomendation: watch the german version with subtitles, it's the best way to get a real feel for the characters and their reactions...the english dubbed version is nowhere near as effective and is even comical on occasions where what you're hearing and seeing just don't mesh.",

That of \"small seemingly insignifigant events can alter our destinies\" (or the flapping of a butterflies wings can cause a hurricane).Rather than focus on that I found myself enthralled by Lola's physical plight through the streets of Berlin. It seemed as a microcosm for life itself. It was a road movie with an overexerted heartbeat. If you don't think this movie was deep I think you may have to take a closer look.The part that set my head spinning was during the third story when Lola has absolutely zero solutions for her situation and asks herself \"what should I do now?...Keep Running.\" Don't we tell ourselves that in some form everyday of our lives. Motion making us cancel out the fact that we may be on infinite auto pilot. Motion cancelling out the fact that at the end of the day we are all going to die anyway.Some people have said that the running became dull or redundant but honestly those are the parts of the film that challanged me to go inside of myself most of all. On top of that this film is truly cinematic (unlike most made these days) and has a driving techno soundtrack.Sometimes actions speak louder than words..and in this case that is proved to the 110th degree.",

Even though Manni and Lola have very litte screen time together, their chemistry is evident throughout. Somehow, Potente and Bleibtreu make is incredibly easy to see why Lola would risk so much for her boyfriend.But, having watched the movie I was left thinking: Wait a minute...if the homeless man used 700 marks to buy the bicycle --> then there is money missing from the bag Manni delivered to his mob boss --> who will surely kill him for this discrepancy. Is this supposed to be noticed, or am I obscenely obsessive and over analytical? Hmmmm",

Many elements are found in the movie, for example: animations, split screens and flashing pictures. The look of Lola is very peculiar: a young girl with intense red hair, she is difficult to forget. The same story repeats three times, however, each time, different things happen; all of them caused directly or indirectly by Lola herself, and each version of the story has a completely opposite ending.

The premise sounds kind of dumb, but the execution is phenomenal. In the great tradition of Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, Lola is given multiple chances to get things right. Lola's first attempts, which end in tragedy, place her right back where she started. All along the way, the audience gets to see how the smallest and seemingly insignificant actions can have the largest consequences. This film speaks volumes about the potential that each human being has to change their life and the lives of others. When I first saw this movie, I couldn't help but become completely engrossed in the film. In some movies, the simplest plots produce the most complex and interesting story lines. This is definitely one of those. Through the simple and seemingly silly premise, the characters bring up very interesting questions about love, family, society, and human needs. Like the other movies I have listed, I recommend this one full heartedly to anyone who is looking for a unique film. I recommend you watch this movie in German dubbing and English subtitles for the full effect however, rather than simply English dubbing.",

I can tell whether a movie is truly excellent if it can make me cheer for the characters--I was jumping up and down in excitement for these characters! Lola has one hefty set of lungs which she regularly uses to her advantage, and I would have screamed along with her. One important aspect of this movie was definitely the soundtrack. The driving rhythms of the techno beat really added a certain nuance to the movie. There definitely would have been a lot missing from the movie had the techno music not been a major part. Another very important part of the movie was the inclusion of excerpts from Charles Ives' &quot;The Unanswered Question,&quot; a monumental piece of classical music. It added a very nice existential touch to the movie, referring to the unanswered question of life. In a way, &quot;The Unanswered Question&quot; was the heart of the film, acting as an interlude between life and death for Lola and Manni and making them re-evaluate themselves and each other, finding out what is most important to both of them. The other characters in the film serve as ordinary people that either play major or minor parts to the cacophony that surrounds Lola and Manni. Lola's father plays the indifferent, two-timing parent perfectly, and everyone else is cast very strong as well. Franka Potente is superb, enough said, and Moritz Bleibtreu is effective as well, portraying a confused and desperate man caught in a bad situation. Wonderful acting, wonderful dialogue, wonderful action, and wonderful music combine for a wonderful movie!",

She does so in three separate sequences a la Rashomon or Jackie Brown (two imaginary, one apparently real) with varying degrees of success.Tight, exhilarating film which starts with way too many MTV-like gimmicks (animation, under-cranking, over-cranking, video, film, black and white, color) but eventually settles into its own beautiful pace and never lets up. Potente delivers an excellent performance as the frantic redhead, running running running (for what seems to be a quarter of the film), her bright mane of flames crackling behind her as she sets the streets afire in her single-minded quest.With all this rushing, it's a small miracle that director/writer Tom Tykwer is able to build these characters as well as he does. Even more amazing, though, is that in under 80 minutes they become one of the most believable on-screen romantic couples of the year, enough to make this one of the year's best films.",

It ambushes you with an unusual plot twist a third into it. It won the 1999 Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and plenty of other awards, so it can shout that from the rooftops.What ever happened to Franka Potente? She'd amassed so much cachet after her electrifying performance here, I'm surprised I haven't seen her more on-screen since. RUN LOLA RUN doesn't ef around. It right away establishes the two leads and the story's central conflict. Potente plays \"Lola,\" a redheaded whirling dervish of a girl who dashes off to rescue her frantic boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) who only has 20 minutes left to recover the 100,000 German marks that he'd lost, and then hand that over to his boss... his very testy mob boss. You wonder what an ordinary girl like Lola can do. I mean, besides run really fast and with arm-pumping abandon. One third thru the film, when things seem at its bleakest, maybe she'll surprise you. Because the thing that happens, I think she wills it into happening.***Hey now, SPOILERS alert for this paragraph!!*** Some say that this film is comprised of three parallel realities that showcase the same characters. Me, I prefer to regard RUN LOLA RUN as a time travel story, because it's cooler that way and it presents a stronger connective tissue. Sort of more12:01than, say,Sliding Doors. RUN LOLA RUN tweaks your senses with some metaphysical themes: free will versus determinism, pure chance versus conscious manipulation of events (see Lola's actions in the casino)... In each of Lola's run, she encounters various passers-by and demonstrates that even the most incidental contact can have far-reaching consequences. I really dig the flash-forward sequences as we learn, in quick-hitting snapshots, what befalls those passers-by, dependent on how their run-in with Lola went. Lola gets three do-overs, and each one presents a different outcome for one and all. That butterfly must be getting tired, flapping its wings so much.Artsy yet unpretentious, visually arresting and generating a frenetic energy, RUN LOLA RUN exhilarates. It makes me not resent reading foreign sub-titles. It makes me want to see more of Franka Potente, if only she would do more movies I had heard of. I mean, there's this one and then the Jason Bourne movies. I may have to tune in to her new show on BBC America, COPPER.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary (in English) by Franka Petente and director Tom Tykwer- Music Video featuring Franka Petente's vocals- Talent Files - brief bios and selected filmographies for Tom Tykwer, Franka Petente, and Moritz Bleibtreu- Theatrical Trailer for RUN LOLA RUN",

The basic plot of the movie doesn't revolve around the dialogue, but having seen it later with English subtitles was a much richer experience. I was so blown away by \"Lola Rennt\" in Germany, I went on a mission to buy the soundtrack before I left the country! (As an aside, it's AWESOME workout music!) I'm re-purchasing today in DVD format to replace the VHS I bought when I returned to the states in 2000. Watch this movie - you won't be disappointed.",

    "review/text": "I watched \"Run, Lola, Run\" without any real insight on what to expect. I had gotten the idea that it would probably be of more interest to young adults but I can attest that us older folks can enjoy it too. I admit that I was initially wondering if I was going to be watching a movie or a cartoon but I got to like the animated version of Lola running down the stairs. The lifestyles on display leave a lot to be desired but I let myself glide past that once I realized what a multi-facetted movie this is.\"Run, Lola, Run\" is a movie that shows us a lot of stories within the stories and a lot of alternate scenarios. If you're one of those \"if only\" second-guessers, this is your chance to find out \"what if\". I liked the variables and I thought that the movie was quite unique in that regard. I won't give anything away although that, itself, may be misleading. This film challenges our expectations and, in doing so, might be giving us a glimpse of the future. I recalled a pavillion at the World's Fair Expo '67 in Montreal. It was, I believe, the Czech pavillion and they showed a movie that stopped at different points in the film when there was a major development. There was a \"time-out\" and the audience was asked to vote for one of several directional options that they were given and the movie proceeded with the requested option. \"Run, Lola, Run\" looks like a movie in which the production staff got several chances to vote on their options and decided to include them all. It works!",

Filmed in Germany(West Berlin) maybe, and lots of outdoor city locations. I have only viewed the sub-titled version, and it works great. A couple dialogue- heavy scenes which require some reading, but not too taxing. I do have a thing for most things German, so I like hearing the language. Also a fine soundtrack in this film! Techno and pulsing, watch this on a home theatre or with a high quality audio system. It really adds to the experience imho. Plus I enjoyed the little \"snapshot\" stills that Twyker throws in along the way. Very cool.Some negative reviewers say they didn't get the film and it was repetitive. Just go along for the ride and enjoy the sights and sound. In my opinion this is a real good way to spend an hour and a half. Try it out! Thanks for reading my sort of disjointed review.",

    "review/text": "When the film first started, I have to say I was ready to write the film off. I notice a lot of films who use wild filmmaking techniques to cover up the lack of substance in the film. With this it seemed as if anything and everything was used to tell the story for wild, fast-paced editing to animated sequences to split-screen. But whereas Requiem for a Dream also had a myriad of visual tricks to make up for the lack of substance, this film is a rollercoaster and knows it and uses it because it needs it. This was not meant to be some tearjerking drama; it's just good energetic stuff.Manni is in trouble because he lost 100,000 of a mobster's money and he isn't happy and he gives him 20 minutes to find it or else. His girlfriend Lola isn't going to just sit around and has to run all over the place in order to help find it before Manni robs a supermarket. But this 20 minutes is told a couple of times over as possible alternatives. Instead of not knowing what will happen but rather where the same story will branch off into different outcomes.Now I should mention the opening sequence which is as kinetic and obvious MTV influenced than anything. By this time I was thinking \"I don't think I'm going to be into this very much\". That is until the film jettisoned that idea and it becomes more energetic and it works better. One of my favorite ideas is at times Lola will bump into someone in a scenario and a series of photographs will show you where that person's life will lead with different outcomes. Example: one guy on a bike will crash and meet a woman and get married while in a different scenario he becomes homeless. It's basically kind of like a butterfly effect and it helps the idea of unpredictability and if different actions would bring different outcomes.Acting is spot-on and no better heroine than Franka Potente. Physically fit with big red hair, it's a good main character as anyone but I have one annoyance. At certain times (3, I think) Lola basically screams her head off and shatters glass and it just seemed unnecessary. Yeah we want to win at Roulette but screaming over recommended decibel levels. But other than that, she's as solid with everyone else pulling in respectable performances.Don't mind the 8-year-old-on-a-placebo-kick opening and you'll find a good example to kill an hour and 20 minutes.",

    "review/text": "Loud enough to shatter glass.There are three keys to the success of this remarkable German language film (with English subtitles): originality of conception, crisp direction and editing, and two attractive stars to play the leads.The stars are Franka Potente, who plays ruby red-haired Lola, daughter of a banker. She is smitten with Manni, handsome young man played by Moritz Bleibtreu, who forgot to keep his grip on a bag containing 100,000 Deutsche marks belonging to his mobster boss. He is to hand over the money in twenty minutes, but he lost it on the train. (It was picked up by a homeless man.) Manni calls Franka and tells her the desperate straits he is in. He says his only out is to rob a store. She says no wait, she can come up with something. What that something is is dear old dad. She looks at the clock. It's twenty minutes until twelve. So Lola starts running to get to the bank and then to Manni before the stroke of noon.If you've seen Truffaut's Les Quatre cents coup (1959) then you know where director Tom Tykwer may have gotten the idea of showing us a Lola who runs like the wind. Truffaut used a sustained shot of his young hero running to convey an uplifting sense of freedom amid action. It worked for Truffaut and it works for Tykwer. Franka, running in nicely fitted pants and tank top (with her white lace bra strap discretely showing) really is a delight to watch. And like Truffaut, Tykwer does not let us see the runner sweat. There is a kind of effortless release, without any straining of our lungs. It is like running in our dreams.What Tykwer does with time is even more interesting. He has Lola run from her home to the bank to Manni three times, each time with a slight difference in the early events, leading to differences in the events to come. In the British movie Sliding Doors (1998) starring Gwyneth Paltrow, something of the same sort was tried with Gwyneth playing out two different permutations of her life based on decisions leading to differing scenarios. I'm also reminded of the brilliant American film, Memento (2000) directed by Christopher Nolan in the way some of the events are played over again. Here the scene as Lola runs by her mother on the telephone is the same three times, but then the differences begin. It might also be said that this movie is the \"many worlds\" interpretation of quantum mechanics brought to cinema. Or perhaps Tykwer was influenced by complexity theory in which a slight change in initial conditions can lead to large changes later on.The story (or rather stories: there are three of them) strain credulity at times. The awful things her \"father\" says to her in the first accounting seems too harsh and stupid to be real. The co-incidence of Manni's spotting the bum on the bicycle in the third tale seems a bit too lucky to be believed. And the allotment of twenty minutes of time in the three sequences was a bit off. However some of the other events seemed to me to be plausible or at least very clever and therefore allowable in an artistic sense. That the man in the ambulance regains a steady heart beat because she holds his hand is something this old guy can believe. And the cops mistaking her for a bystander in the bank robbery seems like credible cop behavior to me. And for those who think that the casino event was too much to believe, consider this: Assuming that the roulette wheels in Germany have both a zero and a double zero, the odds against betting on the number twenty and hitting it on consecutive spins of the wheel are 1/36 times 1/36 which equals about 77/100,000 or about 1300 to 1. It's a long shot, but nothing like winning the lottery. Incidentally she had in the bag 115,600 Deutsche marks (her initial 100 marks x 34 x 34).For those of you who haven't seen this remarkable film, consider this: it lasts 80 minutes, but it will seem like fifteen. The \"throbbing techno score\" is haunting and there are some nice action sequences. This is the kind of (R-rated, however) movie you can see with your teenaged son, although he would probably prefer to see it with his buds.",

    "review/text": "A T.S. Eliot quote. A swinging pendulum and spinning hands on a monstrous clock. Countless faded figures moving quickly by.And in the center of the crush, a man in a cop uniform says (in German), \"The ball is round. The game lasts 90 minutes. That's a fact. Everything else is pure theory.\" He kicks it into the sky.Well, Tom Tykwer certainly knows how to get our attention. And it's only a few minutes in the kinetic, high-octane, colourful world of \"Run Lola Run\" -- a wild action/romance that studies the ripple effect of our lives, and the changes we can make in the name of love.Lola (Franka Potente) receives a call from her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), a drug courier. Because Lola's moped was stolen, Manni had to take the subway home -- and he accidentally left behind a bag of money. Now he has twenty minutes to somehow get 100,000 marks, or his boss Ronnie is going to kill him.Lola races across Berlin to her father's bank -- only to find him with his mistress, and hear that he's leaving his other family. Desperate, she runs to where Manni is waiting, and helps him rob a convenience store. But as they flee, the police catch up to them -- and Lola is shot.\"But I don't want to. I don't want to leave,\" she mutters. And time rewinds to where she left her apartment -- and this time, Lola's determined to do things differently. As she runs from one end of Berlin to another, she sends ripples through the lives of those she passes -- and she'll keep running until she finds a hundred thousand marks to save herself and Manni.\"Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt)\" was what propelled Tom Tykwer to international fame. And given that his other movies tend to be slower and more dreamlike -- though no less striking visually -- this movie is striking not only for its speed, but the sweet romance and the lesson about the old \"butterfly's wings\" adage. (Also see: \"Happenstance\")Admittedly, a woman running through Berlin is not terribly interesting in itself. But the world of Lola is filled with brilliant rave colours -- Lola's blazing red hair, colourful room, the sights of Berlin -- and her race against the clock is punctuated by little vignettes of the future lives of various people she bumps into. That momentary contact is enough to change their lives -- sometimes for better, or worse.And Tykwer's style is a spicy mix -- arty shots (going through a clock mouth or an apartment building?), German techno, cartoon interludes with an animated Lola running for it, Lola changing reality with her screeches, and the snapshots of people's futures, seen only for a second -- but very revealing. Not to mention the equally colourful, MTVesque cartoons of Lola running down stairs, evading dogs, et cetera.But even aside from Tykwer's artistic flair, it's a great movie -- the atmosphere is painful and taut during the scenes in the bank, including Lola's robbery. And periodically, we see some sweet red-tinted interludes of Manni and Lola in bed, discussing their feelings for each other. They're little oases of calm and love, in the middle of all the running.Franka Potente does a solid job as Lola, an ordinary punky girl who loves Manni more than anything, and must find the RIGHT way out of their shared dilemma. She gets some nasty surprises from her uptight, adulterous dad, though. And Bleibtreu does magnificently as Manni, who is overcome with fear, frustration and anguish because he knows that his boss is going to kill him.\"Run Lola Run\" is a kinetic, vibrant, and a romantic little look at how a moment can change your life. Everything else is pure theory.",

    "review/text": "Tykwer created a cinematic monster when he shot Run Lola Run. The director had a limited budget and time, so the choice of shooting with a digital camera made this opus possible. Tykwer had limitless possibilities with this media, and made full use of the surreal capabilities of his camera. The viewer is dragged on a journey through time and space, and s/he is left wanting more. The simple intense dialogue grounds this film in its setting and the thumping techno beats of the soundtrack keeps the viewers heart racing. This film is not only useful for modern German cultural studies, it is ideal for the German language classroom. Run Lola Run is a memoir of a moment in history. The red haired heroine races to unite the once divided city of Berlin, and in doing so tries to find an identity for herself and the German people. Entertaining and heart wrenching, this film stands the test of time. Run Lola Run is a masterwork of post-unification German cinema. Whether it be the digital shots, the pulsing soundtrack, or the repeating storylines, this film takes the viewer on a journey that s/he will never forget.",

    "review/text": "I don't think this movie was really so much about the untypical heroine versus hero. I think it was more about the what-ifs situations.This movie is an interesting take on public perception with a heavy emphasis on the Butterfly effect. Lola has 20 minutes to produce 100,000 Marks or her boyfriend Manni gets killed. As she's running through the streets of Berlin figuring out how to come up with the cash, she bumps into people along the way who see this red-headed stranger in a hurry. No one really knows why she's in such a hurry nor is she aware of what's going on in their lives. Lola bumps into a woman with a baby carriage; what little importance she has for this woman as she struggles to save another life. The feelings are mutal from the woman, yet, three times we get a glimpse into her three possible futures. The uniqueness of the movie is depicted in three alternate endings based on different choices Lola makes in her desparation to get the cash for her boyfriend.Lola doesn't make discoveries about people until she stops for more than a minute to realize what is going on around her, and vice versa. Had she never gone to her father for money, she never would have found out he was having an affair. Had she stopped to talk to the woman with the baby carriage she might have found out she was buying a lottery ticket she would later win or was beaten or which ever scenario panned out. But then she would have missed the chance to meet her father. Etc. Etc. Etc. Questions leading to more questions to more questions.The butterfly effect is seen throughout the movie even in the beginning when Manni blames the loss of the money on Lola not showing up on time to pick him up after the drug deal which caused him to take the train to bump into the homeless man who distracted him from the sack of money he was supposed deliver and leaving it on the train. At first you scoff at the boyfriend's irresponsibility for blaming Lola for his own mess up, but that's where the butterfly effect really begins and, like it or not, Lola started it all.In the final scenario, Lola makes a different choice...she stops running lon enought to spend a few minutes with a dying man in an ambulance as he recovers. In the end, the running was for nought. Her boyfriend ends up solving his own problem. Lola wass useful in one man's life but useless in helping another. Is it all inconsequential? Just a passer by? Probably not.If you're not into alternative films then this might not be for you. Even I was left a little confused. Yet, it's a worthwhile movie taking on a curious angle on how in some form or another our actions affect others just in the nature of our being.",

    "review/text": "Tom Tykwer`s &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is a breath of fresh air. There is so much creativity and vision in this small film that it stands alone against the overblown star vehicles the major studios keep forcing upon us. It is a film brimming with energy and inspiration and a powerful salvo against Hollywood conventionalism.Lola (Franka Potente) is told by her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) that he has lost a bag with 100,000 deutsche marks in it. She realizes that he will most likely be killed if the money is not delivered to the gangster Manni was supposed to meet. This realization starts Lola off on a quest to come up with the funds on her own. With time running out, Lola bolts out of her apartment and runs . . . and runs . . . and runs . . .\"Run Lola Run\" is a treatise on the infinite possibilities a single situation can spawn. It is a metaphysical examination of how the choices we make will affect us forever and how the actions of others can profoundly influence the circumstances of our lives. Yet, on a more simplistic level, it is also an energetic display of filmmaking at its most creative. Its unique use of freeze frames, novel camera angles, instant replays, and animation is proof that Tykwer is determined to give us a viewing experience unlike anything we've ever seen before. With a pulsating soundtrack and a bravura performance by Potente to complement his boundless creativity, Tykwer succeeds in creating a truly original work. Here's hoping that his example will inspire the current generation of filmmakers to test their own creative limits in the hopes of surpassing the standard set by \"Run Lola Run.\"",

Ein Penner hat das Geld jetzt aber Manni hat gar keine Ahnung, wo er ist. Jetzt kommt ein Mann fuers Geld. Wenn Manni es nicht hat, wird er erschossen werden.

Don't worry, it's all just an opportunity for you to catch your breath as the bass'll be thumpin' again before you know it. The immediacy of the threat faced by Lola and Mannie keeps you engrossed by their every move. I found myself far more interested in their characters in 30 minutes than I have been of three hour long epics. The way I see it there is absolutely no reason for anybody not to see this movie. For those scared off by the subtitles, don't be. I guarantee after five minutes you'll have forgotten all about 'em.",

It's powerful soundtrack, the brilliant photography, witty direction and above all, fine pieces of acting, combines together to deliver a masterpiece.Run Lola Run is about the uncertainty in how things 'could have been' had 'this' happened. Upon viewing, one is immediately led to place themselves in the shoes of Lola , don't be surprised if you find yourself screaming - ohh, I wish I had read the newspaper earlier in the morning, I wouldn't have missed out on the deal they had down at the Mall,... or conversely, romantically recollecting - If I hadn't missed the bus the day I met Jerry we would have never been such good friends,... - everything that we do, our actions, even the subtlemost of events changes every following event - that is the main theme. The director does a brilliant work of explaining how every action shapes the future in a cleverly crafted movie with a very apt soundtrack. This is one movie you won't forget too soon, if you want to see a title with productive context, yet not drab as a documentary, or fast-paced and context-less as most Hollywood Action productions, watch this. It never drags even for a moment, provides the viewer with food for thought, while at the same time produce a brilliant work of visualizaion and above all, a novel and absorbing unpredictable storyline.",

    "review/text": "1. The most original directing I have seen in years. Oliver Stone tried to make this kind of movie when he made Natural Born Killers, but failed miserably. Tom Tykwer succeeds triumphantly.2. One of the best soundtracks in film history. The next time you watch this (and believe me, you will want to watch it over and over), just listen to the music, and watch the visuals - don't pay attention to the dialogue. Amazing, isn't it?3. Franka Potente is one of the most mezmerizing women I have ever seen on screen. You could watch this movie over and over and only look at her face the whole time.4. This movie has the unique ability to make things that you might normally perceive as boring so hypnotic that you can't take your eyes off of it. For example, who would have that a running woman could be so interesting? In the hands of Franka Potente and Tom Tykwer, it is absolutely riveting.For all these reasons and more, see this movie. I love this movie so much, and I've probably seen it well over 10 times, but at the same time it's hard to describe WHY I love it. I've tried to do that here, but I really can't. You are just going to have to see it to believe it.",

I found myself unable to keep from moving with it. But, it's more than just a music video. The story behind this movie, similar to Sliding Doors, is one of &quot;What if...&quot; It takes you through three different scenarios showing how everything is affected by everything else. The slightest change can cause an entire day to go differently for everyone. The metaphysical ramifications are astounding. The future's not fixed. Our lives aren't predetermined.

What makes it novel, perhaps, is that it's applied to a non-science fiction setting. But, as interesting as the concept is, it does other films and television shows an injustice to regard _Run Lola Run_ as an entire innovation.What separates _Run Lola Run_ from other films is not the story itself so much as the way the story is told. Director Tom Tykwer is an auteur run amuck. From the opening sequence, we are completely at the mercy of Twyker's powerful vision._Run Lola Run_ is the collision of German expressionism, Czech animation, and MTV. So much of this film is told though this blend of visual styles, in fact, that one could turn off the subtitles and understand most of what was going on.This is not to say that the film is a vacuous visual metaphor. Far from it. Tykwer has crafted a genuine story here, with a great moral center. It's just that that morality is not exposed through pages of dialogue. Tykwer, instead, uses so many techniques, so well-edited together, that the characters are largely defined visually before you even know what's happening.Clearly, this is a must-have film for anyone seriously interested in the craft of filmmaking. Not only will you learn a lot from the cacophony on display in the film itself, but the commentary (only in English) is especially enlightening. This is one of the very few secondary audio commentaries on DVD in which the lead actress plays a part, and her insight is invaluable. It's extremely intriguing to hear scenes relived from both sides of the camera. More interestingly, though, Tykwer's explanation of how he pulled off his vision is something that will energize even the most casual filmmaker.",

Using a formula as seen in Kurosawa's classic \"Rashomon\" the story postulates three possible plot scenarios, aided by some clever cartoon segments.The crux of the story involves Lola played by Franka Potente from \"The Bourne Identity\" and her boyfriend Manni played by Moritz Bleibtreu. Manni, a low level criminal and certainly not the sharpest knife in the draw, is acting as a courier for 100,000 deutsch marks the proceeds from a deal. Due to a foul up in plans he witlessly leaves the funds he is to deliver to a dangerous gangster on a subway where they are scooped up by a bum. He desperately calls up Lola telling her that they must come up with the 100,000 within 20 minutes or he's dead meat.Lola implores him to wait, assuring him that she'll get the money. However Manni has rashly threatened to rob a large nearby supermarket to procure the money.The plot continues as we see Potente running wildly through Berlin attempting to get the dough. Three separate possible scenarios play out as she rushes to her dad, who is a bank manager, to try and get the funds. Fate has a large part in determining how each possibility will turn out.",

    "review/text": "This German film is a fascinating exposition in how events in our lives that my seem trivial can actually have a huge effect in the long run. Much like Ray Bradbury's butterfly, who's death in prehistoric times forever changed how the English language was written, this movie explores the domino effect. By exploring three different outcomes from the same triggered event, it successfully reminds us that every moment of our lives is important. Through the film, some of the differences between the three versions are very obvious, and some are quite subtle. I enjoy such subtlety, as it allows me to watch the film more than once and see new things each time.Beyond the philosophy and creativity of the storyline, this film is also very well shot. Bright colors and eye candy fill the 80 minute showing, complimented with heart-racing fast-paced editing and manic visual effects. By the end of the film, one might be just as exhausted as Lola.I have not seen a lot of German cinema, myself, but after seeing this film, I think its time I explored their exports more.",

    "review/text": "This film from German director Twyker is a real treat. In it we follow Lola try to raise 100,000 marks for her boyfriend Manni to pay back some gangsters, the only catch being that she has to do this in only twenty minutes! And so the audience is treated to three different ways in which Lola gets the money.This film has several things going for it - a pulse-pounding techno soundtrack (with Franka Potente who plays Lola on vocals), stunning visuals and a fast story that you really get caught up in. All of this makes for a very flashy movie that will completely draw you in. However, what gives it that extra twist is the way in which the movie shows that the slightest thing can set the course of our future, demonstrated by snapshots of people that Lola meets in her travels through their lives. Plus there's some extraordinary acting from the two main characters that makes you really care for their plight.What's also different is the fact that the movie manages to be sad, funny and gripping. And film that can achieve that has to be recognised. There are also some highly interesting scenes in between each story in which the young couple discuss love, the future and other such topics. It's little wonder that this was so highly acclaimed, and is likely to become a cult classic in years to come.",

    "review/text": "In today's world of big-budget, formula movies, it is refreshing to come across a movie that tries to be a little different. Run, Lola, Run starts with slow music and a quote from TS Eliot. Almost immediately, the beat kicks in and a techno soundtrack envelopes the viewer. And once the techno starts, so does the action. Lola receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend, Manni, who is working on a shadowy business deal. All he has left to do is pay 100,000 marks to an associate, but he's lost the money. In a panic, he tells Lola that he has twenty minutes to pay or he's dead. Lola then panics and tells Manni to stay put. She doesn't know how, but she'll bring him the money. And thus, Lola begins running.From this point on, the movie becomes three slightly different stories, each telling how Lola gets the money for Manni and each with a different ending. All three stories have many common elements, used to emphasize how a few moments difference can change an outcome. The first two stories are great and well executed; but the third story is a little far-fetched and somewhat slower in pace. Still, the energy of all three is overwhelming.This movie has several great qualities: the directing, the visual appeal, the interesting story, the incredible music (which adds to the feeling of urgency) and Franka Potente (Lola). Franka is very convincing as Lola and pulls off the endless running scenes looking like she could have been in the Olympics. With these qualities, this movie is a knock-out.The one major flaw of this movie (in my opinion) is that it doesn't quite tell you what the point is in telling the three different stories. Perhaps I'm not used to fine film-making and simply cannot figure out the theme of this one. The other thing I did not understand was Lola's screaming. On several occasions, Lola screams and shatters glass. Why or how is not clear to me. Perhaps you can figure it out. And even if you don't, you'll still love this movie.",

This film follows three potential outcomes for this situation, and it does it in a smart, entertaining fashion.The only problem I have comes with a lot of the promotional material and the hype -- before I saw this movie, everything I read about it said it was about how &quot;choices&quot; can affect the way your life unfolds. This isn't exactly what the movie is about.While Lola certainly does make different choices in each of the three scenarios presented, the crux, the starting point, NEVER changes -- Lola makes the same FIRST decision and the metaphorical snowballs are sent in three different directions originally because of accidents of timing and fate rather than any choice she makes.Still, this is a highly entertaining film and well worth picking up -- just don't be fooled.",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run is alot like &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; only extremely better.It features three different scenarios all following the same girl Lola, who must get 100,000 marks for her boyfriend Manni in 20 minutes, or else he will be killed. As Lola runs through the streets of Berlin to an amazing techno soundtrack (which I highly recommend) she passes by people in brief moments,which show a short series of shots describing the rest of their lifes with no words. In the first two scenarios, in which the outcome is tragic, both Lola and Manni seemingly freeze time, then it starts all over again. The film explains how things could happen differently, depending on what a person does, this proven by how the outcome of each scenario is different, and how the people Lola ecounters' lifes are different in each scenario. Some of the best parts are when Lola screams, shattering glass, and silencing everyone around her. The last scenario, which has the best outcome, is obviously the one people would choose to end the movie, however a question remains. Which scenario really did happen and which two are simply theory? The film also gives a good example of the multiple worlds theory, which suggests that everytime a person makes a choice, a new world is created where everything is the same, except the choice the made and its consequences. This proposes that all the scenarios did happen, except in different places with different outcomes, judging Lola's and those around her's choices. The film has a very interesting beginning, with shadowy figures walking around in a crowd, while a mysterious voice asks philisophical questions along with appearences by the people Lola runs by in the movie At first it does not make sense, but after the movie is over, one gains a better understanding of how the beginning fits into the rest of the movie. The greatest German movie I've ever seen, any fan of good films should see it, and if they like it as much as I did, buy it.",

Instead of creating intensity by adding a lot of shooting, car chases and people dying like flies, they make it by original filming, use of colors, use of great fitting music, making frequent unexpected and twisting turns and coming up with things that just haven't been done before.Run Lola Run or &quot;Lola Rennt&quot; is one of the best movies like that. Based on a dream the director had about a girl with bright red hair running, it is about just that. Lola (Franka Potente) is running for the life of her boyfriend and for their life together, to save everything she holds important in life.By playing the story three times, with three different outcomes and with several different short side-track stories, the movie makes you realize how much our lives and faiths are controlled by those little details that happen every day.If you want an alternative to the standard Hollywood action movie where the good guy has to kill several bad guys and the bad guys kill even more insignificant good guys, this definately is a movie for you.",

Both retell the same story several times with variations, but there the comparison ends. Kurosawa uses Rashomon to explore how truth is in the eye of the beholder, while Run Lola Run, with its breathless pace, uses a video game conceit to illustrate a metaphysical debate along the lines of if a butterfly flaps its wings in China, will it rain in New York. In this case, when something goes wrong, the character has the chance to hit the &quot;reset&quot; button &amp; get a another chance to make it right, bumping into people or narrowly missing them in her quest &amp; causing different fates for them every time as well. Something that should be able to satisfy both art-house buffs &amp; action fans. The extras on the DVD are fun. I have watched it subtitled mostly, but also dubbed, and, one night where I felt a little silly, both dubbed &amp; subtitled. Good commentary &amp; music video, too.",

Making a heroin into a hero is the new way. Also, how Lola dresses is challenging to the cinematic male gaze. The typical Hollywood heroin is skinny, having a long hair, wearing high heels and smiling. However, Lora doesn't have any of these elements. Tywker's challenge leaves us a question. Is Lora a hero all the way in the film? Although Lola is trying to be a hero to save Manni, Tykwer makes the last scene close to what traditional endings in Hollywood movies. The close up shot of Lola and Minni holding hands is ironic because it seems like it is a happy ending. This ending asks audiences that &quot;Is Lola really happy?&quot;. Lola wants to save Manni but he solves the problem himself. Even though Lola breaks the gender role, her lover Manni is in control of a situation.However, by making the ironic ending, the third part is stood out from first two parts. The third part is more realistic than other two parts because Lora's situation is similar to what female positions in Hollywood and everyday lives. Therefore, I think Tykwer is asking that how we think about Lora's situation which is familiar to us.",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run, directed by Tom Tykwer, confronts stereotypes produced by Hollywood, with its unique graphic and audial representation as well as plot technique. Lola, our heroine, has 20 minutes to reach boyfriend Mani with a replacment for the money which he has been placed in charge of and lost. Lola is far from our average American female lead. Her hair is bright red, she's loud, and is imbued with superhuman powers. Not only is she able to sprint all-out for thirty minutes, she also is able to make it accross Berlin in this amount of time, and appears briefly as a cartoon character. Despite all this, in all of the scenarios, Lola never succeeds. Tykwer employs the use of three different senarios that play upon the butterfly effect and illustrate situations that Lola may or may not have experienced on her journey to Mani. The film is very contrary to stereotypes perpetuated by American cinema. Lola is everything but a heroine; she does not possess extraordinary beauty, has no control over her situation, and is unable to succeed in any area of her life it seems. She is unemployed (depicted by her low quality clothing) and so is her boyfriend Mani, apparently.Tykwer's use of unusual graphic depiction (cartoons), techno ambience (created by the musical track, which does not allow the viewer to rest), and portrayal of Lola as the anti-heroine all create such an unrealistic combination as to contrast and expose the lack of reality in traditional female heroines and movies.The original tital Lola Rennt (Lola Runs), was translated into Run Lola Run. Lola, who was originally running of her own volition, is now being told to run, presumably by Mani, a source of patriarchy in Lola's life. Lola runs to her father in the scenarios, requesting money from him. She represents the low class female, seeking help from the privileged, wealthy patriarchy. In one scenario, Lola dies, leaving Mani to gaze upon her devastated, unattractive body. Mani comments upon her appearance, leaving Lola once again in the role of the surveyed. In the final scenario, Lola comes to the rescue only to find that Mani has solved his problem, and that her help was unneccesary. Where before Lola has taken charge and responsibility, she is now powerless and useless, again in contrast to the heroine stereotype. The film closes with this thought and is emphasized by the shot of Mani and Lola interlocking hands. Lola is no longer seperate, equal, or powerful, and Mani does not need her.",

Sometimes there is so much going on that seeing it for the second time ties it together for you. Some of the movies that come to mind are Magnolia, the usual suspects, etc. Run Lola Run is also one of those movies. I cant believe any one would give it a bad review or say it was boring. Its a great fast paced movie and the plot is not that far fetched to understand. The repetitive scenes are forgivable and needed at the risk of loosing the reality of the movie and with such a good soundtrack, its not painstaking to sit through a few seconds of repetition. Every person I have turned on to this movie loved it! I suggest you see it twice at least.",

Chaos Theory includes the Butterfly Effect which describes causal equations whose outcome are susceptible to very fine changes of input. (e.g. the air currents stirred by a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil starts a chain of atmospheric changes that effect whether or not it rains in New York.) In quantum mechanics, the Many Worlds Theory explains temporal paradoxes by proposing that for every possible variation of every event, a parallel universe is spawned which continues a particular chain of events.Our butterfly Lola flaps her wings over here and people meet, get married, age, and die over there. She flaps her wings a little differently and cars crash, people fight, Manni lives.The story is propelled by a brilliant pulse-quickening techno-dance soundtrack produced in part by the director. The movie, as a whole, works, hurling the audience towards the mutable, uncertain conclusion.Unfortunately, all is not perfect. The dubbed English dialog, at best, features uninspired performances and, at worst, completely discolors the movie. Fortunately, the art shines through this detracting artifact and the film still rates a &quot;five.&quot;",

    "review/text": "Lola receives a frantic phone call form her boyfriend. He will be killed by his gangster bosses in twenty minutes if he doesn't come up with one hundred thousand deutsche marks, the amount he lost in a botched money transfer. So Lola runs, literally, into the streets of Germany, hoping to find means to the money in twenty minute's time.Lola is sweet, worldly and young and so is her boyfriend. They need be, to gain our sympathy against the common but evil financier status quo of Europe. Their attempt to beat the clock against an impossible task, is the one and only subject matter of the film. The story, or idea, is told in a fast paced, rock video style narrative, part light humor, part sharp suspense, with lightning strike synonymous time frames of the same characters and situations, projecting Lola's stressed mental state of adrenaline rushed physical endurance and high powered decision making.By the time Lola starts out on her third attempt to save the day, (it's the charmer), you might begin to wonder how the film will pull itself out of it's self-imposed infinity, as it flails deep into a hole of pretense tempting filmmaking and already dated Euro-trash musical score. But it does, as happily as an adult, lust rewarding fairy tale. While we view a detailed visual feast of a gothic German metropolis as backdrop, it is the sight of the shapely, but not particularly athletic Lola running that captures our attention. Indeed, there is a lady or a tiger at the end of this road, or in this case, a pot o' eurodollars or certain death. Like a modern day 'Diana and the Golden Apples', our heroine radiates stamina and endurance and beauty as she runs down yet another crooked path. So run, Lola, run. You'll shed those few extra pounds yet.",

A dynamic visual style doesn't make a good movie. Run Lola Run could pass for a 90 minute Nike commercial, targeted towards today's alternayouth (TM). It's aesthetic sensibilities are (incidentally) very much that of a late-90s commercial, as are its themes. The exploration of the delicate nature of circumstance is vaguely thought-provoking, but that's all. I was reminded of that stupid watch commercial where the guy's watch is off by 1 second, and he consequently doesn't bump into the woman of his dreams on his way to work. If only he'd had a Rolex! (Or Timex, or whatever brand it was for.)If you watched this movie and thought it was really deep, then my advice to you is to start watching less movies and to start reading more books. To worry less about what crazy new color your hair is going to be dyed today, or what super-obscure local band you're going to add to your list of &quot;crappy music I pretend to like so I'll look cool and unique,&quot; -- and to sit down with some Nietzche or something.Run Lola Run rubs me the wrong way in this fashion, I admit. Like other loud, superhip, wanna-be-art-movies of the past decade, it strikes me as a soulless, obnoxious byproduct of an increasingly narcissistic and mindless subculture, more concerned with cheap thematic gimmicks and cliche sociological statements than creating a complex and high-quality story. The characters in Run Lola Run are soul-wrenchingly annoying, so much flash and so little flare. Obviously the director, writer, and actors all hope to compensate for Lola and Manni's (?) inherent dullness and shallowness by loading on the style, making sure that everything looks and sounds cool enough to keep an already mentally stunted audience from thinking too hard (except about the one or two unsophisticated, done-so-many-times-before things it wants you to think about.)All in all, a flashy waste of time. The only moment in the film I whole-heartedly enjoyed was when Lola's rake-on-the-nerves dopey boyfriend gets plowed down by a bus. Although generally a stupid scene, the pure joy of seeing that whiney little idiot (along with every gelled and bleached hair on his ugly little head) get run over by a large vehicle is indeed worth an entire star.",

So I thought I'd check out the rest of his films.Lola gets a call from her boyfriend that he's lost his crime boss' money. And the boss is coming to collect it in 20 minutes. So Lola starts running, originally to see her dad who is a banker. And then depending on how fast she can go or whether she gets held up or not, entire lives can work out differently not only for herself but also for people that she bumps into - literally. The movie shows us 3 possible scenarios.The action's obviously quite fast, because she's running just about the whole movie, so you are made to feel that things are happening. But it's all extremely shallow, the thrills and developments are very uninteresting.We are shown fates of people we do not care about at all. This is one of the main flaws of this film. It assumes that the audience will care about strangers. The only guy I cared about in the movie was the homeless fellow, I looove that beard. Even Lola and her boyfriend didn't really move me, though they looked like a lovely couple.The message of the film is also very much irrelevant. That the little choices we make, or even just pure chance, can have big effects on our lives and others'. No kidding! Give this guy a Nobel Prize! But I have a question: So what??? You go about your life doing things the way you see fit. There's no place for what ifs and what would have happened if my dad had chosen my aunt instead of my mum? Irrelevant.The annoying thumping music adds insult to injury, it is very poor, something you would expect at a brain numbing nightclub just to keep you awake.All in all, it's an interesting enough film, if only cos you are curious how it will end but apart from Lola's and the homeless dude's hair there's not much there to really care for or remember. 5 out of 10.",

The one scene I cannot get out of my head is the one where Lola walks her father out of the bank at gunpoint; The scene was very reminiscent of Point of No Return with Bridgette Fonda where Fonda's character is &quot;escorting&quot; Gabriel Byrne at gunpoint out of the training compound.Actress Franka Potente's character Lola has an uncanny resemblance to Fonda's character as well.I, too, enjoy looking at foreign films for their originality and freshness. Yet, sometimes they lack a certain finesse or refined technical quality that most North American or U.S. films possess. I don't know if it's the lack of technology or filming budget. It may be intentional to give it that European artistic and gritty nuance.The performance by Franka Potente was believable ( young and desperate). The actor who plays Manni (Lola's boyfriend) is also credible ( incompetent and uneasy). Yet, I have no idea why there's animation thrown in with cetain scenes. The only quality I like about the movie was it's simple story (or stories) and characters. Otherwise, this is one independent foreign film I can do without--No matter what any professional film critic or European Cannes Film festival connoisseur says !",

    "review/summary": "A film you can dissect and see how all the elements work",
    "review/text": "You must see this film with a loud sound system.Run Lola Run is high impact on every level. The plot is easy enough: Lola's motor scooter is stolen and as a result she is unable to pick up her boyfriend Manni for an important criminal gem/money exchange. Manni, forced to walk, and take the train, left the money on the train and a bum ran off with it. Lola has 20 minutes to raise 100,000 DM and save her boyfriend Manni from being killed by a crime boss.Three scenarios play out in the film. Two end in disaster, one ends in triumph. The music and thumping of the tech music soundtrack serves as the score, the beating of the main character's heart, and the tick-tock of a 20-minute window of time slipping away. The visuals are a marvel, making use of filmed scenes as well as scenes shot on video and later transfered to film for a muted look. Every scene with Lola or Manni is film while any scene without them is shot on video.Pay attention to where the color RED appears (phone, hair, ambulance, and even the color of the bedroom scenes that separate the three scenarios). Try to see where the old blind lady (God)with black sunglasses appears in each scenario and what purpose she serves. Note the occasions when glass breaks. See how the fates of peripheral but essential characters in the film change from scenario to scenario in these sudden moments of flash frames. Lola's father is a sinner, a bank executive who is cheating on his wife, Lola's mother, with a woman with fading reddish-brown hair. Red, failure, mortality. He denies Lola any help and reveals to her the affair without remorse. My favorite use of visuals is comparing a round clock (a symbol for our mortality) with the round roulette wheel in a casino (God's clock...where miracles happen). At one point Lola runs across a huge open courtyard with a fountain and it looks exactly like a roulette wheel and the betting grid. Lola is killed in one scenario, watches Manni get killed in another, but succeeds in the third because she \"surrenders\" to the almighty while praying and running with her eyes closed through busy Berlin. Lola is \"guided to a casino, hence the roulette wheel. Of course, Lola's hair is red, but she does not bet on Red. Red is blood, red is failure, red is our mortality. When she gambles her only money she bets on the number 20 (minutes)and on the color BLACK, the color of the Nuns, the black sunglasses, and hence the intervention of God. She wins on that number twice in a row, a miracle. She walks away with over 100,000 dm.Lola is put into service for the almighty when she gets into an ambulance (red ambulance) and holds hands with a heart-attack victim (a guard from her father's bank.) Her presence gives him the will to live and his heartbeat, a thumping music of a different sort, returns to normal.Manni is also \"saved\" when the blind old lady with black sunglasses tells him to \"wait\" and sure enough Manni sees the person who stole the money from him. While Manni is chasing the bum he causes an unintentional accident in the street that hurts (punishes) Lola's rotten father as well as killing the thief who stole her motor scooter at the beginning of the film.God's wrath. Manni \"surrenders\" as well, giving his gun to the bum in exchange for the money.Manni, now gunless and useless as a criminal, gives the money to the crime boss, and meets Lola, who is waiting for him with a bag on money. She now realizes that not only is Manni saved from the fate of the crime boss, but she and Manni can both start an honest life together and not resort to crime seeing as how she has over 100,000 dm in a bag that is all theirs. The film ends with Lola smiling in joy as Manni simply asks: \"What's in the bag?\"THis is a masterpiece of fate, divine intervention, trying to take matters into our own hands, punishing the wicked and saving sinners. Yes, this movie is heavy on spirit and don't believe anyone who says otherwise. The theme of all the elements being used to facilitate either a disaster or salvation is so comprehensive and well-executed that even the the most angry-at-God person or atheist will be knocked down by how good this film is. Don't let foreign films scare you away. This is even a good film for a youth group for teens at a church! Yes it's in German and yes you will have to read subtitles. FYI, this review I just wrote has about as many words as all of the dialogue of the film so there...you see? You can do it. Miracles happen even to the viewers of Run Lola Run!JIM MACAYEAL",

If you're like me, you may be interested in reading reviews of a movie even after watching it - just in case you missed something important. In that case, you won't mind the spoilers.What I really like about this movie is how the three stories rate on the scale of being believable in contrast to our own aspirations and hopes. They all look pretty unbelievable at one point or another. Yet nothing seems less probable than the one with the happy ending, considering it involves winning at the casino 100% of the time, a 1 in a Million chance of some of the encounters. Yet we all prefer the happy ending over the other two stories. It's in our nature - to hope and have faith for the best. And when the movie ends, we're left with the happy ending feeling, even though that's only one third of what's portrayed here. Ironic - isn't it?",

    "review/text": "Since I first saw RUN LOLA RUN right aroung the same time as I did Michael Haneke's 1997 FUNNY GAMES, the two remain linked in my mind. Odd in a way, since I love this movie--and have watched it several times--and had quite the opposite reaction to the Haneke film, to the point where I refused to consider seeing the American re-make from 2008. But there was one significant aspect these two late-90s films shared: both films very deliberately called attention to the fact that they WERE indeed films: artificial representations of the real world, subject to authorial intervention and variation at almost any point in the plot.Tom Tykwer's LOLA is, in many ways, an extremely self-conscisous film. Its thrice-repeated basic plot, with extensive variations and elaborations, is a reminder that narratives can (and perhaps should) be subject to artistic manipulation or--as in Hollywood--to audience reactions at the test screenings. \"Don't like THAT ending? Try this one! Or this one. We must have something here you'd like--and would pay seven bucks a pop to see.\" RUN LOLA RUN is a movie for anyone who's ever compulsively watched every single alt-ending provided on a DVD. It works for the same reason that the various versions of any other narrative work. Endings are seldom neat and always subject to change. Any plot suggests its alternative versions, \"What if?\" says the audience, \"What if?\"LOLA lets the viewer in on the secret--and, to extent, on the decision making. This is a fiction, and you're not allowed to forget it. There could be something depressingly Sisyphean about Lola's desperate 20 minute run, except that the camerawork, the editing and the music are so faced paced and compelling that it's easy to forget the desperate situaion Lola and boyfriend Manni find themselves in and just enjoy the ride. After individual segments in which, first, Lola dies and, then, Manni does, we are primed and fully entitled to the fairytale happy ending the third segment brings. This is less Nietzsche' \"eternal return\" than George Harrison's \"with every mistake we must surely be learning.\"It is the exhilaration, the downright glee of possibility that keeps us engrossed in this hyperkinetic PoMo fairytale. And that's probably the reason why I so preferred it to FUNNY GAMES. The Haneke movie deliberately breaks from the narrative, tears down the fourth wall--or the moviehouse screen, if you prefer--about 3/4 of the way through. In that grimly violent film, which seems to marching relentlessly to a violently conclusion, this break comes as a real break for the emotionally exhausted viewer. But no sooner, does he break from the action than he picks right back up on it again. This story, he seems to say, HAS to end this way. It may be a fiction, but it must follow its own deadly internal logic.That was a nihilistic stance if there ever was one. By contrast, RUN LOLA RUN is almost sweetly Romantic. Fates are not sealed here. Fictions, like the real life that informs them, have infinite possibilities. all of which have an internal logic of their own. Third time's a charm for Lola and Manni.",

It was new, fresh and very different when it came out in the late '90s and still is unique and enjoyable as of this review in early 2009. The Blu-Ray edition, by the way, is terrific and worth the money. It looks tremendous.The movie is short - 81 minutes - but plenty long when you consider it's three versions of the same story, each version about 25 minutes after an opening introduction.That may sound too repetitive or boring for those who haven't seen this, but it is anything but overplayed thanks to the innovative camera-work and interesting angles on the same story. Watching it on DVD was better than the theater because the 5.1 sound is superior, plus you have the option of a good dubbed version or the original German with English subtitles. I use either, depending on my mood but I lean toward the German with subtitles.Franke Potente, who has since gone on to become better known around the world from the \"Bourne\" films, is the centerpiece of this film and very, very interesting. The looks of shock on her face, her flaming red hair and wild general appearance and the crazy things that happen to her are always fun to watch and hear.Added to the unique cinematography, which includes tricks here and there, is a pulsating electronic soundtrack that brings added life to this already kinetic, involving film.The high rating I give this film could really be summed up in two words: DIFFERENT and FUN.",

    "review/text": "This heart-pumping, frantic, postmodern German film models itself after a video game, where different choices lead down different paths, to different conclusions, all within the control of the player. And yet, this film is so much more than that.Franka Potente plays clown-haired Lola, a young woman in love with bumbling Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) and who finds herself racing against the clock to scrounge up the vast sum of 100,000 marks to save Manni's life. As she runs through Berlin, she bumps into various people, whose fates are shown in flashes of slideshows, who may help or hinder her. The soundtrack is thumping, almost minimalist, with a voice droning over Lola's high-stakes sprint, and it keeps the viewer as breathless as Lola herself.Because this film messes with the viewer's mind, the plot cannot be fully described without revealing spoilers. Suffice it to say that viewers will have their expectations changed at every step. The production standards are not Hollywood-slick, but director Twyker adeptly portrays both the desperate and the sweet in this story, with brilliant cinematography that takes this film to a high level. As the depth of Lola's and Manni's relationship is revealed, the character form the heart of this surprising, thought-provoking film.Watch this more than once. You'll love it.",

I highly recommend you see this film. You may not enjoy it as much as many other people do, but at least give it a shot and find out for yourself!",

You can literally sense the excitement the director must have had making this film...and it makes me want to get up and run! I like how it shows how one person, one star-crossed heartbeat can run into different lives, setting off an explosion of events and consequences. Also a tip, while viewing this DVD DO NOT watch the optional English Audio version unless you are up for a good laugh. The original German audio with English subtitles is so much better. The film evokes humor, excitment, and mabye a tear in a few scenes. A great all around film, fast-paced and exciting, don't miss it.",

The plot is engaging, fast paced, well written, and packed with enough detail to bring you back again and again. While a viewer might easily enjoy the film simoply on the basis of the staccato story line, it might also be savored for its thorough and precise treatment of Nietzche's concept of eternal return. Triggering thoughts in me similar to those experienced while reading Milan Kundera's &quot;Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; I was pleasingly surprised by the true exactitude of the plot. Not a word, a shot, an image, or a second is wasted.",

As a Store Manager in a BLockbuster video, as well as a movie buff, I know thats hard to believe, but it's true. A co-worker suggested I watch Run Lola Run, claiming it was the best film he'd ever seen. I didn't want to see it because I figured I would be too busy reading the subtitles to even notice the action. I was so wrong. This movie was fast paced and fun. I didn't even notice the subtitles after a while. It put Sliding Doors to shame. The lead, Lola (who was brilliantly cast) has 20 minutes to get her boyfriend money he owes some notorious thug. The movie takes us through the twists and turns of everyday life. It was a little artsy, but not to the point that it will turn you off. You will find yourself rooting for Lola, and feeling just about as breathless as she does. It is an incredable movie and it will not let you down.",

    "review/text": "After watching Lola Rennt for the fifth time, its safe to say that this is an excellently written; an excellently directed; and an excellently acted movie. All of these aspects of the movie come together, fit perfectly, work perfectly together to make a excellent movie. This fast paced German masterpeice should be the one movie in '99/00 you should not miss out. The movie was recently released on Video, so if you were not fortunate enough to see it in theatres, be sure to go down to your local video store to pick it up.The movie is based around Lola (Franka Potente) who must save her boyfriend from certain death, and do it in twenty minutes while picking up 20 000 marks on the way there. As I don't want to go too deeply into the plot, I will stop there, if you want to learn more please read the spoiler section of the reviews.Not too go to deeply into it again, the movie is of Lola running througout a German city to get from place to place to collect money in time. THe camera work on the running scene's is fast paced. Different and interesting camera angles and perspectives make this movie a sight to see.The story itself, simple enough, is helped out by the use of symbolism thoughout the movie. While watching try to pick up on some of these symbols in it. Even after watching it five times there are still things that can be missed. I've talked to many fans of the movie that have pointed out some of these aspects of them film. It really is something you must see for yourself.",

Watching the different versions of Lola's run through town, we can see that the lives of various secondary characters take dramatically different turns depending on such apparently innocuous details as whether Lola runs by at a certain point in time or five seconds later. Yet the fate of Lola and her boyfriend, Manni, always seem to be the same. This is a rewarding film whether you or in the mood to ponder such issues or just to be entertained.",

Just because it's in German doesn't mean you have to know german to see it! I, personally, would recomend the subtitle version. That way you can really tell what they feel through their voices. I have heard it compared to Groundhog's Day and i consider that a crime. Groundhog's Day was a meaningless, horribly boring movie that had no feeling. Run, Lola, Run is actually interesting. Lola must help her boyfriend, Manni, somehow get 100,000 marks in 20 minutes before he has to meet his boss. If he doesn't show up with the money he will get killed. After the first try the movie suddenly goes back to the beginning and Lola deals with a totally different outcome. After the second try, again the movie goes back to the beginning and the movie finally ends with a happy medium, after 2 shots at one extreme or the other. The techno background music helps with the excitement of the plot. This is a movie I definately recommend, even if you just rent it the first time...

What if Lola borrows the money from her father? What will happen? - It's a great movie that enforces the law of nature that every action has a reaction and every step in life that we take affects the next. I really enjoyed this film.

However this devotion is not forced down the viewer's throat and most of the movie you believe you are watching a suspense drama when really you are watching diferent fates of a woman in love. A must have for anyone who loves good cinema, foreign films, love stories, suspense, or just a plain good flick.",

I managed to catch it at the cinema in Seattle a couple of months back and I was blown away by its originality and general awesomeness. I'd say it's the best German film I've ever seen, but it doesn't have much competition since it's pretty much the *only* German film I've ever seen. The story revolves around Lola (Franka Potente), a spiky-haired teenage tearaway, who needs to scrape together 100,000 DM in twenty minutes in order to save her waster boyfriend's life. The structure the director uses to present Lola's hectic adventures is really original - we see her attempting the same task three different times, each time with a few events differing and resulting in hugely varying eventual outcomes. I won't spoil it by giving the plot(s) away, but the end result is an excellent film. The soundtrack is very cool too - lots of suitably high-speed techno, in the style of Underworld.",

That is the problem our red headed heroine faces in RUN LOLA RUN. This is one of the best films I have seen. It is fast paced (in fact there are only a few moments where the film slows down and allows you to catch your breath), and with each run that we see, the world is affected differently. It is truely a work of art when you see how director Tykwer makes Lola's run affect people differently. In one scene, Lola is nearly hit by a car but manages to roll on top of the hood and avoids being hurt (however the car then runs into another car.) But the next time, Lola doesn't make it over the car and stops the driver, who then misses running into the same car. RUN LOLA RUN the DVD is loaded with features that can greatly affect a person's outlook on the film. The commontary is superb and explanes one what the signifigance of one of the quotes that opens the film. There is also a music video from the song that is the basis for the film, Believe.

But the trick is taking a step back from the plot to see what the movie is really about: Fate, chance, and how twisting one tiny little occurence can spiral a &quot;predetermined&quot; course of events in an entirely different direction. This movie has nothing to do with its plot.The music and images make this a truly beautiful movie to witness, and it's so far held up to repeat viewings without boring me in the least.

Franka makes the movie work however, she completely sells you on the urgency of her situation, she is great to watch. A bonus part of the DVD is a music video with her in it - minus the red hair - it is worth watching. The DVD also offers up different subtitle choices, stick with the German language version and rely on the English subtitles, it's much better that way. One last cool feature is commentary provided by the director, Tom Tykwer, and Franka but it gets a little annoying after awhile - you really have to be a detailed fan to really enjoy it (a interview with them would have been cooler). If you haven't seen it already - rent it first, you'll probably end up buying it if you like something a little different. Enjoy!",

He contacts his loving girlfriend Lola and as soon as she leaves the door to the apartment the movie rarely slows down. The movie then shows us three alternate and equally entertaining results to the situation.One of the more interesting innovation was the fact that the movie shows us how the lives of seemingly insignificant characters are affected by their run-ins with Lola. By the third time, since these characters are significant, you just don't care. Techno music never sounded more appropriate(I'm not sure that's a good thing) as it is a good companion to the fast and sometimes exhausting pace of the movie.The movie had style to spare and enough substance so that's why I liked it very much.",

I am not interested in anything in between; I am not interested in all those films that do not pulse.&quot; Tom Tykwer, the director of Run!Lola!Run!, knows exactly what Truffault was getting at. His 88 minute landmark film from Germany does what most movies fail to do. That is, ASTONISH US! I have not seen another film this year(or for several previous years) where the director's love of filmaking is revealed in each shot. In brief, the film centers around a young woman trying to come up with 100, 000 marks in twenty minutes to try to save her boyfriend who messed up a drug deal. The film gives three versions of the execution and outcome. But to mention &quot;the plot&quot; only does this movie injustice. Like with all movies, a film is not juged good or bad on what it is about. It is judged on how it is about what it is about. Tykwer does not use the three different scenario technique as a ploy. Each new version of the story makes us think about the past actions of its characters while, at the same time, revealing something new about them. What makes Run!Lola!Run! special, of course, is its style. In a way, this is the perfect movie to end the century. It looks back to a tradition(i.e-pulp plot, &quot;love conquers all theme&quot;) while looking to the future(i.e-fast-forward freeze-frame, animation). Furthermore, the director uses music the same way Scorsese, Tarantino, and Kenneth Anger do. Not to drown the images on the screen, but to heighten and enhance them. Run!Lola!Run! is by a filmaker who is in love with filmaking. I cannot wait for his next movie. Unfortunately, Hollywood directors will try to copy and follow Tom Tykwer. However, like Pauline Keal said(when referring to director Jean-Luc Godard) they can't walk behind him because he has already &quot;burned up the ground.&quot;",

    "review/text": "Like an extended music video, Run Lola Run is one of those visceral movies that can be watched passively for while but before long it gets under your skin making your heart pound your lungs heave and your mind race. Tom Tykwer's direction and writing turned out a fantastic film that is pure action. This is a foreign film but its concept and style are close to home. Using the universal appeal of driving beats, as well as techno tunes and fast action photography this film is one that immediately grabs hold of teens and young adults and older people too! Franka Potente is powerful in this film. She is aesthetically pleasing (as always) and really makes the film enjoyable to watch. The dialogue is quite simple and you need not know a lick of German except maybe die tasche (the bag) which is a line used often throughout.The film is centered on a young arty couple who are in need of money to pay off a loan after getting the. I am not going to give away a single plot detail because it may make the movie less enjoyable. However the movie is in fact three different scenarios of what happens in their pursuit of get back the money. Not all of these scenarios end happily. I have always imagined the movie as the imaginings of the couple as they plan and go through the contingencies of getting money.Stylistically this movie is shot a lot like a music video and is more emotionally stimulating than is an intellectual one.Its adrenalizing driving feel is refreshing especially considering it is a foreign film. So often foreign films are intellectual or just quaint. Not here. The only omission I would have made was the use of the animations that run in a few parts. They aren't bad and do not heavily detract but they are a little bit like something out of the `80's. But overall, the heavy use of high energy volume fast action shots, aggressive dialogue against a relatively austere urban German backdrop that accentuates the action makes this such a fun film to watch.Beware when watching this movie you will probably want to do some cardio and this makes a great one to watch while on the treadmill if you have such a set up. This movie is pumped with energy and is a great point of entry into foreign film. It is one that is highly accessible very stimulating and good for a wide audience. I highly recommend you see this one: Its style pushed the envelope of what a film can be and is truly a masterpiece. The DVD offers a few extras and English audio which makes it all the more easy to watch.-- Ted Murena",

    "review/text": "Tom Tykwer has truly proven himself as the filmmaker to watch. The little known German director has produced a modern-day masterpiece; a dazzling technical film about how life consists of the decisions we make.Lola (Franka Potente) receives a phone call from her boyfriend, Manni. (Moritz Bleibtreii) Manni accidentally leaves a bag carrying $100 000 on a train, which is picked up by a homeless man. This leaves Manni in quite a predicament. He is supposed to deliver the money to a gangster by noon, if he fails, then he is likely to be killed. Lola has twenty- minutes to save his boyfriend. Twenty short minutes to somehow find the money and get it to him.Run Lola Run is a film you expect to see at a Independent film festival, or in a Professor's office at a film school. In no way do I mean that in a negative way, I mean not to intend that the film is of a lower standard with lower production values, rather that the film is a beautifully mastered technical film that uses every filmmaking technique in the book. It is refreshing to see a film like this in the midst of the commercialised, dry-cut, 'traditional' filmmaking that we see on the silver screen so regularly.As stated before, the film attempts to use a wide range of filmmaking techniques to help get the director's meaning and vision across to the audience. Some of these include speed-up, instant replay, black and white, and even animation in some parts.It may sound strange, but the film is twenty-minutes long. Well, not really, but it is in context. Tykwer focuses on the twenty-minutes that Lola has, and shows that twenty-minutes three times over, each time with small differences will affect the outcome of the characters. The danger with this kind of technique is that it can threaten to be repetitive. However, the new additions added by Tykwer are very clever and link in perfectly, which will have you gasping for more.Tykwer wrote and directed this film, and while doing this, he never lost sight of his meaning. His meaning that he is trying to express is that life consists of the decisions we make. While watching the film, this becomes increasingly evident. He also likes to emphasise that time is against Lola during the film. This can be seen when a young woman walks past and Lola asks her for the time, the next shot shows a much older woman answering her question, hence showing the importance of time.Franka Potente gave a good performance as Lola. Yet, it is hard to say that she was fantastic, because it is a role that requires a great deal of physical acting and we didn't get to know a lot about Lola, hence the film wasn't overly-focusing on her issues, rather her boyfriend's problem. The real standout performance from my point of view came from Moritz Bleibtreii. He actually took on a quite challenging role and pulls it off successfully. He achieves his objective of getting the audience to feel sympathy for the position that he is in.Run Lola Run is without a doubt, one of the best technical films ever made. A profound, exciting, new age masterpiece that has well and truly left its mark on the film industry.",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run is a fun, fast paced, and uniquely styled movie.The plot centers around Lola frantically trying to get money and deliver it to her boyfriend within 20 minutes.The movie repeats three such attempts, all with Lola starting at the same place, but with very different results each time -- not only for her, but for others in her wake.The plot sounds basic but is actually fast paced with lots of interesting and, after the first pass, familiar scenes with twists, how bystanders in the background are affected by her passing, etc.Imagine if today at breakfast you spilled some milk, which delayed you by 30 seconds in leaving your house, which placed you in an intersection in your car 30 seconds later, which caused you to narrowly avoid a collision... Now reset the day, don't spill the milk... What happens now?Each of the three Run Lola Run sequences is off just a little, but then you see the differences to Lola (and passers in the street) created by these subtle changes...Fascinating to watch and insightful into how much each of us can ultimately (and unknowingly) affect each others lives.The soundtrack to the movie is excellent and maintains the fast pace of the movie superbly.I liked the start of each of the three sequences when Lola starts running down the hall of her house. The camera view follows her and then spins off away from her path into the living room where her mother is sitting -- analogous to a wind vortex spinning off the edge of an airplanes wing and affecting passing bird -- sets the stage nicely for the scenes to follow.Run Lola Run is an excellent cause and effect movie. It doesn't get hung up in time travel, sci-fi, or even why this is happening. It is just a fun ride, great visuals, music, and a little food for thought along the way.The movie is best watched in the original language (German) with subtitles turned on as necessary. The subtitles were clear and easy to read at all times.Definitely worth watching.",

    "review/summary": "This Is NOT Groundhog Day!!!!!",
    "review/text": "I don't know how the comparison got started, but Groundhog Day resembles Lola Rennt (its original German title) about as much as much as cooking sherry resembles a good merlot. Both will get you drunk, and how you get there is up to you -- but the low-rent route may not agree with your stomach all that well. This may sound as if I'm getting ready to slam Groundhog Day -- not at all. It was a good movie, though not great, but there was a certain amount of formula to it -- i.e., Bill Murray plays one of his stock cynical jerk characters, who because of an extraordinary series of circumstances, undergoes a complete personality facelift by the movie's end. This is all well and good, and it makes for a fun movie -- but nobody will ever confuse it with a really classic comedy like It Happened One Night.Okay, so how does all this blathering relate to Lola Rennt? Well, as I said, the comparison is absurd, a true case of apples and oranges if ever I've seen one. GD was a comedy which pretended to have serious overtones; Lola on the other hand is a serious, experimental film which refuses to take itself all that seriously. It has a definite sense of humor about itself, and even seems to parody itself at certain points. Also, Groundhog Day is about a man trapped in repeating the same day over and over again -- whereas Lola (and this is where the confusion started, I think) is about a woman faced with a difficult choice, who runs through possible scenarios of how her choices will work out -- but (and I wish I could use italics here to emphasize this) only the last of these occurs in real life! The first two are Lola running through these possible events in her own mind, speculating on how it will go -- will I get killed, will my boyfriend get killed, etc.? This is a small but crucial point that a lot of people seem to miss, and it's also the biggest reason why Lola Rennt is cut from a completely different cloth than Groundhog Day.So, having said all that, let me now talk about the movie. The plot is simple: Lola's boyfriend Manni loses 100,000 Marks through a stupid accident (it's made obvious straightaway that Manni isn't the brightest bulb in the lamp), and Lola must help him come up with the cash in 20 minutes or he will die. There then follows three separate versions of how that happens, two speculative on Lola's part, the final one the way it really happens. Subtle and major changes happen in each successive version of these events, but the connecting thread between all three is that Lola must run to get where she is going. I won't spoil the fun for you by telling all that happens, save that one involves blackmail, another involves a robbery, while the third involves a coincidence that stretches the bounds of believability. Franka Potente is amazing in the title role -- she's a very good actor, and handles the physically demanding role with ease. More than one review has compared what she does to Olympic-quality athleticism, and I have to agree.The film itself, both in terms of script and direction, is highly imaginative -- and you don't have to be a pseudo-intellectual, as one of the other reviewers suggested, to appreciate it. There are lots of lovely touches throughout -- the way the car accident happens differently each time, the hobo on the bicycle, the Bergmanesque conversations between Lola's father and his lover. Best of all are the brilliant &quot;AND THEN:&quot; sequences, which in several seconds of snapshots show the possible futures of minor characters and extras in the film, which again are different every time, and which swing wildly from hilarity and irony to tragedy and chilling sorrow. These are some of the movie's best moments, and they really add to the pulsing rhythms of the main story. Another nice touch is Lola's scream, which shatters glass -- suggesting that Lola has become a force of nature, and woe betide the poor S.O.B. who gets in her way. These moments make you laugh, but the laughter is of a decidedly nervous variety, because you sense that such tremendous passion will lead Lola to trouble (as if it hasn't already, considering what her unreasoning love for Manni has led her into!).A lot of &quot;art-house&quot; films have the tendency to take themselves way (and I mean WAY) too seriously; Lola Rennt, if anything, almost goes too far in the opposite direction. It does a lot of its work with a sly-wink-and-a-nod feel that is amusing (and as I said above, there are moments of self-parody that are very good), but this playful tone at times almost upends the story's more serious aspects. That, along with the hard-to-swallow moments in the third storyline, has led me to give Lola Rennt four stars instead of five. However, it's still head and shoulders above most of the other experimental art films I've seen lately. I wholeheartedly reccommend it to you, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

    "review/text": "&quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is the first german film in years, that became a huge hit outside the teutonic territory, and rightly so. &quot;Lola rennt&quot; (original title) is an enormously entertaining fun ride that starts at full speed and never lets up.Unlike most films, this one tells a story of 20 minutes in 80 minutes. The normal approach in movies is just vice versa. The film can do this by telling the same story three times. Each time, small details vary and that leads to an entirely different conclusion of the story. This gives the film some weight in the intelectual arena as well and makes it more than a technical triumph. The cast is another plus. Franka Potente is now something of a star in Germany, as is director Tom Tykwer. The media is already hailing him as a possible saviour of the german film, which puts a lot of pressure on him.&quot;Lola&quot; is a picture that succeeds in being entertaining and thought-provoking. There is little more one can expect from a movie. Gut gemacht, Herr Tykwer!",

    "review/text": "There are already enough reviews of the excellent film and the acting Franka Potente, so I'm going to focus on the DVD itself.And that said, this is a DVD that is worth owning. The transfer is of very high quality. And considering that the film is running at such a fast pace with images being thrown in and out of the camera's view, the high quality transfer really is essential to the film. Even if the film was bad (and I think the other reviews can convince you that it isn't), the transfer is done so well that it allows you to marvel at the wonders of DVD (and make you happy that you haven't used that old VCR in quite some time).But the transfer quality pales in comparison to the sound in Run Lola Run. And whomever made Run Lola Run onto DVD was kind enough to take into consideration that not everybody has a full surround sound setup just yet. So the film is made in both 2.0 and 5.1 for both English and German. It's amazing how many films don't do this. The 2.0 sound is actually good enough to sound better than some poorly made DVD's with 5.1. But Run Lola Run's 5.1 sound is excellent. I'd imagine you'd have to be a fan of the techno beats in Run Lola Run to really appreciate it, but if you're at least a little bit into the music, you'll love being right in the middle of the sound as it does take advantage of the rear speakers quite a bit. I'd strongly recomend using the subtitles and listening to the German 5.1 over the English 5.1. The English 5.1 sounds just fine, but the German is clearly better.The special features are good, but not great. The commentary with director Tykwer and Potente is better than most. At least it is for an American not fully familiar with German cinema -- the commentary gives you some insight as to how films are made on the other side of the pond. The music video is neat, but I can't imagine watching it more than a couple of times.When my friends look at my collection of DVD's and ask me why I'm &quot;wasting&quot; my money on them when I have several of the movies on tape, Run Lola Run is one of the DVD's that I'll pop in to show them what DVD can really do. A strongly recommended purchase -- especially for those who own high quality systems.",

Little choices and big choices can have untold effects on one's life and the lives of others. That is what this movie is about.To get these ideas across, we meet Lola and her current boyfriend. They are shady characters in that they are involved in illegal activities. Lola is the real thinker and the one who maintains control. Lola is late and the boyfriend gets in trouble. He gets scared and loses the money he is supposed to deliver to a drug lord. He has twenty minutes until delivery time. He turns to Lola. She has twenty minutes to come up with the money and get to him.Lola runs. She runs and runs. Her mind races for solutions even as her feet race across the city. She interacts with a number of characters. Some of these are affected by her and we get glimpses of their futures. There are two pauses in the film where Lola and her boyfriend are discussing important issues. In the first, Lola asks if he loves her. In the second he asks what she would do if he dies. While these at first seem strange ways of dividing the film's three separate sections, they give great insight into the characters.As the film progresses, we also get to see what can happen when some of the choices that were made are changed. What new paths can occur. Who get affected. All in all, it is simply brilliant.",

    "review/summary": "A brilliantly innovative cinematic masterpiece",
    "review/text": "I have always tried very hard not to say a movie was awesome, but I feel compelled to say that this German gem from 1999 is as awesome as awesome can be. I've never seen anything like Run, Lola, Run; it's a film that doesn't sound as if it should really work, yet its presentation is dazzling and mesmerizing. Franka Potente gives an incredible performance, her talents as visible as her bright pink hair. There's nothing misleading about the title. Lola runs and runs some more; Franka Potente could probably have tried out for the German Olympic team after all the running she had to do here.The strengths of this movie are its unique vision, stunning cinematography, and pulse-pounding soundtrack, but here's a breakdown of the plot. Lola (Potente) and Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) are in love, and like most couples in love we find the man doing something really stupid and blaming the woman. Manni does a little work for a mafia-type fellow, and his latest job involves the delivery of one hundred thousand marks to his boss. Lola was supposed to meet him in town, but she was late, and Manni ended up accidentally (yet still very stupidly) leaving his bag o' cash on a train for a bum to pick up and run off with. Now he has twenty minutes to come up with one hundred thousand marks before having to face Mr. Big. Lola was late because her bike was stolen, yet of course the whole mess is her fault, according to Manni. I'll cut the guy some slack here, though; knowing you are about to be rubbed out tends to put a little stress on the system. Lola takes off, trying to come up with the money and get it to Manni before the top of the hour. Lest you think the film cannot last longer than thirty minutes tops, just know that there is something a little bit different about Lola; the old saw &quot;if you don't succeed, try, try again&quot; takes on special meaning with this girl, and the transitions of what might be considered silly by some are handled very, very well.Run, Lola, Run does much to show us how our decisions impact both ourselves and those around us, even strangers, in a big, big way. The movie provides us with a quick series of revealing snapshots of the future lives of several individuals who cross Lola's path, and it is really quite fascinating to see how these peeks at the future differ under slightly different circumstances. One may not be able to say that fate is kind or unkind, but she (fate) is certainly capricious. Irony abounds here, just as in life. The visual presentation of this film is just stunning, combining all sorts of illustrative elements. There is an animation sequence that mimics part of Lola's run, split screen shots of two scenes at once, and almost dizzying camera pans that do indeed compare with a lot of the elements of music videos. The whole movie is also infused with a powerful, beating soundtrack (a significant portion of which is provided by Franka Potente herself) that never allows the viewer to take a breath; there is very little danger of your nodding off while watching this cinematic masterpiece. Voted the best film by the audience at the Sundance Film Festival of 1999, Run, Lola, Run is a visionary piece of cinematic art that every lover of good movies should see.",

    "review/text": "I see hundreds of movies a year, but somehow, I had managed to miss RUN LOLA RUN until the first week in August, 2005. YEARS after the film had come out, and years after imitators had their shots at ruining the style (like imitators of PULP FICTION kinda cheapened that whole genre). Not to fear...this film is a kick of PURE ENERGY!!I felt honest-to-God jazzed watching this movie. Originality and ENERGY pop off the screen. Basically, we're watching three little movies...each of the same scenario, but playing out in different ways. We see how one or two tiny little changes early on can snowball into HUGE changes once the story reaches its end. Lola has to come up with a HUGE pile of money in 20 minutes flat, or her boyfriend will either be killed by a mobster, or take the foolish step of holding up a grocery store for the cash. Can she \"fix\" his problem in time? That's about the plot...but this summary tells you NOTHING about how this film feels.I'm a 41 year old man. Not the target audience. I don't listen to the kind of music played here (techno...for lack of a better word). I speak some German, but not enough that I didn't have to read the subtitles. I always look for holes in the plot of films. I'm always skeptical of \"artiness for its own sake.\" And yet, while the film is \"artful,\" I thought it was a perfect blending of a filmmaking style with a story-telling intent. Lola is under a deadline...and everything reminds us of that. The pulsing, repetitive score...the fast camera work...the color choices...everything.But the best part of all is Franke Potente, the star of the film. US audiences know her from the \"girlfriend\" role in BOURNE IDENTITY...and she was the best cast part of the film...she seemed real, smart, sexy, foreign and fully-realized. In RUN LOLA RUN, she shows why an American director casting a big-budget American film would have gone with her...she's GREAT! The film spends many minutes focused just on Lola running. From the side, from head-on...we see her run, run, run. Red/pink hair sailing wildly behind. Her face is a masterpiece...at one moment she's got fear, intelligence, determination and exhaustion etched there. She's very young, and in over her head...but we immediately want her to succeed as much as SHE wants to succeed. It's a riveting performance in a film full of fun ideas.If I sit back and think about it...I realize that what Lola is running for is to save a criminal boyfriend (who's also stupid and a bit of a whiner), and that performing criminal acts is not beyond her either. Most of the characters she encounters along her way (especially her father and his mistress), are quite unlikeable too. From a surface level, we should have NO business getting behind these schmucks. But Lola's ferocity is an undeniable magnet. And the film moves WAY too fast to do anything but leave you breathless.It's rated \"R,\" mostly for some strong language, and for some unsavory scenes with the father and mistress. I don't recommend it by any stretch for kids...but I suggested it to my 17 year old son, and he loved it. He's showing it to his friends. It's a COOL movie...simply put. It deserves all the accolades that have come its way.",

    "review/text": "1999 was a good year for the movies. The Sixth Sense, the Blair Witch Project, American Beauty. Oh, yes, there was this little German film that few had heard of before the Sundance festival: LOLA RENNT (English title: RUN LOLA RUN).Directed by Tom Twyker, whose past releases in this reviewers opinion aren't really notable, and starring Franka Potente, Run Lola Run brought new respect to German filmmaking, which has previously been (fairly) characterized as deliberate, slow paced, and self-absorbed in a bad way.Run Lola Run is about action. From 10 seconds into the opening credits through to the end -- punctuated only with a few brief intermissions to let you catch your breath -- the director grabs you and drags you along a whirlwind journey. Three times. You'll enjoy the ride each time.There's one moment, when you begin the rollercoaster ride for the second time, when you'll say to yourself &quot;oh no, I'm going to have to watch this again. This is going to hurt.&quot; And within 8 seconds Twyker shifts gears on you and shows you how Lola's journey changes others and herself in different ways each time.I don't want to spoil too much of the plot, so I'll give you the barest outline: Lola's boyfriend Manni has lost 100,000 Deutschmarks that his gangster boss is coming to collect in 20 minutes. Lola has to run across town to find 100,000 DM, and reach Manni, before time runs out.The soundtrack is unparalleled. The filmmaking is superb. The acting is flawless -- every supporting actor strikes the perfect note. This is the movie I would want to be stuck on a desert island with. If you get the DVD version, you'll also get one of the most interesting directors commentaries available. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone that is human.",

Without giving away too much the story revolves around Lola and her Boyfriend (Manni) in a bid to get 100,000 Marks in 20 minutes to save Manni from a rather unpleasant encounter with some thugs. The film moves at a fast pace as it replays the same 20 minutes over and over each showing how actions even trivial ones may have a profound effects on others. For example in one running Lola bumps into a woman and that triggers a series of events that causes the woman to lose her child to protective services which leads her to kidnap a baby. In another running she merely brushes past the woman and the woman ends up winning the lottery and lives happily ever after.Far from being bored with the replaying of the 20 minutes the move keeps your attention as you watch for the discrepancies between the runs. You find yourself asking was that element in the previous run? Why is that person walking there? Do they have a part in a future running? Just when you think you know everything about the runs the final run still has eye openers...The DVD has an English soundtrack that almost makes you feel that your not watching a foreign language film at all with the action and the sound track being so in sync.",

Tom Tykwer shows brilliance as the film's director; his use of close-ups of these not-perfect faces is exceptional. &quot;Lola&quot; is a film that one can enjoy watching over and over again, so it is a worthwhile addition to a DVD collection. As someone who primarily enjoys classical music and opera, I was thrilled by the techno-trance music of the film's soundtrack. I recommend that viewers watch this film in the German version, with the English subtitles, because it is very easy to understand the film this way and adds to its authenticity. And it only gets better. The movie is told in three segments, each with different aspects and outcomes. Overall, this is definitely one of those films that gets better each time you watch it, a totally original, undiscovered treasure.",

Its a good thing for him that he has a strong woman behind him. With her fire engine red hair, Lola is so powerful that she breaks glass when she screams, she can heal the dying, and she won't even let the movie end until everything in her life is right.This film is refreshingly feminist foward, in that the leading actor is a woman who is in flux and must &quot;save the day&quot;. The whole plot and story line depend on the actions of this 20~something punky woman. This edge of your seat, heart stopping adventure draws you in by letting you know that it could be you up there running to help your boy/girlfriend. Also, this film puts the ART back in Arthouse with its punk rock style, its multiple outcomes and a 'choose your own adventure' ending style. How many ways can one major screw up end up? Will Lola and Manni live happily ever after? Will there be laughter or tears? Hmmmm.Director Tykwer has fashioned a massively impressive, music video styled film that also stops long enough to enrich each character, adding layers as the story is revisited. He also relentlessly toys with the medium, including giving flash-forward life-stories to mere extras (very humorous and witty) and running the credits backward. Tremendous fun, hugely entertaining. Only Grinches and prunes will not fall madly in love with this witty, fast paced winner! Run, and I mean RUN! to the Check out with this film! (tee-hee)",

    "review/text": "I have not watched a lot of foreign films so I thought I'd grab Run Lola, Run. It's a surreal film in a lot of ways. Even before we get to the star crossed lovers who get in over their heads with a fencing mob operation, the film wobbles through crowds of people asking about Man, the way he questions, the answers leading to more questions, in a circular philosophy.The camera focuses on a few of the people who will later play larger roles later in the film. Finally, a security guard says \"Scheisse\" happens and kicks a soccer ball high in the air!We fly with the ball, and then come down to Lola's world. As you've read in other reviews and synopses, it's basically about Lola's boyfriend, who explains that during a fencing operation with some diamonds, he sold the diamonds to a fence for 100,000 Marks, and now he only has twenty minutes before meeting the mob boss who will kill Manni (her boyfriend) when the boss finds out Manni lost the money on the subway.\"And it's all your fault for being late!\" he yells at her which was really not fair, being the irresponsible dork that he really is. But I digress!Hitchcock has always said that rather than having a bunch of talking heads in a film, that one should use the cinema as a way of communicating (or words to that effect) and Lola definitely delivers.First, Lola actually has a power or two. First, she can run for miles without being hardly out of breath. And two, she can scream with such intensity that she can break glass.There are actually three scenarios or 20 minute clips that show the various fates of Lola and the people she runs across.In the first one, she screams and shatters mirrors! Then she throws the phone up in the air and it lands flawlessly on the phone cradle. Then she runs! There is some animation in here too as well as some cool electronic music to keep us moving. A few seconds difference in running into a neighbor's dog makes a woman who was delayed by this now win the lottery. Makes a bike thief become a bum. And so on!Manni wants to rob a store to get the money. Lola fails with her cheating father and helps Manni rob the store. She comes to a bad end.In the second one, much as the first, she throws the phone into the air, lands flawlessly on the cradle, but this time (to make a long story short) Manni meets an untimely fate.In the third one, when all parties are more or less behaving themselves and are doing good for others, things turn out the best. At least for Lola and Manni.The DVD has French and English subtitles if you want, as well as voice-over English and French. I chose the English and it went quite smoothly.Interesting too that the credits roll UP as opposed to American films rolling down. Wild stuff. Understandable why this film won the Audience Award at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival.So run, do not walk, to your favorite DVD store and pick this up!Other Franka Potente (Lola) Films:The Princess and the WarriorCreepBourne Identity (Single-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)",

As I add additions I screen them to make sure the DVD plays properly. In this instance I screened the movie for co-workers during lunch and dinner breaks. \"Lola\" was well received by those who had not seen it before. I think it's a terrific example of an alternative (foreign or otherwise) to mega budget (or even mid to low budget fodder) movies especially those with huge stars, and an over abundance of special effects, which play as if they were written for and by marketing robots.If you can get \"Lola\" on sale do check it out",

If you are a fan of the Simpsons, you will have noticed that there was even a reference to Run Lola Run in an episode with Lisa and her robot, Linguo. It's simply an amazing movie that everyone knows about. there are many cool aspects to the movie: first, franka potente has awesome hair and is a really good actress, very convincing. second, the movie is made up of 3 different scenarios (all of which are really intense and enthralling, an \"edge of your seat\" movie) and it's rare to see a movie like that, especially an american movie. third, the characters are all pretty well developed and although most of it is her running (awesome that a movie title actually reflects what's going to happen in the movie for once), whenever faced with a character, you are really drawn deeper into their personality. dont be wary of the subtitles. movies with subtitles are easy to get into. you dont even notice you're reading them after the first 10 minutes. subtitles are actually pretty great because they allow you to hear the movie how it should be heard, but still be able to understand it. they are MUCH better than voice-overs. in a nutshell, SEE THIS MOVIE!",

    "review/text": "If you are like me, you are probably sick and tired of all the crap that Hollywood throws out year to year. There is no originality left in Hollywood, rather just conventionality. Most movies today are cycling through the same themes, plots, motifs, and archetypes of yesterday's movies. The German film Run Lola Run, however, has taken an original approach, separating it from the common Hollywood movie.First, in the movie you are shown three different scenarios with 3 very different outcomes. The idea the director plays on is that acting different in any one point in one's life can lead to startling outcomes - that every act is important and has its effect. In the movie, Lola, the main character, has twenty minutes to get her boyfriend a hundred thousand dollars cash, otherwise he will be killed. Acting slightly different each time she brings about shocking outcomes for both herself and her boyfriend. Hollywood movies on the other hand, will stick to one scenario, showing you how events would occur in one perspective. In reality, things never work out as well as they do in the movies. Hollywood will never account for life's many obstacles. Furthermore, the one-perspective- Hollywood-movie is usually the same perspective as all other movies from the past and present.Aside from the three-scenario plot, the movie also incorporates deep symbolism, which cannot be found in Hollywood. No matter how many times you watch this movie you can find more symbolism. For example, in the scenario where Lola is killed, many items are noticeably red, such as the color of her hair. In another scenario, when her boyfriend is killed, many items are noticeably yellow, like the color of his hair. Dissecting more of the movie, you find more and more symbolism in everything from names, to the moneybags, to the use of green as a symbol for money. By contrast, in the typical Hollywood movie you are hard pressed to find just a few symbols.Finally, the movie leaves the audience in a state of inquiry. You question whether it is better to make decisions based on intuition rather than reason. You question the merit of reincarnation. You question whether someone can will something to happen. Most Hollywood movies leave you with the typical happy ending, all questions answered. The whole reason writers write is to force you to examine a theme. Walking out of a Hollywood movie you are not forced to think about some aspect of life or human behavior. More often than not, the only question you are looking to answer is why did I watch this?In my personal opinion, the movie Run Lola Run is an original movie, surpassing the typical Hollywood film. The movie gathers a wide fan base because of its unique plot setup, its hefty and intricate use of symbolism, and its ability to leave the audience in a deep state of inquiry. I recommend that anyone seventeen years and older go see this movie (the movie is rated \"R\"). If you want to get the most out of this movie watch it as many times as you can...",

    "review/text": "Turn on your TV and buckle up for an exhilarating 80-minute ride. From the get-go, this film literally runs and barely pauses to take a breath. Take your eyes off the screen and you may miss a fast-paced sequence of snapshots that tells you the future of certain minor characters. Run to the kitchen for a glass of water and you've missed an entire scene.But you won't want to take your eyes off this taut, fast-paced drama. Lola has just been told that her boyfriend Manni, an aspiring drug dealer, has lost 100,000 marks on the subway. She has 20 minutes to get together the money, or Manni will be killed by his new boss. How? Where? From whom? Down the steps, out the door, Lola runs, and runs. After 20 minutes, we've seen an entire film. But wait . . . you don't like the ending? Roll back the clock and we'll do it differently. Still don't like it? Give Tykwer another 20 minutes and he'll do it again.The point, of course, is that our lives are not entirely our own: they are shaped by minor incidents and by actions taken by other people. (Who hasn't said something along the lines of: If she hadn't delayed me at the bank, I would have gotten to the store before it closed. If I hadn't missed the turn-off, I wouldn't have been on that street, and that guy wouldn't have hit my car.) Suppose you could \"rerun the tape\" and do it differently? Tykwer does, and does it brilliantly. Will there be a robbery? Will Lola get the money from her father? Will she get it elsewhere? Will the police come in time? Who will live or die? Time will tell.One newspaper reviewer, after seeing this film, said that Tom Tykwer is the most promising German director since Rainer Fassbinder. While \"The Princess and the Warrior\" does not demonstrate quite the same greatness, in both films Tykwer tackles head on the issues of how marginally-related people, or being in the right place at the right time, can influence one's fate. But \"Run, Lola, Run\" is brilliant. The interspersing of cartoon animations of Lola with film; the snapshot sequences; a pumped up score and a never-dull plot make this one a winner.",

    "review/text": "Manni has lost 100 000 deutschemarks that he owes to a diamond-smuggling gangster he is meeting in 20 minutes. The titular Lola is Manni's girlfriend, whom he calls for help when he realises the money is missing. Lola sets off on a frantic run through the streets of Berlin to try and extract the money from her father, a banker, before Manni gets desperate and holds up a grocery store for the funds. However, such a bare-bones description does not do justice to this hyperkinetic, immensely enjoyable film.Since Lola only has only 20 minutes, and the film is 80 minutes, it's not giving away the plot to say that the race to get the funds happens 3 times - the first 2 end in disaster, so she has to try, try again. I'll leave for you to discover how it turns out the third time. Between these action sequences are surprisingly effective hallucinatory dialogues between Lola and Manni, and you develop a sense of their relationship. This kind of gimmick has been used before (the most recent that I've seen being Groundhog Day), but this is the most enjoyable rendition I've seen. It's unclear if this is the same Lola or an alternate universe. The movie wisely steers clear of such metaphysical questions, and you accept the story's reality (much as you accept the reality of &quot;The Matrix&quot;) because it is self-consistent and the actors are so convincing.It's not perfect - there are too many gimmicks in the title sequence that you almost get annoyed enough to look negatively at the rest of the film. However, there's something beautiful about Lola's run, much like watching an Olympic long-distance race. With bright red hair flapping in the breeze, arms pumping, you can't help but admire the energy she has, even while faintly disbelieving that a smoker could maintain such a pace for 20 minutes. It's good that it is enjoyable, because a good 1/3 of the movie is simply watching her run!The DVD has the typical extras, including an English commentary (by the director and the actress that played Lola) for the Region 1 encoded discs. There are some neat gems in the commenary, explaining things that would be familiar to German moviegoers (the identities of certain actors, for instance) but not to American ones. These are minutae, however, that you don't need to enjoy the film. It's a credit to the filmaker that the film is so universal that it can be enjoyed by any audience.",

    "review/text": "The Film:Positively unique. While I see parallels between Run Lola Run and its 1999 counterpart, Fight Club, the instances are only fleeting and probably have more to do with the fact that I saw the two films shortly after one another than they do with actual similarities. Or perhaps it's how both films have taken a novel idea and let it run its course, flaws and all, producing something that's much stronger when all's said and done.If the stranger who brushed past you this morning had walked an extra couple inches to their left, what kind of an effect do you think it might have had on the rest of your life? If the film is to be trusted, a bit more than you'd think. One woman, mere scenery in any other film, goes from lotto winner to baby stealer to bible pusher after her chance meetings with Lola. And that's where the real strength lies here. More than anything else, Run is a story about everyday lives, and how conceivably miniscule changes can alter an entire lifetime. Despite the imaginative camera angles and Quentin Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie storyline, the real focus of the movie is the interaction with the regular Joe, and the ultimate result of that interaction.Sure, there are some scenes I'd have done differently. But like they say, hindsight is 20 / 20 and everybody's the world's finest director from their couch (or, in this case, from behind their monitors). Some transitions are awkward, but the characters are there in full force, and the possibly-complicated plot is handled to perfection. Add to that the list of risky camera tricks that paid off in spades, and you've got a healthy package. Highly Recommended.9 / 10DVD Extras:Not exactly a stack of bonus features, but those that are present really do pack a punch. First, and most notably, is the option to watch the film in English or original German with English subtitles... which, if you've ever heard the American voice actors, you'll know isn't really that much of an option. Put plainly, the English dub blows. Go for German with the subtitles, and enjoy the original vocal inflections in all their glory.You also get a feature-length commentary from writer / director / producer Tom Tykwer and Lola herself, actress Franka Potente. This one's a real goldmine, if you're into insightful audio commentary, as the two reveal bits and pieces the uneducated eye would have blown past without a second thought. Honestly, the definition of what a DVD commentary track should be.Finally, there are the prerequisite Theatrical Trailers, which are nothing extraordinary, and a music video from the picture's phenomenal soundtrack. Again, nothing special... mostly just Potente mouthing along to the words of one of the few songs with a vocal track, screaming, and looking a bit bizarre without the bright red hair. It's no surprise the single never really shook the charts.Worth the extra bucks to pick up on DVD, without a doubt. Hell, they could've just given it the German dub and I would've been happy, but the audio commentary makes it all that much nicer.7 / 10",

It was a test, for Manni's boss, to see if he could trust him.He took the \"merchandise\" to a buyer from whom he collects 1000,000 marks. Lola was supposed to pick him from the job, but unfortunately her moped was stolen that same day, then she rook a taxi and the driver mixed up the address.So Manni takes the subway, but then some security guys show up, and Manni panics and leaves, with the money still on the train! The security guys keep him from retrieving it. He checks at the next station, but it's gone! Some vagrant guy has it, and disappears into the city.Now Manni has only twenty minutes before his boss shows up, to collect the money! Lola reassures him she'll think of something, but he threatens if she isn't there in 20 minutes, he'll rob the store across from the payphone.So Lola has to think fast, and move fast. Since her moped was stolen, she'll have to run. The first person she thinks of, for help, is her father, a bank manager. But will he help?Manni's life is on the line. His boss is a dangerous man, who once headbutted Manni, for simply keeping a carton of cigarettes!Run Lola Run is full of unexpected twists. Showing three seprate scenarios which Lola seeks alternate ways to save Manni. As she runs into people on the street (sometimes literally) We are given a glimpse into their lives, and shown how a simple second can change it.It's fun movie, i got goosebumps the first time I saw it.The actors are GREAT. Moritz Bleibtreu, is wonderful as Manni, who is QUITE believable in his portrayal as a desperate man.Moritz's mother, Monica Bleibtreu, has a small part as a blind woman, who gives Manni her phone card. And Franka Potenteis FANTASTIC, she seems very likable personally. And as Lola, with her punk hairdo, dyed a brilliant fire-engine red! Her navel blazon with a tribal tattoo, that looks like a sunburst. Her attitude, and her energy! She's amazing.But Run Lola Run is more about some cartailing mercs, and a punk fraulein...It has some deeper meaning. About twists of fate. How a single event can effect someones whole life. It's about true love, destiny and determination.With it's unique directional techniques and adventuresome plot, it's truly unique and very exhilerating! A film I'm, sure you'll have no problem watching over and over again.It' soundtrack (which you must get!) is scored with some excellent techno music (partly composed by Tom Tykwer!) And Franka lends her voice to a couple songs! The beats will get your adrenaline pumping, you'll want to get up and run with Lola.The DVD includes an option to play English audio (for people who are lazy about subtitles) but the voices for this audio track are really pretty funny (in my opinion) Still you may want to play, just for fun. I prefer the original German version with subtitles. It has them in French or English. If you watch it over and over, you may just learn some German (i have)Special features: You can chose a commentary by Franka Potente and TomTykwer, and they'll talk throughout as the film plays, pointing out funny and interesting facts. Like Joachim Krol (who plays the bum) was so believable in his bum outfit people treated him badly, because they thought he was a real bum!It also has a music video for the song \"Believe\". The video features scenes from the film, some NEW scenes of Lola running and also shows some fun sequences of Franka singing! Herbert Knaup (the guy that plays Lola's dad) is also in the video.Written and directed by TOM TYKWER! See it, buy it!",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run is the result of a great experiment in film. Despite little characterization, scattered dialogue and a very basic plot, it fully succeeds in its intentions.The simplistic plot concerns Lola receiving a phone call from her boyfriend Mannie, who has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 deutsch marks or faith the wrath of a crime boss. Lola sets off to find a way to come up with the money before Mannie resorts to robbery. That's it. But the trick of the film lies in the retelling of those 20 minutes in three separate scenarios as Lola is given multiple chances to get things right.But the filmmakers don't need a second chance to get this film right. The pulsating techno soundtrack perfectly connects with the beautiful images of Lola running, trying to beat destiny. There's just something about the urgency in her eyes and the gracefulness with which she runs that won't let you take your eyes away from her. The film also explores how extremely minor events, such as brushing against someone, can have profound impacts on the rest of a person's life.There's really not a whole lot more I can say about Run Lola Run. It's just a very small, short film (an 80 minute running time) that perfectly captures its subject. This one is definitely recommended, even for those that normally may avoid foreign language films. You just can't miss out on it.",

    "review/text": "\"Run Lola Run\" (the English rendering of the German \"Lola Rennt\", of which a mroe literal translation is \"Lola Runs\") was the feature debut of actor Franka Potente (Lola) and director Tom Tykwer. Both deliver command performances.The plot revolves around Lola's attempt to find 10 000 marks for her boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), who risks death at the hands of his gangster boss if he doesn't come up with the money. Lola's response to Manni's frantic phone call in the opening scenes is to run to her father's bank to see if he can help, encountering a series of passers-by along the way.Where \"Lola\" differs from the conventional structure of a film is that there are in fact three separate stories told. Each features the same general premise - outlined above - but the results of Lola's run vary incredibly. This process was the most talked-about feature of the film, and as such does not come as that much of an adjustment to the viewer in 2003.As well as the differing end results of Lola's run, the people she encounters have different stories told about them. Lola runs into (literally in some cases) many different characters, a mother pushing a pram and a man selling his bike being the two most memorable. Each of these characters reacts to Lola's presence and then a series of photos is shown explaining what happens to them afterwards - these results also change (drastically) from story to story.A third feature is the \"red scenes\" in between the main stories. Tykwer deliberately keeps the audience in the dark as to the meaning of these dialogues between Lola and Manni ranging over various philosophical topics - do they happen before or after the story in question? do they happen at all? regardless, they serve to increase the peculiarity of this film.And what a film it is. Potente (who also contributes vocals to the soundtrack) is a highly accomplished actor - more familiar to American audiences as Matt Damon's sidekick in \"The Bourne Identity\" - and is capable of almost every emotion in the book here. Lola's screaming has to be heard to be belived, especially in the opening scenes. Bleibtreu, in what is a relatively small role, proves Potente's equal and it is surely only a matter of time before he too appears in a major Hollywood film. The other actors are somewhat hampered by the pace of the film which doesn't really allow them any much character development - often, whatever development is made in one story needs to be totally discarded in the next. They do, however, acquit themselves adequately.\"Lola\" is, after all is said and done, Tykwer's film. From the opening collection of quotes - including the enigmatic \"Nach dem Spiel ist vor dem Spiel\" (after the game is before the game) - and the ominously ticking clock, it is clear that he is not going to let the audience have a minute to think. Lola's running scenes are shot at strange angles, in split screen and some scenes feaure the same shot repeated three times on the screen at once. All of this is done to a pounding soundtrack of German techno, some of which is composed by Tykwer himself. Tykwer has a wicked sense of humour in places, the toughs driving the car and the sunglasses-wearing nun always provoke laughs. The dialogue between Manni and Lola about Manni's feelings for her is also very well-written, both in the German and the subtitled English.One of the most effective scenes is the opening one, a blurred shot of a crowd of people with a voiceover asking questions like \"where are we coming from?\" and \"where are we going?\", followed by a line from the man who is later revealed to be the bank security guard: \"The ball is round, the game lasts 90 minutes, everything else is mere theory\".In the end, what is \"Lola\" all about? That question is almost impossible to answer. Tykwer certainly has something to say, and the general consensus is that it deals with the random nature of modern life and also with the question of fate versus pre-determinism. One thing is for sure, this film is best viewed with friends and family as you will need someone to discuss the issues raised with. Rgeardless of the philosophical bent of the film, it is an action-packed masterpiece well worth seeing.Is this film for everyone? Probably not. The oddities in the construction will put many off, which is a shame since it is a film which will benefit from the widest possible exposure. This film thus comes heartily recommended for anyone who enjoys a challenging viewing experience and doesn't simply watch movies to be told a story.",

    "review/text": "If you are a fan of sappy, uninspiring Hollywood crap like Titanic or The Wedding Planner or anything starring Freddie Prinze Jr., you shouldn't see Run Lola Run. Or maybe you should see it. Maybe it will straighten some of you morons out. Look, I am not a big fan of indie movies or European films. I don't even really like Europeans. But Lola is a movie that everyone should see. I was hesitant to see it myself at first, but don't worry. It isn't a girl power movie and it's not some sick German sex fetish movie. The film is essentially simple in plot and in message, yet it is nonetheless riviting and thought provoking. It is a pleasant change of pace from the run-of-the-mill American film. By straying from convention, the film is able to explore many different elements of life, most notably time. Time is the real protaganist in the film and is always in the forefront. Time is made more evident by the ostinato German techno-house soundtrack. This is one of the few drawbacks to the movie. I may start liking that techno crap if I watch the movie enough. Then I'll start going to techno clubs and raves and develop an addiction to ecstasy. But back to the movie. I can't say much for the acting since I watched the English dubbed version. But the voice over actors were quite good. Just do yourself a favor. Next time you feel compelled to see the latest Travolta disaster, stop yourself, think of my review, and go watch Run Lola Run.",

    "review/text": "I've frequently found German cinema to be too depressing for my own taste as has my husband. However, this film got rave reviews on my film listserv so I had to give it a chance. I was drawing when I put it on the video player and, five minutes into the film, I had put away my drawing, not to touch it again until the movie was over! That is how much this movie grabbed my eye. The director has quite the artist's eye and takes us through 3 different visual versions of reality for Lola as she runs to try to save her boyfriend's life. We see how very small increments of time can make vital changes to the opportunities and chances one has in life, including whether one will even continue living! There is not a second wasted in the telling of this story and it is told very visually instead of being laden with dialogue. Lola has some very dramatic encounters with her father, a banking executive, in these 3 versions of her running. At the end, you feel very aware of how close you might live to momentary disaster, especially in light of the effects of Lola's runs to the pedestrians and drivers on the streets where she runs. We found ourselves very caught up in the film and wanted our own copy of it as soon as it was over, which we did get.",

The way the images and sounds tell the story is captivating, really making you experience the pressure of the situation that Lola is faced with (and the pressure all of us feel sometimes when faced with the choices of life). The plot, when judged traditionally, is weak. But, two factors make that completely irrelevant. First, this movie details a 20 minute period of the characters' lives. Second, this is a concept film, with the &quot;concept&quot; being &quot;the domino effect.&quot; Run, Lola, Run does a beautiful job of illustating the potential importance of every choice we are presented with.

    "review/text": "\"Run Lola Run\" is a magnificent movie set in modern day Germany. It is easily one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. It is entertaining and thoughtful and constantly keeps you visually engaged.Lola's boyfriend, Manni, has lost 100,000 marks that he was ordered to deliver to his boss (an unforgiving gangster) in 20 minutes. If the money is not recovered and delivered within the time allotted, Manni will suffer a terrible fate. He desperately asks Lola for help in this race against time. She jumps around from one disaster to another desperately trying to help. We see three different scenarios of Lola running to save her boyfriend giving us a play on the chaos effect. Tiny details in Lola's quest for the money ultimately change the result of the situation. As things change so do their fates, momentarily touched by her presence running by. The film is a visual display of Tykwer's collaboration of camera, music, and story creating a display of cinematic emotion.The film illustrates a very different kind of female role that strays from the stereotypical portrayal of women. Lola takes on more of a male role as she desperately tries to be the hero in this situation. Her boyfriend is the one who seems incapable and asks for her help. The gender roles are essentially flipped and the stereotypes disappear from the female gender as we see classic beauty and attitude disappear as Lola runs through Germany. But surprisingly, at the end of the story, the female role is present and given to Lola as we see that Manni did not need her after all. They walk away together with Lola being the dependant female pretending that the chaotic journey never happened.",

Its unique format mixes media styles and throws in a few quirky twists just for kicks. It has all the strangeness and black humor common to Monty Python movies, but with a deadly serious and desperate quality that oddly enough works really well. I am usually pretty good at guessing what will happen next, but this flick threw me a few surprising curves. It is fast paced, so you will want to watch it again just to pick up what you may have missed the first time.",

So I purchased it, hoping that it would at least live up to half the hype. Well, for all it's worth, Lola doesn't lack anything in the style department as promised. The critics weren't kidding when they said it had stunning visuals, a pulse pounding soundtrack, and a pace only a cheetah could catch up with. Unfortunately, it just plays out like an extended MTV music video. The plot starts off interesting and easy enough, but the twist and turns all end in such a predictable and almost rushed way. Almost like the director gave up on the last half of the movie. Sure, I like the whole &quot;cause and effect&quot; feel, but it could've been polished more. To keep it simple, Run Lola Run is a roller coaster ride of a movie with adrenaline pumping speed . Just be forwarned, it's not for everybody.",

The main character in the film, Lola, is forced to make several dramatic and radical feats to help raise thousands of DM's for her less than appealing boyfriend Manni in order to pay off some gangsters. A radical new approach to directing is taken throughout the film, with heavy emphasis on music and an almost surreal style of split screen action between different characters. An incredible use of different cinematography and angle points is also used, ( Not to mention some usage of animated scenes) which are also stunning. Unfortunatly for this film, the approach is not enough. The story is often muddled and confusing, and the characters are very briefly outlined. But you have to look at what the movie was made for. The director obviously intended this to be an experiment, he sacrificed the plot in order to try out some new, radical approach to filmaking. Not for everyone, but give it a try if you want something different.",

It is one of the fastest 81 min. movie I sat through.There are a few movies that will hit you right, and Run Lola Run had me jumping up, dancing, and yelling at the T.V. needless to say that this movie did hit me right...LOL!! I thought the acting, sound ( please view it in German, the english track is off), music ( get the sound track it is incredible), editing, and picture were all good.Because of this film, I have become a fan of Tom Tykwer, and the lovely Franka Potente. Tom Tykwer is a interesting directer. After I seen this movie, I went out and found the only other movie I can get by him called: Winter Sleepers. By far is was nothing like Run Lola Run, but is shows that he can do fast action movies as well as slow moving movies. Winter Sleepers is good for its kind of movie, I really enjoyed it; but not as much as Run Lola Run. I only wish I could see his other movie The Princess and the Warrior, but I guess I have to wait for that on dvd as well. Franka Potente, what a catch! She can act, sing, and speek three to four languages...WOW!! I have been finding movies she has been playing in, and buying them! I cannot wait to get Blow, I believe that is her first English speeking movie. Do I have to say she was Great in Run Lola Run? YES, She was just wonderfull in it. I cannot wait to see it again here soon, however, I just have one complaint about the movie.The only thing I didn't like about the dvd: &quot;why did they copy the movie on both sides of the disk?&quot; May be they did not know how at the time to print both stander, and widescreen on the same side at the time. I just cannot stand having dvd's with both sides printed on it.AnywaysI only wish I watched this movie when it came out, but now that I have. I would very much like other people see this movie, because Run Lola Run is a great movie to see again and again. Please pick up this movie, you'll love it.",

I can honestly say that this film was entertaining and exciting for both the film-maker and the cinema enthusiast inside of me. The film itself is wonderfully designed in both the story and the way the film was shot as well. The Blu-Ray is breathtaking; beautifully designed and mastered.Plot DesignI hate it when plots are revealed to me, so I'll try not to spoil anything here.The plot was an interesting look on the decisions that people make every day and how those impact others that they encounter. The director used interesting twists and seemingly unrelated concepts to advance the plot, which was nice since he allowed viewers to develop their own concepts and theories about what is actually happening.Film DesignThe cinematography and montage design of the film was excellent. The techniques that they used with soviet constructivist design and intensified continuity heightened the sense of urgency that the film was getting across for most of the film. The shots were beautifully designed, taking some long shots with amazing colors that pop right off of the screen on the Blu-Ray.Blu-Ray NotesThe menu in the Blu-Ray is functional and themed appropiately with the film. The special features aren't really aything to shake a stick at, but it's nice that they were included nonetheless. The English version of the film with the re-dubbing is not very good at all, as is true for most dubbed films. If you're seriously going to watch the film, I would suggest the German audio with the English subtitles. Also good to note that the Blu-Ray has a great commentary with Franka and the director.",

After watching it I felt like I needed to do everything as quickly as possible.

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run was most definitely the alternative hit movie of 1999. While many movies were excellent in the past year, this stood head and shoulders above most of them. A little, comparatively low budget film, its director Tom Tykwer (with his meaningful, if not literal, film debut) and strangely intriguing star (Franke Potente) draw you into a world of possibilties, 3 possible possibilities to be exact.While Lola (Potente) spends three 20 minute sections of the movie running, frenetically rushing about to save her boyfriend Manni's (Moritz Bleibtreu) life, the movie shifts from tripped out cuts to animated interludes all to a pulsating techno soundtrack. The viewer is taken along with Lola to experience her choices, even the most subtle, and how they affect not only the outcome but also the world around her. Woven into it, however, are Lola and Manni's life together and throughout the film, bits of their psyches can be pieced together to discover their very realistic relationship. The way Tykwer incorporated character development into three 20 minute hyper-paced acts is brilliant.Run Lola Run is definitely a star film of 1999. It deserves to be seen on the big screen, but the DVD or VHS widescreen would be acceptable substitutes, as certain things are lost to the pan &amp; scan cropping. Make sure to steer clear of the dubbed version; even those of you who hate subtitles will thank yourselves.",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run isn't well served on a small TV screen and its energy is diminished when experienced at home, but this is a truly excellent DVD edition.A small criticism is in the chapter-selection screens. Though the division of the film is quite logical, the layout of the pages is quite bad. I also couldn't figure out how to turn off the commentary track after turning it on, forcing me to take out the disc and restart the machine to restore the original audio.But now to the legions of good points. The commentaries by Tom Tykwer and Franka Potente are righteously involving, both director and star eloquent and affectionate about the film. (It's especially amusing to note that they seem reluctant to acknowledge that they are dating.) The technical details Tykwer offers are great for a deeper understand of the execution, and their anecdotes are fun, well phrased, and exciting. Thumbs up to the commentary tracks. There are also biographies on each, subtitle options, and the picture quality is good though, again, if you missed this in the theatres, you didn't quite get the full impact of this movie.Run Lola Run was an enjoyable experience for me at the theatre and, much to my surprise, has grown on me since. Potente's lead performance is Oscar-worthy, emotional at just the right moments and comic and spunky at others. Moritz Bleibtreu is wonderful as the bumbling Manny, and the script is a great innovation. The music-video stylings sometimes detract from the story, but as a whole, it's like a whole new way of seeing the world and, technical innovations aside, the movie is fun, comedically superb, and involving on a human level, a rarity for such a technically oriented film.",

I had heard many good things about it, but kept putting it off. From what I knew of the story,about a girl only having so much time to save her boyfriends life, I was expecting something more like the Johnny Depp film \"The Nick Of Time\". So when I finally got around to it...wow..was I surprised and delighted by this cinematic treat.(and I was mad at myself for not watching it before this!)It's one of those you want to watch again immediately.The film is heart pumping, creative, innovative and fresh. The story will have you thinking about it for quite sometime. Our heroine Lola, finds herself with only 20 minutes to save Manni's life. It seems he has accidentally lost a huge some of money and the men it belongs to are not exactly the forgiving kind. He frantically calls Lola, as she is the one with the ideas.Lola immediately goes into action to try to prevent the horrors of what will happen if Manni doesn't come up with the money. So right from the start we are intrigued to see if she will pull it off.The film doesn't stop here though, it's just beginning. In 20 minutes, many things can happen to alter the course of a life. 'What if's' are the question here. What if that car was just a little slower, or what if a conversation went just a little differently? These are little things that can make big differences when it counts. It's a roller coaster of a ride, as we watch, and cheer for Lola,as she attempts to change the fates.The photography of this film is exceptional. Imagine trying to keep up with a running person all the time, and still coming up with incredible shot after shot. The music is fabulous and very much a part of the story.Franka Potente(Barbara from \"Blow\")is wonderful in her performance of Lola. Directed by Tom Tykwer, this German film is a must see for anyone who loves foreign films or just fine filmmaking.The DVD is presented in German(DD5.1 or Stereo Surround), with English or French subtitles. It may also be viewed in English(also DD5.1 and 2.0) if you prefer. There's a music video and commentary by both the Director and Potente that may be viewed during the film. It may be viewed in either the original theatrical widescreen aspect ratio or a full screen version. I highly recommend the widescreen that takes in all the great photography.Don't miss this exhilarting ride...go for it...Lauriealso recommended:Winter KillsLuzhin Defence (Full Screen Version)Blind Horizon",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run (called Lola Rennt in its native Germany) is the movie that perhaps best defines the dissafectionist undercurrent present in the final decade of the twentieth century. Set in a stark urban landscape, it proceeds at the same frenetic pace as its protagonist - scarlet-coiffured Lola - as she attempts to save her boyfriend's life. Lola's frenzied desperation is echoed in the beat-driven techno-style score, and through the jerky camera work and rapid shot sequences.Instead of 90 continuous minutes of flowing film, Run Lola Run is split into three scenarios, with widely divergent outcomes. Manni has inadvertently left a bag containing a large amount of money destined for a Berlin Mafia syndicate on the train. He rings his girlfriend, Lola, in a panic, telling her that he needs 100,000 marks in 20 minutes or he's as good as dead. Lola hits the ground running and the three segments follow her quest for fast cash.The movie ponders the age-old question of how one seemingly insignificant action can alter the course of destiny; in this case it is Lola's differing interactions with a boy and his dog on the staircase of her apartment block (shown in a cartoon) at the beginning of each scenario that sets the scene for her subsequent varied modes of action. Director Tom Tykwer lets the camera do the talking, and the sometimes overwhelming barrage of verbosity thrown at the viewer in so many modern films is thankfully absent here.Among the many interesting features of the movie is the use of the flash-forward sequence. Minor characters are given depth by the use of a fast-paced photo montage showing what the future holds for them. It is touches like this, which make this film a cinematic masterpiece and a contemporary classic.",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run is a supercharged, ultra-kinetic roller-coaster ride that twists, turns, and boggles the mind with its remarkable profoundness! Lola is a shocking redheaded punk with a memorable scream, and the film all starts out with a really frantic phone call from Lola's boyfriend, Manni. He needs to deliver 100,000 German marks to his mobster boss Ronni in 20 minutes, or he will die a most definite death. From then on, Lola literally races time in three separate scenarios to save Manni's life, so the movie basically ends three times. Although this movie looks all rock-video, MTV-style from the outside, it actually has a profound message behind its unusual exterior. Plus it's got one of the most heart-racing soundtracks I've heard in a long time. This is probably my favorite movie--next to The Matrix, of course!Rated R, but it doesn't deserve to be. It has a few profanities, some violence, and a couple non-explicit discussions about sex. But that's it. This movie will appeal most to people between the ages of 12 and 25. It also often looks or sounds too weird for people to be interested in it, or they just scoff at the fact that it's in German with English subtitles. But you have to look beyond that in order to appreciate this movie. If you rated it less than 5 stars, you only looked at the outside, and in the third scenario, you were just too dizzified or disappointed to really see what finally happened. But you can still believe whatever you want.",

    "review/text": "Using the 'Multiple lives' concept, 'Run Lola Run' tells the story of Lola, who has 20 minutes to find the money needed to save his boyfriend's live if he does not pay it. The movie shows 3 alternate realities (or 'runs') which all start with Lola receiving a phone call from Manni (his boyfriend) asking for help, she leaves her house and start running to help him. Each 'run' while following the same path presents different situations according to Lola's timing while running with different results each time.The transfer to BD is simply stunning, featuring video 1080p HD/1:85:1, the colors are vibrant and Lola's hair never looked better, the video quality is such that details not noticeable in the DVD can easily be spotted on Bluray. For example, there is a scene where Lola is laying down on a street, in that scene is quite visible that the color of her hair was achieved by coloring over the film as you can see areas of her hair not colored equally. There are also some scenes that were recorded with a grainy filter (like the scenes at Lola's father's office). The detail and the grain was not that noticeable in the DVD compared to the rest of the film not using that filter.If you have seen this movie before you should know about how great the soundtrack is and how well it fits with the story being told, well, the German Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track included does justice to the incredible soundtrack. Portuguese and Spanish 5.1 are also included, though even with the small annoyance of subtitles, I rather watch the film in its original language.Same as the DVD counterpart, this release does not include many extras but the movie alone and its excellent transfer are very well worth the upgrade.",

    "review/text": "The details of Run Lola Run have been laid out by countless reviews, and since even the unfavorable ones (very few) stillseemed to like the movie I chose to rent it, then buy it, thenbuy the CD soundtrack. For a week I've been stuck in a loop ofwatching the DVD at home, listening to the CD in the car, etc.To make matters worse, I've been promoting the film to all and sundry.Why all this fuss on my part about a movie with a thin story line and short running time? Because as pure entertainmentit works! Like a roller coaster ride that lasts only a short time, the viewing experience stays with you in snippets of music or flashes of video: delightful moments that won't go away but rerun in your mind. Franka Potente is wonderful as Lola, very different from actresses we're used to seeing (overseeing?)in the USA. This is definately not an art film, nor even a thriller,yet seems to embody both characteristics-it's got a different look and direction that's very refreshing. The techno soundtrackis not apart from this movie, but inextricably linked to it, toevery scene, to every nuance, and difficult to get out of your head; listening to the CD brings back the movie in full minds eye detail! So when I head downstairs with a quirky grin on my face and my wife asks me where I'm going, I respond: &quot;to watchLola run&quot; and perfectly understand her small exasperated sigh.",

    "review/text": "That's really the only word for this film. Energy, action, running.I bought the DVD because I had loved it when it first came out on video (foreign films don't usually make it to theaters in my area). I loved it again when I watched it after I bought it. Besides Lola being attractive enough to hold your attention while doing all that running, the story never lets you rest.If you haven't seen it, Lola's (Franka Potente) boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu), has just lost a bag of money meant for his mobster boss (the dope left it on the subway) so he needs 100,000 marks in the next twenty minutes. It is up to Lola to find the money and get it to him. If she doesn't arrive by noon, he is going to rob the nearby grocery store (which supposedly makes 200,000 marks a day, and so would have 100,000 by noon.)She mentally goes through everyone she knows and decides on her father, who works at a bank. Her moped was stolen recently, so that's out. (She doesn't bother to ask anyone to borrow a car, but that's a small gripe.)So she runs.And what a runner she is! (One wonders how much training she did for this film as she seems barely to break a sweat. She simply shines.)The story takes the path that, depending on luck, time, and actions, each decision you make leads to a different result. We are shown three possible outcomes of Lola's trip to her father's bank and her subsequent run to meet Manni. All three hinge on small changes in how she gets down the stairs of her apartment building. Everything from that point on is different in small enough ways to greatly affect the end result. Changes are even evident in how the action affects the people whose paths she crosses (we know because we see successions of snapshots depicting their lives after this incident).All the while, there is this terrific electronic music playing in the background, not so that it's annoying, but enough to add to the feel of speed that the film has. (I also bought the soundtrack and keep it in my CD travel case.)All in all, a superb film and one that I think anyone interested in avant-garde cinema with a high energy level would enjoy.",

I could never really tolerate euro-techno until I rented this DVD. The music was composed by talented director/writer Tom Tywker and performed by his leading lady (on- and off screen) Franka Potente, who is brilliant and charismatic as Lola. The story is simple: Lola has 20 minutes tomake up for the loot lost by his hapless boyfriend Manni or Manni will be killed. There are three alternatives to the story, each detailing how one's actions could have consequences on others who cross their path. Many have compared this to other what-if flicks such as &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;. But this film benefits from not having a terribly self-conscious Gwyneth Paltrow having another bad attempt at a British accent.The movie is fast, euroccentric, and you wouldn't believe that you'd been staring at the screen for 90-minutes. More exciting than a soccer match.",

The film is constantly in motion, as Lola has 20 minutes to get 100,000 DM$ or her boyfriend Manny's life will be in jeopardy. The 81 minute film covers these twenty minutes, and does so in a very interesting way. I became so immersed in the film, that I began to forget the characters were speaking in German. There is also an English dub available, but the German sountrack is superior. The image on the DVD is excellent, and the commentary is also worth a listen. Definitely worth the price of admission.",

Three different runs are shown, each with its own unique impact on the life of Lola and the characters who she encounters in the twenty minutes.

In 20 seconds you see the rest of that persons life elivating the extras into charactorsThe main problem I have with this is the English dubbing while fine for Lola and Manni it doesn't really work too well on some of the minor charactors, for preference watch it in German with English subtitles if you need them (I do need them as my German is lousy)Don't be fooled if you see the same adverts as I did by the way I saw a review claiming the film has three different endings this does not mean that you are getting anything new from the cinema release it mearly means some wideboy in marketing is chancing his arm.Also on the DVD is the video for the song I believe (not my favourite from the soundtrack but still worth a listen), cast profiles and a directors commentry (the commentrys a bit weak but what the hell he made a great movie we'll let him off)",

    "review/text": "This movie explores the variations that affect our day. Most of the time, small changes wouldn't mean much. But, when life is on the line, one small change can have a profound impact on the following decisions, events, and coincidents. This movie is brave enough to show them, taking a page from Rashomon, which shows the same events from 3 different perspectives.However, where this movie lost me was caring for the characters. The boyfriend whose life is on the line is a gangster, a drug dealer. Why would I care if he lives or dies? So he can poison the youth later on?Overall, the DVD is average. There's not many extras, but it is a 2-sided DVD that has both widescreen and full-screen versions (for those of you that like to miss 40% of the movie). This movie may worth a watch, not much more.",

    "review/text": "I read someone else's suggestion that this German film would inspire Hollywood to copy it. It would if it were that original. I have seen this idea done twice already in America. The first was a short film about a man who was unable to avoid repeating the same few moments in his life, for an entire day. The documentary-like film had no stars. The next thing I knew Bill Murray was starring in Ground Hogs Day, an almost complete replication of the short film I had seen earlier. The short film isn't particularly a comedy, the Murray film is.Run Lola Run is not a comedy either. Its a film about a girl who has 20 minutes to save her boyfriend from robbing a store. Manni, Lola's boyfriend, needs 100,000 in 20 minutes to pay his bosses back for money he has left on the subway train. His life will be forfeit if he is unable to pay this money to the men he works for as a courier. Three times Lola runs in order to help her boyfriend. Each time the scenes are largely replicated but there are minor differences in timing. These differences result in major differences in what happens. I'm not going to tell you why the sequence repeats three times or how it comes out.Suffice to say that the film technique here is extreme razzle- dazzle. I don't think there has ever been a German film with this much heavy production and effects. Mostly we see Lola traversing a German city, going from one building to another, across one scenic plaza after another, running at full speed. In each rerunning of 3 very similar scenarios, her encounters with people, places and objects are just slightly off. The minor changes in time make for major differences in what happens.I have to tell you the film was an obvious formula with too few variations, to excite me much. Some might like it. I didn't think it was as much a story as it was a production. I wouldn't recommend it. Its wonderful filmmaking but very poor story-telling.",

The director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothing's really happening plot-wise. Sorry, but the &quot;alternate-scenario&quot; theme just didn't work. At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds. Maybe I missed the point.

    "review/text": "This film is based on a single central idea which isn't particularly original in the first place. It tells a story from the point of view of several possible outcomes which provides an interesting way of telling a story though it is very reiterative.The film takes place in a typical mittel-Europa city - probably German - and concerns itself with a very slight plot in which there are multiple outcomes. I won't bore you with the detail but suffice to say that unless you like to look at the eponymous Lola (believe me she's no oil painting) running around the streets to get to talk to various people (hasn't she heard of the &quot;telephone&quot; or the &quot;taxi&quot;; perhaps the title of the film wouldn't work well &quot;Phone Lola Phone&quot; and &quot;Ride Lola Ride&quot; don't really have the same ring to them, I suppose) you'll get pretty bored with this one - especially as it's telling the same story with a different ending three or four times.As entertainment this is only slighly more interesting than watching paint dry. I'll give it one more star than the absolute minimum due to it's interesting effort to try and tell a story in an innovative manner but beyond that there is very little of value here.Give this one a miss despite what the other fawning 5* reviews here are telling you.",

Besides that I thought the changes were interesting, the way of filming was cool (and the music), and different because I haven't seen one of these different scenario ending type movies since Clue where the killer would change at the end. It got me mad because some people were giving it 1s and it definately doesn't deserve a 1, at least a 2, even if you didn't like it because the I can understand why some don't like it, but it's not a 1. So I would at least rent this before buying because people have different like and dislikes, but you should definately rent it, you'd be surprised at how bad the preview for this movie looked... but after I saw it I liked it.

Each reflects the effects of slight changes, moments of delay, minor deviations, alternate choices and each plays out the effects these have on the future.We see how the future is written and rewritten by a glance, a moments hesitation, and act of chance connection or disconnection. Three stories are told, but we glimpse the infinity of stories that could and are taking place in every moment and the chain of interconnections that mean that each change changes everything.The film style matches the frenetic intensity of the impending deadline. The music and cinematic style create an energy such that the viewer doesn't simply view but experiences the heart pounding exhaustion of the race against time.It is a film that lays before you the immensity of opportunity that exists in every one of our moments, if only we are alive to see them.I found the name of this film scribbled on the back of a piece of paper deep in a jacket pocket.

She can run fast, but it may not be fast enough to save his life. Combining animation, snapshots, vibrant colored film, with video and black and white sequences, Tom Twyker tells an exciting action adventure love story, that marked a new era of German and world cinema. The intensity, the colors, the music, all brought together in an avant-garde style that combines classical storytelling techniques with MTV-era edits, is unique and exhilarating. It's like a music video and video game and fairy tale and art film, all rolled into one. It's likeLast Year at Marienbadon speed, where the intellectual intrigue and excitement is matched by real and visceral thrills.The film opens with a quotation from T.S. Elliot, juxtaposed quickly with another from a famous German soccer coach, suggesting up front the film's aims to transcend the distinction between popular and high-brow entertainment, poetry and sport, art and action. In my mind, the film succeeds tremendously. The acting throughout is strong, but Franka Potente channels Lola with a combination of fierce determination and vulnerability that is fascinating to watch.The opening scene establishes the philosophical dimensions of the story, with a light touch. Images of anonymous humanity, with emphasis on a seemingly random few individuals here and there, are accompanied by a narrator. Human beings ask endless questions, and every answer provokes new questions. In the end they all come down to a single question and a single answer: the ball is round, and the game lasts 90 minutes. If life is a game, there are some basic guidelines: at some point the game ends, and there are basic parameters such as laws of nature that can't be violated. Beyond that: it's all theory. Twyker employs a unique approach to non-linear storytelling, in order to explore what matters and what's in our control in the context of a life where so much is left to chance. To say much more would be to spoil some of the delight of seeing this film for the first time. I've seen it several, and get something new each viewing. It's like the spiral that serves as a primary visual motif throughout the film, the circle that turns back upon itself with a difference each time. Or like the line from Elliot that gets things rolling: the end of our adventures is when we come back to the beginning and see it fresh as if for the very first time. I get that feeling every time I watch this film. Highly recommended.",

    "review/text": "It's amazing what you'll buy when retailers sell DVDs for four bucks. The cool thing is that you can completely trash your expectations. Heck, I couldn't rent it twice at blockbuster for this money. Needless to say, I jumped in with both feet and landed safely into a film I thought was pretty cool. Let's run with Lola!!-DUBBA DUBBA...I had to watch the dubbed version. I started with subtitles but this is a very visual film. The limited dialogue simply sets the stage for the physical action and reinforces the point of the film. So, it was more important to watch the action than hear the actor's actual German voices. Most of the dubs were fair enough accept for Lola's boy friend; \"GODDAM# IT! HE'S GONNA KILL ME!!! WHAAAHAAAAHAAAA!!\". After that scene it got better.-THE POINT OF THE FILMThough not a completely new concept, the film revolves around the idea that one little word, act or decision will dramatically change your fate and the fate of others. This film, though a bit overly deliberate (what, we Germans?) still managed to be unique. I'm not even going to tell you how this is presented because that's half the fun.-A FILM OF FAIR QUALITYI would never call this great film making. However, it's not at all bad either. Like the concept, the execution was fairly deliberate. I thought this made it more fun. The acting was at least adequate, the story was unique enough and it actually had some exciting visual dynamics without going over the top... ...most of the time.-JUDGE NOT LEST YE BE JUDGEDWell the heck with that. This film is full of stupid people. Of course the question is never asked; \"how could they be so stupid to begin with!\" I guess we're expected to roll with the premise as it was set up. That's ok, but it certainly lurked in the back of my mind that these are not particularly good people we're investing our emotions in. That kind of ruined the ending for me. Possibly the dumbest thing about Lola is her unique talent which borders on being a super power; just ridiculous.-INTERESTING ANIMATIONI almost feel like I'm giving too much away by mentioning that there is animation at all. But it's too late; there are animation sequences in this film. They were actually visually exciting and accentuated the entire concept of the film. It was almost like \"Schoolhouse Rock\" meets \"Lizzy Maguire\" meets \"The Simpson's\"; very Euro-groovy. Please; no smart remarks about me even knowing about \"Lizzy Maguire\". I do have a young daughter after all. Anyway, I actually liked these somewhat crude but stylish interludes.-WAS MUSS ICH DENKEN? (What do I think?)I thought it was \"sehr gut\". It is actually a riveting film that has lots of action and only a little violence (mostly running, duh!). If you like unique story telling with good production values and fair acting this might satisfy you. The ending is a bit irksome to me for reasons I don't want to explain here for fear of spoilage. However, it was inevitable considering the type of people we're dealing with. I recommend watching with the dubbing due to the visual nature of the film. I found it helpful anyway. If you can buy it for the same price I did, all the better. So hop on the Lola express; BOOM CHUCKA BOOM CHUCKA BOOM CHUCKA...Actors....3.8 starsVisuals...4.7 starsStory.....5.0 starsAverage...4.5 stars",

    "review/text": "and more advanced ones, too.ACTION: Lola must run across Berlin in 20 minutes to get to her boyfriend, Manni, and save him from being killed by Ronnie, to whom Manni owes 100,000 DM. \"Lola rennt\" literally means, \"Lola runs\". Not, \"Run, Lola, Run.\" Unlike young Forest Gump, no one tells Lola to run. And, unlike Forest Gump, she does not run to save her on skin from bullies. Lola's own gumption tells her to run--which she does in order to save the man she loves, and at considerable risk to herself. RENNT--a verb meaning \"runs\", also translates as \"races\". She races because she is determined that she can do the impossible. Lola--with her orange hair, green pants and blue top--is one spunky-punky girl.DIALOGUE: sparse, but significant and quotable. My university freshman German students love to repeat, \"Die Tasche!\" \"Die Tasche!\"; the simple phrase which Lola and Manni exclaim to each other when they notice that the \"money bag\" is missing. Earlier, in the red-tinted bedroom scene, Lola poses the important question, \"do you love me?\"; and Manni poses the bizzare but pivital question, \"what would you do if I died?\" Lola's race through Berlin proves HER love. LOLA RENNT, continually surprising us with possiblities multiple race-scenarios asks the question \"WHAT IF?\"",

Then out of sheer desperation I turned to my ever growing DVD collection and scanned over every title for a possible name until I landed on this one. It was/is a perfect fit.Even if you don't usually like foreign films I think you should give this one a look.

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run is a little German film that became an international sensation when it was released in 1998. The film stars Franka Potente as neon-red hair colored Lola who is literally running through most of the film as she tries to save her boyfriend's life. Manni is working his way into a criminal organization, yet we can see that he is a genuinely good guy. Manni is supposed to bring 100,000 marks to the dropoff - but Lola is late picking him up. Thus starts a chain of events that ends disastrously, but begins again.Manni leaves the money on a subway. A bum steals the bag. If Manni does not come up with the money in twenty minutes, he will be killed. He phones Lola from a phone booth, sobbing. He wants to rob the store across the way. She says, No, Manni, Wait for me. I am coming and I will think of something. Her father is a bank president, but his relationship with his daughter is not good, and he has problems of his own, as we can see. Family and human relationships are portrayed excellently in this film. The acting is great.In this way, Run Lola Run is disjointed and post-modernist. People who prefer their story given straight up will say this film is weird. My husband did not like the mix of animation, techno music, and backwards/start over time frames.Which version of events is the real one? That is up to the viewer. One thing is for sure - you will be cheering for Lola as she runs.",

    "review/text": "Run Lola Run is a German film made a few years ago that basically took American cinema by storm. Sure, it's not the most well-known foreign film, but it certainly had a TON of buzz in film and pop-culture circles. Granted, the film isn't for everyone. First of all, it IS in German with English subtitles (which seems to turn off some people). Secondly, the film is very post-modern, incorporating techno music and animation, not to mention a crazy sequence of events. So, if experimental film is your forte, buy this movie!The plot involves a heist-gone-wrong and yes, you certainly see A LOT of Lola running. And in actuality, the film is like three short films that are very similar but not exactly the same. The film is an exploration in how changing just one tiny thing in your life can have an effect on the entire grand scheme of things. The Ashton Kutcher film, \"The Butterfly Effect\" explored this same motif, but with far less captivating and enjoyable results.This film works on many levels. It's easy to understand but also has a depth to it that will have you talking about it with your friends for a long time. I watched it in a college film class, but it would also be enjoyable to the general film enthusiast.",

The movie plays out 3 different times, each time with a different ending, but every time with one goal: save her boyfriend's life. The movie plays out almost like a music video, for the better part of the film is Lola running through the streets of Germany with a techno-like soundtrack playing in the background. The movie is not even an hour and a half, (some people say that's a good thing) and it goes quick. And, I will be the first to admit, it's not a deep movie, but it's fun.

He lost the 100,000 marks he was supposed to deliver to him, and has only 20 minutes to come up with the money. Lola sprints off into a manic attempt to save him, and the plot halts.

I rank this movie with Wings of Desire and Das Boot among the top German movies. My version of the movie was subtitled but that was not necessary to tell the story. This is the story of a woman's love and what she will do for her man, to the point of refusing to die herself and refusing to let him die. By force of will, Lola shows us how deep a love can be. The music is not something I would look for on a CD but it was certainly a driving force and fit so well. Also Lola had me exhausted in the first part of the movie with her running but as the movie wore on it became subserviant to the storyline. The repeated scene of Lola and Mannie after what must have been sex ties the movie together and establishes their relationship. The 81 minute length of the movie was perfect, you can get too much of a good thing. I don't know why this movie is &quot;R&quot; rated unless it is for violence, but come on, what little violence there was was not gratuitous. I hate to waste 2 hours watching a bad movie. Lola was filling and satisfying in 81 mins.",

It's a essentially a gritty look at the criminal underworld in Mumbai, with a great cast to keep it believeable.J.D. Chakravarthi's portrayal of the lead character Satya is great, but the standout actor in this film is easily Manoj Bajpai. Bajpai is charismatic as crime boss Bhiku Mhatre, in the best acting performance I've ever seen in Hindi cinema.From what I understand, Director Ram Gopal Varma had initially envisioned this movie without any musical scenes, but had to include them to make sure the film would be distributed. I thought the musical numbers were decent, though I still believe that this would have been a better crime drama without them. Otherwise, Sandeep Chowta's score works great for this dark movie about the seedier side of life in Mumbai.I'm not from India, so I personally can't attest to the authenticity of the film's portrayal of crime and police brutality in Mumbai. I can only say that this was an excellent crime drama with an amazing cast, and one of the best gangster movies ever shot in any language.",

    "review/text": "FLYING DAGGER (1993) came out at a time when \"wire fu\" costume fantasies (in which the actors, hoisted on wires, fly back and forth during their swordplay/kung fu battles) were flooding the Hong Kong market (SWORDSMAN II, BUTTERFLY AND SWORD, KUNG FU CULT MASTER, DRAGON INN, etc.). It wasn't the first comedy in the genre, but it remains, arguably, the funniest of them, easily surpassing HANDSOME SIBLINGS and ROYAL TRAMP I &amp; II. Boasting enough fighting &amp; flying thrills to engage the action crowd, it's a typical HK melange of comedy, romance, fantasy, acrobatics, and swordplay, yet is very well put together and utterly delightful from start to finish.It tells the story of a race by opposing teams of bounty hunters, Big Dagger and Little Dagger, and their female rivals, Big and Little Bewitchment, to track down wanted criminal Nine-Tails Fox and his wife, Flying Cat. Eventually the two teams join forces to bring the criminals to justice, only to find out that the wanted parties were framed by Master Lui who had initially hired Big and Little Dagger to pursue Fox. This all leads to a big battle at the end with seven good guys fighting Master Lui and his two super-powerful henchmen. In the course of it all, the male and female bounty hunters pair off romantically.Hong Kong comedies are often hit-and-miss when it comes to actual laugh content, but this one is full of clever and inventive gags throughout. Some of the best gags involve the disembodied hand of \"Never Die,\" one of the villains the heroes encounter. After being chopped off, the hand lives on and chases the heroes, often grabbing them in spots they don't want grabbed, but eventually it becomes their ally and helps them out of rough spots. Think of ADDAMS FAMILY'S Thing as an action hero and you'll get the idea. And the trick effects are easily as seamless as those of the ADDAMS FAMILY.The good-looking cast is full of top Hong Kong names, most notably Jacky Cheung (A BULLET IN THE HEAD) as Nine-Tails Fox and Maggie Cheung (IRMA VEP, IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE) as Flying Cat. This is easily one of Maggie's best action roles and ranks alongside her work in DRAGON INN. Tony Leung (also in DRAGON INN) and Sharla Cheung Man (ROYAL TRAMP) play the older bounty hunters who pair off, while the exceedingly cute \"little\" partners are played by Gloria Yip and Jimmy Lin, who bring to the film an attractive dose of youthful charm.",

    "review/text": "I would not hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who can overlook ridiculous plotting and laughable situations to concentrate on the main strength of this film, the incredible amount of FUN involved.I've watched this film so many times and every time it just makes me crack up. I mean, where else would you get a film that has shades of \"Evil Dead II\" with its dismembered hand running about attacking people and a decapitated invincible kung-fu master walking around bumping into things after losing his head, next to scenes of laughable comedy such as the character \"Nine Tails Fox\" who, armed with a long fluffy tail connected to his backside, can defeat enemies with his special move known as the \"Fox Farts\". You can guess the rest and believe me silly does not even begin to cover it.The plot follows the exploits of two brothers who are bounty hunters on the trail of a master criminal for a substantial reward. The only problem is that they are not the only ones after the reward. Two female witches make the inept bounty hunters lives a misery before they realise that the only way to catch the villain is to work together. Various bizarre and surreal sub plots twist their way around the main storyline, making the film a little hard to follow in places, with people turning up out of the blue only serving to complicate matters even further. But overall you cannot criticise the scriptwriters for coming up with something totally original and unpredictable.The name \"Flying Dagger\" is appropriate as the over the top wirework has the characters spend more time in the air than they do on the ground. These fight scenes are very well done if you like your fighting hyper kinetic with super speed editing and characters literally flying all over the place with amazing speed. It all makes for a wonderful spectacle. Blood flows freely in a totally over the top comic book fashion so it is hard to take it seriously. The film couldn't be classed as gory as it always seems to be well balanced with the comedy scenes so the film never gets too dark. Serious martial arts film purists may be put off by the light hearted tone of the picture, but if you're after a film that is fast, fun, hugely entertaining and completely surreal, you can't really go wrong with \"Flying Dagger\".",

Yes, all the action was there, but no pregame or between period segements that ESPN had were not there. The post game celebration which I enjoy the most was not there either. It took the feel or atmosphere that the game had. At least I experienced it in person, but its the little things that NCAA On Demand did not include that keep this from getting 5 stars. And to be fair maybe ESPN dosen't let them include more, but it will be the last product produced by NCAA On Demand that I will order. That being said, I am still glad to have the DVD to relive the fantastic third period finish.",

The clothes, the shoes, the backstabbing, the scandal...it's just another day or, entry, on the gossip blog written by the anonymous Gossip Girl.Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite...In season three, our favorite socialites head off to the next big adventure: college. But things aren't as easy as they seem to be. Even though the socialites may be splitting up and heading to different schools, their relationships and betrayals are still as strong as in high school. Blair (Leighton Meester), still hoping to keep her queen bee status, moves into her dorm at NYU, only to find that her roommate is the notorious Georgina (Michelle Trachtenberg), who has plans to make Blair into a social outcast.Meanwhile Serena (Blake Lively) returns from Europe with some new secrets. While preparing to head off to Brown, she and boyfriend Chuck (Ed Westwick) have a tragic falling out and, instead of being blue, Serena decides to get even. Not only do Serena, Blair, and the others have to deal with the betrayal, breakups, social games, and drama, but they have to figure out how to make college fit into their lives.Along with the juicy and much-enjoyed return of Georgina, season three also features guest appearances by Hilary Duff, William Baldwin, Joanna Garica, Laura Harring, Kevin Zegers, and Tyra Banks plus cameos by the Plastiscines, Sonic Youth, Jimmy Fallon, and Lady Gaga.While season three delivered everything that makes this show so deliciously exciting (and, honestly, one of my guilty pleasures), it just wasn't quite as enjoyable as the first two seasons. Though I still found myself wrapped up in the scandalous lives of the teens, something about it seemed a little off. I think that the transition to college didn't do the show well -something about the high school universe seemed to really capture the spirit of Gossip Girl to me, and the college environment doesn't work as well.Another issue is that the show started out incredibly slow. The first 10 or so episodes were just not as compelling as previous seasons and felt a tiny bit repetitive and somewhat rushed. Thankfully, the last disc to disc and a half make up for it, as if the writers and cast finally figured out how to make the college thing work. I hope season four can continue the momentum here, but it's still a little questionable.This five-disc set includes some really fun special features, including music videos of clips of season three set to Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" and Plastiscines's \"Bitch,\" a hilarious gag reel, deleted scenes, \"Gossip Girl Mode\" feature, which allows for a unique interactive viewing experience with episode 16 \"The Empire Strikes Jack,\" and \"A Gossip Girl Fabulous Affair,\" which is all about throwing a party in true Gossip Girl style.Season three is presented in wide screen format with the option of English, French and Spanish subtitles.Though not as good as previous seasons, Gossip Girl: The Complete Third Season is worth watching.You know you love me. xoxo, Gossip Girl.",

It's really ashame this was a great show with amazing potential. Now it's just a bunch of college kids that whine because they don't want to grow up & are stuck in their hs days. Gossip girl needs a major makeover if it's gonna last because this show is going downhill fast!",

    "review/summary": "Horrible season!",
    "review/text": "I have to say that I had high hopes for season 3, but the first 16 episodes were a snooze, and even Chuck and Blair weren't that interesting as a couple, which is probably why couples never last on this show, they dont know how to write people being in a committed relationship so they just wait till they can rip them apart and move on to the next. The stand out episode was The Debarted, for a split second you got to see why this show used to be good. The worst part of the season though were the last six episodes which were depressing, gross, and just overall really really bad. I think it is safe to say Gossip Girl may be past its expiration date. At this point it seems all they are interested in is making sure that every character in the entire cast has slept with each other, and they seem to always be willing to sacrifice character development and plot progression for their stupid OMG moment. I won't spoil it but in the finale to this season they built a whole OMG moment around a moment from the pilot and yet didn't have the guts to bring it up in the finale of why this particular moment was OMG, if it hadn't been for the pilot the moment would have been as shocking as them having Blair try to be Queen of something, so if they were going to go there then they should have went there fully. As for the characters do we even know why any of these people are friends anymore? I mean seriously all they do is sleep with each other and do horrible things to each other. As for my favorite couple on the show and the only reason I watch, let me first say I was actually looking forward to the epic kind of angst usually associated with a Chuck and Blair storyline, but what they gave me was the kind of angst that makes you not even want to root for a couple anymore, who wants these types of things in a couples history? I get that its a TV show and morals are skewed but when it seems that a fictional couple should not be together under any circumstances based on story lines given because you cant see why anything will ever make it right, then it is pretty safe to say you have went too far. The amount of things they put Chuck and Blair through this season was a little too much, and went a little too far in the quest to shock people in my opinion. Chuck and Blair will forever be imbalanced because nothing will ever be as bad as what he did to her in the hotel storyline. As always Leighton Meester and Ed Westwick shine above all the others, but unfortunately even they can't save this show anymore.",

    "review/text": "Let me start out by saying Gossip Girl is one of my favorite shows on television. I find it to be absolutely delightful, a definite guilty pleasure. Seasons 1 and 2 were 10 out of 5 stars, and after the season 2 finale, I was anticipating season 3 to be the best year yet. I mean, Chair finally happened!!But something changed in season 3. Blair was no longer the Queen B, and I feel like she became a slightly weaker character, which really upset me (She was always my favorite). Serena, especially in later episodes, became more of a spoiled brat, then the charming Serena of previous seasons. And Jenny, oh Jenny, please cut your hair and wash your face before you return to the Upper East Side in Season 3. I could hardly stand Jenny whenever she came on screen.However, the show was still very good. We got to see an entirely different side of Chuck Bass, which I loved. He had a wayy sexier haircut and wardrode as well this season. But, he finally grew up. I still loved all of the Chuck and Blair scenes, they were adorable. Nate, too, finally seemed to grow a backbone. And of course, the season was wrought with OMG moments, especially the finale. All in all, it was still a very good season, just not quite as good as the previous ones. I still recommend it of course, and look forward to season 4.",

    "review/summary": "A surprisingly addictive soap opera where kids have gotten out of high school and into real life drama",
    "review/text": "22 Episodes on 5 Discs Widescreen, released August 24, 2010\"When high school ends, real life begins.\"Thank goodness! Having never watched \"Gossip Girl\" before, I was a little leery of it to be honest and am glad I started with this season. The cattiness of high school is ridiculous because it's all drama for no reason other than a mythical hierarchy of status and in this case greatly increased due to the upper class status of these New Yorkers with family money. All but one of the main characters have graduated and are trying to find their place either in college, in business, or in politics. Real life comes with its own problems and responsibilities previously unheard of for the spoiled few and when old tricks don't work anymore, it's time to learn new ones. Playing games has much higher consequences away from the safe realm of high school.Getting ahead of myself as usual. The series of \"Gossip Girl\" follows the Upper East Side elite for scandalous situations and is based on a book series of the same name by Cecily von Ziegesar.. There is a narrator who is an unseen character that puts out a gossip column online to instantly spread the word about juicy gossip to the masses and apparently has everyone's cell number sending out instant texts. That aspect of the show is probably the most unrealistic but the narrator's judgemental tone voiced by Kristen Bell and insults help tie scenes together and include the occasional, \"Uh-oh, Queen B, looks like things are heating up around here!\" in case we didn't catch what just happened...All the characters are either related, have dated, or have been pining away for each other. If two characters haven't gotten together yet, they probably will at some point. As soon as two do get together, it's usually over within two episodes unless it's the dynamic duo of Blair Waldorf and Chuck Bass.Blair used to be the Queen Bee of her high school and believes she should rule college the same way but quickly finds friends can't be bought and value substance over status. Chuck Bass used to be a party playboy and dangerous antihero but finally admitted to Blair before this season started that he loved her making him a monogamous boyfriend. When two big egos get together they clash regularly, but when they stay on the same page, they are a social force to be reckoned with.While her motives are ridiculous, Leighton Meester's performance as Blair Waldorf quickly became my favorite. She is manipulative and shallow but also very funny without realizing it when she tries to hatch schemes and fails, but it's even more amazing when she succeeds. She has an adorable doe-eyed look that makes it very easy to get what she wants and appear very innocent. Even though she has graduated, she still has help to follow her around in the form of Dorota Kishlovsky (Zuzanna Szadkowski) who has been more of a mother to her than her own mother but gets ordered around and treated badly by her from time to time. One of the most telling scenes into Blair's character is when the two are playing chess with Dorota calling out moves and she catches Blair cheating out of the corner of her eye but says nothing.It is easy to see why all the women love Chuck Bass played by Ed Westwick. He isn't much to look at in the beginning, but it's more about a style and personality and especially about the deep, sexy voice. He is not as diabolical as Blair and cares most about surpassing his late father by starting his own empire by buying a hotel and wants to make his fortune before his father's peak age. He has a smart mind for business and wants to do it all himself without Blair's games and connections to be a self-made man which is difficult for her to understand but admirable.Blake Lively plays Serena van der Woodsen, the beautiful blond bombshell of the show that always gets herself into terrible situations. She has this vulnerable damaged goods appeal and has about five or six relationships easily just over the course of this single season. She is Blair's best friend and rival and when presented with a decision always seems to pick the worse choice. It all boils down to Daddy issues as she spends most of the season wondering why her real father does not want to be with her. Blake Lively appeared in the \"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" movies and will be the love interest in the upcoming \"Green Lantern.\"Sound like a soap opera? It pretty much is. Characters have very short story arcs, get together, break up, find love in another's arms. Occasionally larger plots involving family carry over, but the whole series is like musical chairs. When the music stops, you don't want to be standing all alone so you find someone to make you feel less lonely.A few other characters to take note of: Jenny Humphrey played by Taylor Momsen took over as Queen Bee after Blair graduated and it has clearly warped her sense of morality as she throws people she loves under the bus for temporary gains. She tries desperately to find ways to be happy, but always ends up on self-destructive paths much in the way the character Serena was at the start of the series.Her older brother, Dan Humphrey played by Penn Badgley (who will have a prominent role in the upcoming \"Easy A\" with Emma Stone) tries to play the outsider and be unaffected by money but through marriage he is rich and learns to be an insider this season and has a relationship with guest star, Hilary Duff as she plays a movie star co-ed trying to experience normal college life and finally admitting his feelings for long-time best friend, Vanessa Abrams played by Jessica Szohr.I may poke fun of the conventions of the show, but can see why it's such a guilty pleasure. I ended up watching the ENTIRE series over the course of a couple days. Surprisingly addictive with its reliance on the audience having a shallow memory so each time two characters get together, it can feel special and magnanimous. Conflicts revolve around sex, drugs, teenage issues, family drama, and it always all boils down to status at the end.Bonus Features:The entire series comes in a case that is about average DVD case size and contains the discs on those very slim flip holders. The problem is that Disc 5 is held onto the back cover of the DVD case by another very slim holder and while I was able to get it out once to watch the episodes on Disc 5, when I went back to get it out again to watch the extras, the disc CRACKED. So I recommend being VERY careful with the way these discs are crammed together.While I never got to watch the features, I can at least tell you what they include. Gossip Girl Mode is available for Episode 16, The Empire Strikes Jack which claims to be an interactive viewing experience. There is a featurette on throwing a party \"Gossip Girl-style.\" There are music videos for Lady Gaga's guest performance of \"Bad Romance\" and Plastiscines' \"Bitch\" as well as a Gag Reel and Deleted Scenes.\"You know you love me, xoxo, Gossip Girl.\"",

Still, I recommend it to anyone who has followed the series, because the last half of the season left several dangling threads for season 4. And from the promo, season 4 should pick up right where 3 left off, which I think will be better than the gap between 2 and 3.",

It focused way too much on Jenny and Vanessa, two of my least favorite characters on Gossip Girl. Vanessa dated Dan for the majority of the season, and since she's a boring character, there was nothing interesting about their relationship. Even the menage a trois episode wasn't that interesting. Jenny started wearing that ridiculous raccoon makeup and tried to be the new Blair at Constance. I quickly got tired of her antics. Chuck and Blair dated, but as any real GG fan knows, Chuck's pursuit of Blair was way more interesting than Chuck actually being with Blair. The only episode I liked was the finale (\"Last Tango, then Paris\"). Season 2 was by far the best season. The first half of season 4 was excellent. Season 5 was pretty good. Don't get this season.",

    "review/text": "It's pretty much all been said already, but I go with the majority who agreed that the first two seasons were better. Maybe I need to rewatch S1 and S2 again, but it felt like there were far more subplots going on this season and trying to keep up with who was loving and who was fighting got on the nerves. Jenny trying to be Blair just doesn't work - for one, the show has clearly moved past high school with most of its leads in college, so we don't even see her in that h.s. setting for much of the show. Toward the end, she had been dropped into an adult world between the fashion industry and parties, and she looks like a little girl turned creature of the night in a downward spiral.Since I rarely can watch the show during the regular season, I always get caught up when it comes out on DVD. The show did keep me hooked over the long weekend, and as always, it's so beautifully done. All of the crew deserves pats on the back for how amazing all of the parties, cotillions, galas, etc. looked (you even get a Bonus Feature on it).Leighton Meester as Blair (while losing some of her Queen B edge, but the girl does have to grow up sometime) remains my favorite character, as well as Ed Westwick, who had another banner year as Chuck Bass. It's always fun to watch those two at work. They have such wonderful chemistry and really make you believe they are a couple. Serena remains a mess flitting from one guy to the next, only now she's a mess with Daddy issues. I thought Penn Badgeley's Dan grew up quite a bit this year, now if he can only stay away from always being Serena's knight-in-shining-armor. I don't think the parents were as drama-filled in previous seasons, so they also got in on all the drama - so much so that I had to fastforward through them. I watch for the young adults, not the older adults who you would think would know better!All in all, good season, not the best, but still very entertaining!",

    "review/text": "Gossip Girl may be in the genre of teen programming but it's a show that transcends it's genre in every way imaginable. Sure, the plot can certainly get juicy and that's certainly part of the shows fun and charm, but it's in the writing and acting where it really shines. The show is so perfectly cast that sparks fly just as hard and fast as the best HBO, AMC and Showtime have to offer. I know these are big words for a CW show, but if you have seen all three seasons, you know them to be true. Pair the stellar cast with the wit and dramatics of Josh Schwartz's writing and you have the makings for great TV. The highlight of season 3 is the progression of Jenny Humphrey. Taylor Momson turns in such a harrowing and true performance of a teens downward spiral that it's one of the more compelling story lines of the 09-10 TV season. Her arch always rings true and ends on a cathartic note. Gossip Girl can be trashy but only in it's racy content. This show is well written, wonderfully acted, crisply shot, has fashion eye candy galore, and plenty of wit to keep everything going down smoothly. Trust me, Gossip Girl is a lot of fun and a show that is a seriously well made guilty pleasure. Watch it.",

The guys are in college and its exciting =).I loved Chuck n Blair's relationship and sorry if some of u got bored with it but HELLO thats how being in a couple is. But towards the end of the season i realized Chuck needs to really appreciate Blair and give her more respect, chuck will always be chuck and now i think Blair needs a new guy.( chuck sleeping with Jenny was DISGUSTING!)Blair is my fav. and even though she seemed weak at the beggining of the season she learned how to b strong n survive without being queen B.I HATED JENNY such a whore! I'm so glad she is gone n i hope she is gone forever! in season 2 she seemed to have changed but season 3 was just ridiculous she was so damn annoying and immature, wanting to b with the grown ups haaa! really silly girl? no. Nate was too nice with her.Serena n Nate was a MISTAKE, I didn't like that at all, but i rather her tan jenny.Dan n Vanessa =) lovely, they r good together, hope they bring her back on season 4! Dan N Serena again? PLEASE NO, give us something new! Serena changes men like underwear, yeah she likes diversity =S and she swears she is in love every fcking time. Dan will be better off with Vanessa or even alone.Waiting for season 4 i think its going to be good =) AND why do they need to bring Georgina back? =S i hope she will vanish right away every time she is back there's trouble.",

    "review/text": "Gossip Girl - The Complete First Seasonis the perfect example of a great show to watch. It was guy friendly too. After January 2009, when the show was heading in to the second half of theGossip Girl: The Complete Second Season, the storylines were rushed and repetitive and this pattern has continued in to the third season. Aside from the last disc, the entire season is a waste of money but the cover art does look tempting to buy. Let's face it, even Blake Liveley would like to leave the show. Seriously, how many times can Chuck and Blair get back together or a better question would be why s Michelle Tratchenberg returning at the end of every season?",

In it, Homer becomes caring and loving, and becomes the new &quot;Ned Flanders&quot; of the town. This of course really irks Ned. Finally, it includes my favorite episode, &quot;Dude, Where's my Ranch?&quot; where Homer writes a hate-carol to Ned. The carol becomes a huge hit. Despritly wanting to escape it, the family goes to the &quot;Lazy-Eye-Ranch&quot;, where Homer starts a war with the beavers who live at a near by lake, and Lisa falls for a 13-year old boy.In conclusion, this DVD is a must own for any fan of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.",

They already know that we are going to buy the seasons when they come out, but most, if not all, of us want ONLY the seasons. Now I could see these if they had as many episodes as one of the season dvd's but these are usually only a few and barely enough to even wet the appetite of any Simpson fan. If anything, all Fox is doing is Ticking off a lot of people. Personally I don't see why It is taking so long to churn out these season collections. Look at the Twilight Zone collections that just came out. They have already released 5 sets of them and they were released at once. Come on Fox if they can take films that old and get them on DVD that quick SO CAN YOU!!!NOTE TO FOX-HURRY UP WITH THE SEASONS.",

Rather than accusing Fox of being greedy (let's grow up people, they're a for-profit business whose purpose it to make money), I think they actually deserve some credit for realising that there are customers looking for smaller portions to feed our habit and hopefully get some of our favorite episodes. And, hey, if I don't like the episodes they put on a particular set, the wonderful thing is that I have the choice to say, no I'm not going to buy this. Maybe it is the greatest TV show ever, but it is still just a TV show, and a little perspective never hurt anyone (except maybe that Tron-like computer-ish perspective Homer got in that one Treehouse of Horror segment, that is).",

    "review/text": "I sure hope they change the name of the disc, because 'Christmas 2' just doesn't sound interesting.Anyway, once again, this is FOX's attempt to suck more money from Simpsons fans while they're waiting for the box sets to release. Also, only two of the four episodes on the set are Christmas episode. So with that, this set's stars deplete. But, these episodes aren't as bad as the ones picked for \"Simpsons Gone Wild,\" so, I'll cut it some slack and give it two stars. The episodes? Well, break it down:Homer vs. Dignity (Season 12):Kwik Synopsis: In money troubles, once again, Homer becomes Mr. Burns' \"prank monkey\" to get some extra cash.This episode is pretty bad. The plot alone is pretty farfetched and, while Burns provides a few laughs, wasn't that funny. There was a \"sub-plot\" about Smithers acting in a Malibu Stacey-themed musical. THAT would have been great to see more than a one-minute scene of. But instead, we have Homer get raped by a panda. You heard me. A panda has his way with him. I wish I was making this up, but I'm not. I guess this episode was picked because the Thanksgiving Day parade at the end had the Santa float, in which Burns throws fish guts at everyone. But still, \"Marge Be Not Proud\" was an amazing Xmas episode. Why isn't that on this disc?Skinner's Sense of Snow (Season 12)Kwik Synopsis: The kids are snowed in the school right before winter break, and they turn on Skinner.Probably the best episode of the disc. There's a lot of good jokes in this episode, although it takes a hit when Homer comes in. He takes a hunk out of Ned's roof to make a snow plow. The two drive to rescue the kids, but hit an fire hydrant, and the water freezes up instantly, and Homer hallucinates about exotic dancers and... it was all just really weird. But it was still a good Xmas episode. Good work everyone.'Tis the Fifteenth Season (Season 15)Kwik Synopsis: Homer tries to do good this Xmas, and ends up competing with Flanders as the nice guy.A nice Xmas episode. There is a lot of funny stuff in this episode, but it's sort of pointless, as you know Homer will go back to being his lazy selfish self in the next episode.Dude, Where's My Ranch? (Season 14)Kwik Synopsis: The family goes to a dude ranch to escape a song Homer wrote that was playing ad nauseum on the radio. There, Lisa falls in love with a teenager.Atrocious. The first act was alright. But once they got to the ranch, the humor crashlanded. Lisa is in love with someone 5 years older than her, then ends up endangering his sister's life thinking she's his girlfriend. Have we forgotten that she's 8? Out-of-character, much? Yes! And Homer and Bart try to stop some beavers from building a dam, I dunno. Completely unusual and crazy and bad episode. And what exactly does this have to do with Christmas?This will most likely have a featurette, but I don't know what character it'll be on.All and all, you've got two good episode, an OK episode, and a bad episode. So altogether, you have an average set of episodes, roughly a 2 1/2 stars. But you can't do halves, but it wouldn't matter, because it loses it with the complete pointlessness of this set's production. Only for an completist Simpsons fan.",

    "review/text": "The Simpsons--Christmas 2 has four Christmastime episodes despite the fact that not all of these four episodes focuses on Christmas. However, the episodes are well thought out and funny with the exception of \"Dude, Where's My Ranch\" which has cute moments in the latter (and longer) part of the episode only after the real laughs are over. The quality of the print is very good and the sound is fine, too. The plots move along very well and they will entertain fans of The Simpsons as well as newcomers. You don't need to know too much background information about the characters to enjoy these four episodes; and that's a definite plus. The characters are nicely developed in an incredibly short period of time for the maximum amount of humor and action.Here is an outline of the four episodes; and no, I won't spoil it for you!\"Homer vs. Dignity:\" The Simpsons become financially destitute--to the point where a financial counselor tells them they may have to declare bankruptcy--several times. Desperate to raise much needed cash (he even sold the back seat of the car for money), Homer takes advantage of Smithers' vacation time to do increasingly humiliating acts for the money he and his family have to have. How far will Homer go to satisfy Mr. Burns? Will Homer ever draw the line or does something else happen that makes Homer's stunts for Mr. Burns go bad? And, how does this story line tie into Christmas? Watch and find out!\"Skinner's Sense of Snow:\" Watch for a hilarious spoof of Cirque de Soleil when it comes to Springfield! It's not soon after that an incredible blizzard snows the kids into Springfield Elementary. How do Skinner and the kids get along--or will there be a tug-of-war between them? Homer and Ned Flanders set out to rescue the kids, but their car is stuck in the snow and ice so it looks hopeless. What happens to Nibbles the hamster? This episode has practically nothing to do with Christmas except for the very end where Lisa wishes the audience a Merry Christmas--what gives? It's good; but not tied into the holiday theme here.\"Dude, Where's My Ranch:\" When The Simpsons go Christmas caroling, things don't exactly go as planned. However, Homer writes a new Christmas carol--and it gets noticed! However, what happens when the song gets produced? The answer may surprise you. When the family later on goes to a dude ranch, Lisa falls in love with young Luke Stetson. Will he return her love? What happens when Lisa overhears the boy talking on the phone with Clara--could there be a rival for the boy's affections? The laughs come mostly before Homer and his family gets to the ranch and it's not a bad episode; but it's also not much of a Christmas episode. Sigh. Watch and find out!\"`Tis the Fifteenth Season:\" We see The Simpsons hanging out their holiday lights; and then the holiday season gets underway for real when Mr. Burns' nuclear power plant has \"secret Santa.\" Homer gets a bad reputation fast for being selfish and spending his $500 bonus on a fancy present for himself--but what happens when he watches \"Mr. McGrew's Christmas Carol?\" Homer gets remarkably generous and kind--will he be able to keep it up? Will Flanders be pushed out of the spotlight and what might happen if Flanders IS outdone by Homer? There's plenty more action to this one; so watch and find out!There's also a bonus feature complete with storyboards from \"`Tis The Fifteenth Season.\" It's good for people who want to have a taste test of how these animated episodes are produced.Overall, The Simpsons--Christmas 2 is very good; but I can't give it five stars because these four episodes don't always tie very well into the Christmas holiday. While I still recommend this for newcomers to The Simpsons and Simpsons fans who don't already have these episodes, please remember that not all of this material is as holiday oriented as the title would have you believe.",

Beautiful production design, and a feeling, as with `McCabe and Mrs. Miller', of both tremendous reality, of `being there', while still feeling Brechtian and ironic at the same time. There are moments where the radio music in the background -- used in place of score - is a bit on the nose, and a few moments feel forced or slow. But this is a unique, odd and special movie, examining thieves in the depression without any hint of glamorization on one hand, or forced empathy on the other, while still breaking our hearts.",

    "review/text": "Director Robert Altman accepted a tough challenge in deciding to do a remake of a film noir classic from 1949. \"They Live by Night\" starred Farley Granger and Cathy O'Donnell and was directed by Nicholas Ray, who guided James Dean to his biggest triumph in \"Rebel Without a Cause.\"Just twenty-five years after Ray's brilliant triumph Altman scored big with his sequel, which he called \"Thieves Like Us,\" which was the name of the Edward Anderson Depression novel from which the films were adapted. While the earlier drama emphasized the wide open spaces of Oklahoma and the dark, moody noir photography in which Nicholas Ray specialized, Altman put his own stamp on the sequel, moving the action from the aforementioned Southwestern state to the Southeast and rural Mississippi.Whereas Ray emphasized mood and photography to a greater extent, Altman focused on the social climate of the Depression days in Mississippi. Keith Carradine, the sympathetic figure of the film's bank robbers, as was Farley Granger in the original, tells Shelley Duval, the slender young woman who falls in love with him, that yes, he had killed a man earlier and was sent to prison for doing so, but explains the circumstances.\"He had a gun and it was either him or me,\" Carradine explains. The statement summarizes the dire circumstances of the Depression in backwoods Mississippi, where survival was the paramount factor. Carradine, who played on the prison baseball team, is saddened that he will never have a chance to test his talents in the professional market. Duval holds out hope that perhaps he can, but he knows better. Carradine realizes he is a pawn of fate, having broken out with two seasoned professional criminals, opposites played by John Shuck and Bert Remsen. Shuck complains about his existence and takes to drinking heavily while Remsen, the oldest of the group at 44, is from New Jersey and lets it be known that he regrets having moved into a life of crime. \"I should have been a lawyer and run for political office,\" he laments at one point.Remsen's game plan is to engineer enough bank holdups to create a big enough grub stake to enable the team to split up and lead prosperous existences far removed from criminal enterprises. Carradine continue worrying about Shuck as the weak link due to his chronic drinking and complaining.Eventually, as in the earlier version of the film, the young couple eventually must function on its own. Shelley Duval hopes that she and Carradine can forge a new life but the fatalistic young man who would have preferred playing professional baseball is a fatalist during a Depression filled with fatalists.One clever element that Altman provides is using radio broadcasts of the period to bring the movie into sociological perspective. We hear the reassuring words of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt seeking to bring the nation out of its economic doldrums along with the considerably harsher words of fiery radical Catholic priest Father Coughlin. In one scene Carradine and Duval engage in tender lovemaking during a radio rendition of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, a sensitive artistic touch.Altman collaborated on the script with noted novelist and screenwriter Calder Willingham and one of the director's regular collaborators, Joan Tewksbury. The script never loses sight of Depression struggles and the solitariness of pawn of fate Carradine and his loyal partner Duval.",

    "review/text": "You can pick this video up, new, for about two bucks. Its like getting a novel for a dime and thats fitting since this is a film set during a time when novels were a dime (and cokes a nickle). This film will make you feel like you are in another time and in another place. I suppose that price tag is proof that this film doesn't get much respect but that lack of respect, that underdog independence that marks so many of Altman's films, is just part of their appeal. I can see why this film is kind of a lost classic, because THIEVES LIKE US takes place in a time and place that you don't want to be in. In the rural Mississippi of the 1930's people don't have many options, everyone's just scraping by. The only glimpse of glamour in this world is provided by the radio. The radio is simultaneously the thing that describes the world and also transforms the world it describes by making everything ordinary seem sensational and larger-than-life. It almost seems that since nothing ever happens in this backwards Mississippi world crime like radio is just a way of relieving the tedium. Many of the radio programs involve dynamic capers and crime stoppers and when the three thieves read about themselves in the newspapers its almost like they have transcended their mundane surroundings and have become part of that glamourous radio world. Of course we can see that they haven't. And of course the Shadow knows it too.The three thieves are just ordinary guys (no Clyde Barrow among them). In fact they are each almost painfully plain and they all seem to know it and this is part of their rebellion against not just authority but against life itself. Bowie (played by Altman staple Keith Carradine)is the only one of the three who has any imagination; but his imagination is awash in youth and vague dreams of romance and of playing pro baseball. He was convicted of killing a man when only in his teens but its like nothing ever seems to bring this dreamy kid with his head in the clouds to earth. After he escapes from prison he gets separated from the other two and spends the night beneath a bridge cuddled up with a dog. Its his boyish ordinariness and innocence (despite what hes done) that gains and keeps our attention. When he meets Keechy he seems oblivious to the fact that she is the very embodiment of depression era squalor, all he sees is romance. And its to the sound of radio programs that these two consummate their union. With the equally hopeless and equally dreamy Keechy its like he's finally encountered someone who allows him, even encourages him, to dream. But we know there is too great a distance between the dream and the reality and that the two will eventually prove to be incommensurate.This is a movie about a younger America (c. 1930's) but its an America that feels old before its time. Its a depression era crime story that takes place around drug stores and gas stations and musty hotel rooms. Its about an America without hope. The radio programming is a constant reminder of the contrast between \"America\" the self-aggrandizing propaganda machine and \"America\" the fallen, corrupted, and squalid realm of broken dreams. The whole film--from prison escape to final showdown with the law-- feels muddy. The divide between what we hear on the radio and what we see with our eyes puts a constant strain on us. We know that the thieves must perceive it as well and this is why we end up rooting for them; we want something in reality to equal the fiction.THIEVES LIKE US provides a strange contrast with THE LONG GOODBYE which is about another 1930's archetype (detective Phillip Marlowe) adrift in an always sunny 1970's California. I think the 1930's attract Altman because they mark the end of that organic America, the America that existed before the crass commercialization of the American soul was complete. Altman characters (Keith Carradine in Thieves Like Us and Nashville, Elliot Gould in Long Goodbye) are anachronisms; they each are possessed by a kind of nostalgia for a simpler time, and, for a while anyway, they seem to be capable of living in a cocoon world of their own making, but whether they realize it or not they are caught up in the same web of corruption that snares everyone.Between THIEVES LIKE US and THE LONG GOODBYE I would say I prefer the latter but these two films should be viewed together. The one seems to lead to the other and both lead to NASHVILLE.",

    "review/text": "This movie, a better rendition, if you ask me, of the whole \"Bonnie & Cllyde\" type of story, with Shelley Duvall practically owning the movie as Keechie, the quirky love interest of Keith Carradine's Bowie in this film, was made THIRTY-THREE YEARS AGO by the late, legendary Robert Altman. All things seem to come together nicely in this film: the art direction, something which Altman and his proteg&eacute; Alan Rudolph were noted for on generally small budgets; the acting, by Duvall, Carradine, Remsen, Schuck and Fletcher; the cinematography, which is flawless and denouement, which flows like clear water to its final destination.Remsen, Carradine and Schuck play bank robbers in this movie, but Altman takes pains not to portray them as monsters, with the possible exception of Schuck's character. Bowie is parlayed by Carradine as a sensitive, good-humored, \"aw shucks\" type who woos the rail-thin, down-home Keechie all through the movie. Remsen's character, \"T-Dub\", is portrayed as a bit of a randy old man, but essentially good natured. It is only Schuck's character that gets the standard \"criminal [...]\" treatment in the film, as a drunken, abusive and violent type. The upshot of this all is, BOWIE is the one who's a convicted murderer, but in the film, he's as gentle as a lamb with Keechie and the children he comes in contact with, all related to \"T-Dub\" and Louise Fletcher in one way or another.Duvall's Keechie is her best role to date! Nobody can wield a rocking chair like her! Keechie falls for Bowie, (in fact, Carradine's Bowie is an awful lot like his character in \"Trouble in Mind\", a thief who wants to keep his family out of it,) and loses it when the inevitable happens at the end.This was the kind of film Hollywood did beautifully in the 70s...the nostalgia movie that somehow managed to replicate earlier eras like they had somehow rigged up a time machine to transport whole audiences to the period. There isn't one anachronism or historical inaccurancy to speak of, and the radio shows, especially, some so obscure, I'm sure Newton Minnow would have had a hard time placing them, help establish the feel for the era.A fitting tribute to a filmmaker whose later ouvre was a bit wanting. Joan Tewksbury also helped adapt this novel to the screen. Rent or buy...you can't lose.",

The movie's leisurely narrative means a lot of the time we're lying low with the gang (Carradine, John Schuck and Bert Remsen), playing with the kids and watching the dishes get washed. In a great touch, the soundtrack is made up of radio shows from the era, like \"The Shadow.\" \"The pace is different than you'd do (today),\" Altman says in an equally leisurely DVD commentary recorded in the mid-'90s. \"Unless it was a film out of Europe or something.\"Altman recruited cinematographer Jean Boffety, in part because the Frenchman actually was excited about photographing backwoods Mississippi. Altman went in for a lot of \"screendoor\" atmospherics and dewy greens. \"It feels like an old movie,\" the director observed, watching it two decades later. Also, \"These people (onscreen lovers Carradine and Duvall) weren't big stars.\" The story came from the novel by Edward Anderson, which Altman and screenplay collaborator Joan Tewkesbury followed closely.

Bert Remsen is even better as a gimpy banrobber who after every bank job adds five more to his running count. Louise Fletcher is understatement personified as a motel owner who shelters the crew. \"Thieves Like Us\" is definitely a picture worth checking out. Bring on \"Brewster McCloud\".

Either I'd not heard of it at all or it flew so low under the radar I simply forgot it existed. One way or the other I figured I should give it a gander.I liked it enough but I don't think it's quite the lost treasure others seem to think. It's just a middle effort by Altman.Set during the depression, the story follows the exploits of three escaped Mississippi prisoners who form a gang to rob banks. Four of the main actors, Keith Carradine, Shelley Duvall, Tom Skerritt and John Shuck have all appeared in other Altman projects, and all do a fine job here. The problem, as I see it, is there is neither a story ark or character arc here. You merely follow these guys through their moving from place to place as they hold up banks. Yes, the Carradine character meets and finds a liking for the Duvall character which lends a note of sadness at the end of the film, but he doesn't change. He's a likable guy at the beginning of the movie and just as likable at the end.In typical Altman fashion it's acted well, directed well and has a good music score. They get the period details down cold so you get a good feel for time and place. For me the problem was at the script level. I liked these characters with all their quirks and eccentricities, but at the end of things all I could think of was \"so what.\" This isn't a bad film by any means. It's very watchable.

One advantage is that it was made before somebody tried to be politically correct or force some politically correct idea down our throats.As with many of the earlier movies one nicety is that the credits appear before the film so that you can anticipate the actors and the music that you are about to hear.Because now day's people have larger television, screens it is a little easier to see the wires that hold up items that are supposed to be floating. Nevertheless, this does not interfere with the entertainment.One advantage of this DVD and DVDs at this time is the added voice overview, \"Conversations with John Hough\", which gives insight to what they were trying to produce as they made this movie. Listen to the overview and then watch the movie again and you will gain more insight and still not lose any of the entertainment value.Escape to witch Mountain may be superseded by a new version but it will never be duplicated or exceeded for pure entertainment.The Uninvited ~ Ray Milland (1944)Teahouse of the August Moon ~ Eddie Albert [VHS]",

    "review/text": "In 1959, \"The Haunting of Hill House\" by Shirley Jackson was published. Jackson was one of 20th century America's greatest writers, and \"...Hill House\" stands with some of the best of the British ghost stories as one of the finest, most enigmatic and chilling works in this genre.In 1963, Robert Wise, with an obvious nod to the great low-budget horror films of Jacques Tournier(sp?), directed the 1st movie version of this film: \"The Haunting\". The film retained much of the mystery and strangeness of the novel... is this house truly haunted, or is Eleanor out of her tiny little mind? As in the book, this is really left for the viewer to decide. Wise's version of \"The Haunting\" is, in my opinion, still one of the most frightening and unnerving films ever made. The cast (Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Russ Tamblyn and Richard Johnson) were superb, but took second stage to the house itself. As did Tournier, Wise relied (wisely!) on what one DID NOT see to chill.No monsters, ghosts, etc. are ever seen, just a truly haunting atmosphere made real by odd lighting, camera angles and VERY minimalist '60's special effects (my God, that scene with the face in the woodwork STILL gives me nightmares 30+ years after 1st seeing it... really, this bit has my vote as the most chilling scene ever put on film... if you've seen the original film, you know what I mean!!).Enter 1999. Hollywood, in it's infinite wisdom, decides to take a great story and a great film and remake it! Hiring a hack director (Jan de Bont), and an idiotic screenwriter (don't even remember his name), they changed the story and relied wholly on special effects to turn this masterpiece into a freak show. There is none of the suspense or feeling of dread that the book and the original movie held left, just one constant \"shock\" after another, in a storyline that is not only stupid, but doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Utterly pathetic...\"Zero stars\" is not an option, but even so, I would give this film \"one\" anyway because 1) The special effects aren't half bad, and 2) Catherine Zeta-Jones is SO easy on the eyes!!Other than that, a waste of time. Rent or buy the original version, watch it on a dark, stormy night with the lights off, and see what a truly great \"haunted house\" film SHOULD be!",

I feel bad even associating this movie with the horror in the pages of the book. Hollywood has truly torn this movie apart. Although the acting and actors were not bad, and the house used for Hill House is incredible, the story itself is very different, straying a bit to far from the original. Maybe this is why they did not use the original name of the book, because it was so different. Who knows? but I would advise saving your money for a better movie to buy. Keep this flick for a weekend night rent with a friend or loved on, but dont expect to be scared either. Hollywood tried way to hard to make this movie scary that it isnt even chilling, except for a part or two. For a better scare, rent the original &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; or read the book &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; by Shirly Jackson.",

    "review/text": "The Haunting is not for everyone. Basically if you like a castle setting with an abundance of special effects involving statues coming to life, unexplainable creeps and howls throughout the night and a storyline that centers around children, murders and a group of unsuspecting people having to persevere a night of both mental and physical pain and suffering, you'll eat this stuff alive. Me? I have a weakness for these kind of movies. For 1999, they really took the horror genre to unimaginable heights. This movie holds up and looks very impressive.Of course you can't have the good without the bad! This would explain the several less than enthusiastic reviews here on amazon. While I truly don't think it'd be fair to give the movie a 1-star rating, the obvious low point is unquestionably the acting. Some of is borders on horrendous. I won't spoil the ending but come on, Lili Taylor's a fantastic actress (and by the way she's the one who receives the most attention since the story focuses on her character so be prepared for that) but some of her reactions to the dangers and unknowns is really awful and questionable (the ending in particular).Of course what helps the Haunting tremendously are the several big name actors and actresses that star in it. Catherine Zeta Jones (who's once again, hotter than a picnic in Sydney), Liam Neeson who's recently gotten even more popular thanks to his successful Taken series, and Owen Wilson who plays a dorky and out of place guy wrapped up in a haunted house dilemma. Basically all these characters come together for the purpose of research because they have their own personal demons that need straightened out. Yes it's weird they'd come to a haunted house of all places but uh... the storyline should explain why (but maybe not convincingly or clearly, hehe).Overall the Haunting is a pretty cool movie. It does several things amazingly well. Atmosphere, scares, a mysterious story, suspense... but the one problem is easily the lack of interesting acting all around. Anyone that likes this film would probably love Silent Hill (both the movie and video game). I sense a strong similarity between the two films.",

The casting of Liam Neeson-he is completely lost here and gives a really poor performance 3. Catherine Zeta Jones seems like she's wandered into the wrong movie, goofy bisexual storyline.

    "review/text": "I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought that this movie was scary. You know why? Because it is so different from the bloody horror pictures we see today. It is so intriguingly odd that it sends a chill down your back. The acting, scenery and directing are superb. It has some very strange moments that will make you think twice before going to sleep at night. Let's start with the house. The mere fact that someone would build a house that huge and so scary-looking on purpose is strange. It had hundreds of rooms for children, that ended up dead, and even a carosel to entertain them. It reminds you of a haunted fun house. The acting, directing and ornate scenery were superb. All hail to Lili Taylor for her fantastic performance of Nell, the MAIN character. Jan deBont once again fascinates with his creative, odd and frighteningly entertaining revival of this Shirley Jackson classic novel. The story is somewhat different, odd, and freaky. That fact that it is just so strange is what makes it scary. And the scenery is the icing on the cake. While some may think that the magnificent house was overdone, I found it beautiful, haunting, and a lot of fun to search through. So, for those of you who want a good mystery to watch with your kids, buy THE HAUNTING. It is suitable for childrens eyes because of it's Fun House qualities. But it can freak you out. It haunts you as you watch it, but it really is a fun movie. The noises scare you as the ghosts of the children have a little bit of fun with you. You'll love it!",

The music is especially creative as it pulls you into the story further. An outlandish storyline provides an entertaining trip through an old &quot;haunted house&quot;. This movie is mild enough to be viewed by children, as it maintains the amusement park &quot;fun house&quot; type of theme. Taylor delivers a stellar performance while Zeta-Jones could have done better.

I know the original is a classic but as big a fan as I am of classic horror movies, I have never been fond of the original Robert Wise film. I found this remake to be better in so many ways...the characters (while not as interesting as the originals) are a much nicer bunch to be around; the effects are wonderful; the house itself is magnificent and Lili Taylor is terrific. Movie purists will probably hate me for this but I loved the ending which made much more sense to me than the first one. The DVD is exquisite by the way...the sound effects are incredible and never drown out the dialogue. This HAUNTING is a fun-house version of Shirley Jackson's novel - a couple of jolts along the way, scary sounds, things that go bump in the night sort of stuff - no real terror but a fun 2 hours in a haunted house. And Catherine Zeta-Jones looks so good throughout, that alone would be worth the price of the movie!",

    "review/text": "Movie: BOMB DVD Quality: **** DVD Extras: *It's ironic that the DVD of \"The Haunting\" also includes the theatrical trailer for another film titled \"Unfaithful\", because \"The Haunting\" is unfaithful both to its source material and to its makers' stated intentions. Writer David Self supposedly based his screenplay on Shirley Jackson's classic novel, \"The Haunting of Hill House\", but aside from the characters' names and one brief snippet of dialogue mouthed by actress Marian Seldes playing the housekeeper (\"No one will come any closer than that ... in the night ... in the dark\"), there's not even the faintest resemblance between Self's childishly obvious re-plotting and Jackson's adult and oh-so-subtle original. Self's screenplay is loaded with scenes that demand special effects, including statues and paintings coming to life; faces and forms appearing in curtains and under bedsheets; rugs zipping across rooms; doors kicking people; ceilings lowering down upon hapless victims ... and then in the overly scripted \"making of\" documentary, the director, producers, and actors all talk about genuine scares being the product of what you DON'T see, and about the film being filled with \"psychological\" horror! Uh-huh. Okay. Right.The deviation from Jackson's novel and the apparent confusion of the filmmakers would be forgivable if the end result were a success. Unfortunately, the movie is just a big incoherent mess that never jells. It neither frightens nor fascinates, and by the end is merely tiresome and trite. Huge plot holes are left gaping wide open: what became of the two characters in the beginning who leave the house when one is injured? how did they get through the gates and what was the point of Neeson actually not secretly having a key to the gate? how has Eleanor managed to trace her family tree back to the childless Hugh Crane, and with such precision (\"Grandpa, I'm home!\")? The film is an embarrassment, really, and one can only feel especially sorry for Catherine Zeta-Jones when, as hostess of the DVD's behind-the-scenes featurette, she has to try to inform viewers with a straight face that the sets were so frightening that many crew members refused to work on the film after dark ... like anyone would believe that professional crew members were blithering idiots who don't understand the fakery of the movies; or as if that kind of nonsense would be tolerated in the big money world of film production.In all fairness, the DVD does feature excellent technical quality. Both the sound and video transfers are razor sharp and crystal clear. But honestly, why would anyone care? There are too many really good movies (including Robert Wise's superb 1963 original film telling of Jackson's story) worth watching to waste your time with this disappointing fiasco.",

    "review/text": "Joel Seigel's review on the front cover of this DVD box says, &quot;a funhouse of shrieks and screams.&quot; All I can say is that he must have been referring to the house inside the movie and not the actual movie, because this movie neither made me shriek nor scream. It is a bland, boring, and terrible film right from the start.Why does &quot;The Haunting&quot; suffer from &quot;Episode I&quot; Syndrome? Because it does exactly what &quot;Star Wars Episode I&quot; did: overuse special effects and not develop the characters enough. Throughout the movie, viewers are treated to some teriffic special effects (teriffic for its time, at least), but there is virtually no character development. After watching these actors in this movie, it's pretty hard to believe they can actually act. Dialogue sounds forced and overemotional and even unnatural. Plot development is weak at best, and everyone can easily see that the special effects are there to bring the film out of the slump it has fallen into. Does it work? Sometimes, but the effect wears off as soon as the special effects disappear and the bad plot and acting return.Probably the worst part about this movie is that it's considered an adaptation of Shirley Jackson's classic horror story &quot;The House of Haunted Hill&quot;. I haven't seen the classic film entirely, I did see the part involving the spiral staircase. Let me just say that this sequence is done a lot better in &quot;The House of Haunted Hill&quot; than &quot;The Haunting&quot;. And while the sequence does have a purpose in &quot;House&quot;, it has no purpose in &quot;Haunting&quot; other than to showcase the special effect of the staircase falling apart. If this is any indication of how &quot;Haunting&quot; compares to &quot;House&quot;, then &quot;Haunting&quot; is nothing short of blasphemy if it calls itself an adaptation of &quot;House&quot;.To put it bluntly, &quot;The Haunting&quot; is a terrible film. I can only reccommend this movie to students majoring in film making and directing so they can see exactly what not to do when making a movie. To everyone else, watch it only if you're extremely bored and if you can watch free on television. Other than that, it's not even worth thinking about.",

We have the original &quot;The Haunting,&quot; impeccably filmed in 1963 in black and white by the talented director Robert Wise. The stars were Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson and Russ Tamblyn. One cannot help but admit that this version is superior to the remake on a psychological level. Also you can't do better than Ms. Harris or Ms. Bloom. It was a frightening movie and one I remember from my childhood days.Now, on the other hand, here in the 21st Century, we have Jan DeBont's remake of &quot;The Haunting.&quot; Would people have wanted DeBont to do what they did with the remake of &quot;Psycho?&quot; Filmed it exactly? We know how &quot;Psycho&quot; fared, don't we? Anyway, I found the special effects, scenic design, and sound effects mind-boggling and fun. Sure, we see MORE in this film, but is that wrong? If you don't compare the remake to the original, you may have a better time. I was disappointed in Liam Neeson's lifeless performance, and Lili Taylor is no Julie Harris. Owen Wilson was rather annoying in his role, but Catherine Zeta-Jones was the surprise star. Sure, they updated her and made her look like a tart. But what a tasty tart. And along with her incredible beauty, she brings a lot of life and vitality to the spooky surroundings. And weren't Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes a hoot as the creepy caretakers?So, the plot is much different than original, and the ending lacks the psychological/emotional impact of the 1963 version. But I had a good time throughout the movie, and don't think it's fair to compare such different movies. Apples and oranges. But, if you have an open mind a good bowl of popcorn, I think you'll have fun.",

Hill House is an extraordinary mansion with huge halls, gothic statues, and dark paintings.

At first, things seem to go well for Eleanor; she loves the darkly beautiful house and enjoys the company of her eccentric new friends. Her happiness is soon shattered when strange things begin to happen: voices whisper to her at night, unseen forces pound on the doors, and bloody footprints lead down hidden passages. Eleanor soon comes to believe that the house is alive and is calling to her alone, but when she tries to warn the others of the danger,they don't believe her and start to question her sanity. Whether this movie was true enough to the book or not, I don't know. What I do know is that it's awesome and very well-made.

By me saying that the movie made fools of the actors, I mean look at them , Liam neeson, Lili Taylor and Cathrine Zeta Jones , theyre all very talented but all you can do is laugh at them in this movie because the script is terrible and also very over exagerated.Donnot be fooled by this movies name. The occurances of &quot;hauntings&quot; in this movie look like they came out of a disney movie.Now the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has great visual effects, and does make you say wow when you see the house itself.So think of this movie as disneys rendition of Shirly Jacksons book. And if youd like to see what her book is really about rent the original 1963 classic with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom.",

    "review/text": "It takes courage to create comedy these days, particularly when you weren't intending to. What a shame that the talented Liam Neeson's first film that evokes sustained laughter does so because it's so bad, it's funny. Although based upon excellent material, this film slathers on the special effects with such ridiculous excess that the result generates all the intelligent believability of the \"Poltergeist\" films.What the film makers missed here is that the \"Haunting of Hill House\" story is intended to be a study of the effects of believable paranormal phenomena on a set of variously impressionable characters. As such, it requires the creation of scenes which indeed mimic reported paranormal experiences. And since there are just about no known cases of carved cherubs constantly changing facial expressions, or huge cast statues coming to malevolent life (much less someone getting their head knocked off by ghostly actions), the key concept of \"credibility\" is just a bit lacking here, to say the least.In short, if you really want to scare people, it's going to take more than just a \"Ghostbusters gets serious\" approach. The genesis of a convincing ghostly paranormal environment in which to play out the drama requires a concept completely lacking in this film - subtlety. Any ghost story based upon known reported incidents would build on unexplained sounds, unclear anomalous visions, and the human mind interpreting impressions and feelings. In other words, the exact approach followed by Robert Wise in creating the tremendously superior original 1963 film. The new film seemed to try at first to follow that path, but just couldn't keep itself from launching into a crescendo of splashy but totally unconvincing special effects. Toward the end, I'll admit I was looking for the Stay-Puff marshmallow man to get blown up!Do your self a favor and forget this film, unless you like a perverse belly-laugh. Go out and rent or buy the 1963 film, and see how a fine psychological horror film is really made.",

It might, however, hold appeal to non-horror fans looking for a quick, undisturbing thrills (and it seems that that was the crowd this movie was aimed at). For everyone else, either stick with the original or see House on Haunted Hill for a real coaster ride of a haunted house thriller (Which also actually features better CGI effects, a surprise considering it only had 1/4 the budget of The Haunting).",

But it's not, I haven't seen a more pointless and more stupid movie since the awful 'Wing Commander' that came out last year. Not only did this film have no plot or point was soever but had barely any kills and the even the ones that it did have were so stupid that it my best friend and I spent over half of the movie laughing at it. The people are so dumb, for instance a dulcimer's strings are coming loose and this woman puts her face right over it so she obivously gets hit by it. Another part was when that idiot blonde guy from 'Anaconda' screamed near the end &quot;burn the house down!&quot; whenever they were inside of it because they couldn't escape! The only thing that kept me watching this ronchy film were the special effects by Industrial Light and Magic and even a few of the effects were disappointing! All in all, this definately ranks up in my least favorite movie list ranking even higher that 'Jaws 4' which I absolutely hate and yes even 'Life' as hard as it is to believe. I am very disappointed not only in Jan de Bont but Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones, not for their performances in or behind the film but for even considering for a split second to read the script let alone perform in it.

Despite its &quot;G&quot; rating it was a genuinely eerie experience, mainly because it shed the inconsequential and superfluous layers off the novel. Now comes the dreaded remake, with a set so over the top that it makes you ask yourself who in their right mind would have built such a mammoth edifice and why? The plot was changed considerably (read excessively) and the lesbian overtones implied in the Jackson novel are no longer implied, robbing the film of one of its more important facets. The acting is pedestrian, save Lili Taylor who provided her character with some feeling. Liam Neeson seems asleep as the doctor in charge of the experiment in &quot;insomnia.&quot; Catherine Zeta-Jones is gorgeous to look at, but that's about it. Though in Ms. Zeta-Jones defense, I don't think Maggie Smith or Judi Dench could have made much of the character. The line about the Prada Milan boots was laughable and unnecessary. The script is continuously plagued by ineffectual dialogue and asinine comments that have nothing at all to do with the plot; case in point, the Milanese boots. The special effects were excessive and garish, as if Jan De Bont meant for them to be the sole reason behind the film. It's something like, would you like a little plot line to go with your special effects or would that be too distracting?

It's obvious a LOT of money was spent on special effects - it's a crying shame that someone didn't foresee what could have been done on a quarter of the budget with more attention to the unique Jacksonesque touches from the original story. Of all the characters, only Catherine Zeta-Jones (as Theodora) was passable. The set was a humongous waste, the script embarassingly bad. Eleanor valiantly rescues the souls of children from the wrath of Hugh Crain. Oh, boy! For Eleanor's Grandmother's sake, do yourself a favour and read the original Shirley Jackson novel. You will be surprised (and refreshed) to find very little comparison and realise there was no mention of Ms.Vance's Grandmother at all!I don't know what Jan DeBont was thinking when he made this laughable, totally inept hodgepodge. Any ten-year old child can tell you that true creepiness is in what is unseen, i.e. the imagination. The original story was a psychological tale of loneliness and madness: the \"impressive\" special effects were totally unneccesary and completely out-of-context. It seems to me that the producers were trying to capitalise on bringing younger audiences in the theatre in order to bring in profits for their own personal gain. The film is completely uninspired, hokey, unintentially laughable and frankly ineptly phoney in many ways. The ushers should have rescued the patrons straight to the box office to get their money back!!!For a glimpse of what author Shirley Jackson had in mind, watch the 1963 version of THE HAUNTING with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. It's now available on DVD. It's infinitely creepier, more enjoyable, and artistically esteemed - both cinematography-wise and acting-wise.",

    "review/text": "I first rented THE HAUNTING after its release in 1999 and was extremely impressed with the state of the art special effects. It managed to capture the essence of the original movie released in 1963 based on Shirley Jackson's novel, THE HAUNTING ON HILL HOUSE. I recently purchased it and somehow was not impressed as the first time (somewhat like a roller coaster ride, it's always the best the first time around), it seemed somewhat dated and lost in translation but still retained many other fine qualities. Lili Taylor did a believable job as the neurotic, insecure, and hypersensitive Nell but let's face it, no one could ever compare to the superb performance of Julie Harris. As the saying goes \"it was an evil house from the beginning, a house that was born bad\". Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) conducts a number of experiments involving the supernatural by using 3 subjects, Nell (Lili Taylor), Theo (Cathrine Zeta Jones), the condescending, superficial fashion plate who's clairvoyant, and Luke (Owen Wilson), the boy nextdoor who's in it for the ride (a spooky one). Nell is particularly drawn to the house, summoned by the very spirits who inhabit the house. She holds the key which will unlock the mysteries to Hill House, forbidden to the outside world. This adaptation could never compare to the original movie which has more atmosphere. There is something about black and white and low tech movies that captures the essence, the marrow itself. Hill House is alive, breathing, morphing, you can feel its very blood flowing through the walls, the pipes, its very foundation, the uncontrollable evil that thrives on good. So prepare yourself, be scared, you've been warned.",

    "review/text": "Back in the 1960's, Robert Wise made a movie based on a haunted house story written by Shirley Jackson. That original version of &quot;The Haunting&quot; is an excellent film, filled with atmosphere and subtle terrors. It is still considered one of the best haunted house movies ever made.Unfortunately, this late-1990's remake of &quot;The Haunting&quot;, instead of improving on the original, is a disaster. In keeping with many film-makers worst impulses, the makers of this flick have re-written the story to the point that it bears little resemblance to the original. It always amazes me that many movie projects are started based on a literary work, only to be re-written to the point that little resemblance to the original work remains beyond the title. If there is any need to illustrate the wisdom of sticking to the story, the recent success of the first Harry Potter movie and the original &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; should be sufficient. Peter Jackson's &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; movies looks to be another case in point.This remake of &quot;The Haunting&quot;, along with altering the story until it is almost unrecognizable, manages to lose the all of the sublety and atmosphere of the Wise's movie version, as well. Instead, the viewer is bludgeoned by overdone special effects. Character development has been forgotten, too. The only redeeming aspect is the beautiful sets and a decent performance by Lili Taylor in the role of Nell (although there's little of the original Nell left).The 1999 version of &quot;The Haunting&quot; is weak, and it suffers even more in comparison with the outstanding earlier version. If you want a good haunted house movie, get a copy of the Wise version. It's great. Avoid this turkey.",

They obviously spent a lot of money making this movie as beautiful as possible ... too bad they couldn't make it GOOD.Shirley Jackson's novel _The Haunting of Hill House_ is one of my all-time favorites. I re-read it when I heard this movie was coming out, and I was eager to see it. It started well enough. Even though the premise behind the characters being there was changed, and \"that's not what Hill House is supposed to look like!\" I was willing to forgive these slight details, especially since Mrs. Dudley speaks a whole paragraph straight out of the book in her scene. I thought \"they're actually going to do it! They're actually going to do a faithful rendition of the book!\"Nope.When Mrs. Dudley exited screen right, so did any resemblance to the original novel. Hugh Crain's past, and the reason for the haunting (left so maddeningly unexplained in the original) are painfully and meticulously spelled out in an ever-more-stupid story arc that would have made even Barney the Dinosaur snort in derision at its utter childishness. This movie is not smart, it's not scary .. it doesn't even manage to be funny. It comes across as more of an insult, a slap in the face to fans of the original book. The 1963 movie version captured the novel's atmosphere much better. This version doesn't so much trample Shirley Jackson's grave as dump syrup all over it. Utterly horrible.But it has great production values. You needn't feel ashamed of watching it for that. It's a great LOOKING movie, and that's why I was generous enough to give it 2 stars. Definitely worth a rental if you have a few hours to kill and don't feel like thinking.",

Nothing subtle here, there are plenty of cheap scares--like ghostly images or moving statues. As it turns out this house is basically a holding cell for dead children's souls.

    "review/text": "\"The Haunting\" came out back in 1999 and is directed by Jan de Bont (Speed, Twister). The story is set up when Dr David Marrow convinces three insomniacs to spend the night in a mansion. He does so by telling them that he is studying insomnia in an attempt to help individuals such as themselves. What he's really doing though is studying the effects of fear and how different people react in very diverse ways. Sure enough, the group begin to show signs of paranoia and fear. But are they imagining things or is there something far more sinister happening in the house?I thought this version of \"The Haunting\" had a fair few things going for it when I heard about it. Firstly, it's based on a successful 60s film that was really very good. You'd think that with an increased budget ($80 million) and standard in both audio and visual effects, they'd be able to improve on the original. It also has some big names in it with Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson all included. Even the house that the film takes place in is suitably massive and creepy. Surely all these ingredients would add up to an above average fright flick!Well unfortunately, it didn't work out the way it should have. The reasons for this aren't all that easy to define. I mean, the acting is ok (Owen Wilson shouldn't play these roles though, he should stick to comedy), the house itself is perfectly designed and the audio is filled with creepy sounds and disturbing whispers. But even with all this, it's just not frightening in any way. The movie spends the first hour setting things up and your patience will seriously be tested. When things actually do start happening towards the end of the film, it feels contrived and even unintentionally humorous at times. The dialogue is fairly atrocious, the first death scene is ridiculous (will you just move!) and there's nothing subtle about anything that occurs. This is the main difference between the original and the remake. The 1963 version worked on the viewer's nerves through suggestion and believability. It was all about what you couldn't see that was frightening! Instead, the creators of this version decided to show us everything, and considering how fake a lot of the CGI appears, it only lessens the effect rather than improving on it.As you can tell, I'm disappointed in this film. It's not a complete waste of time and I've definitely seen worse. But I can't really recommend it as a must see film. I know it has been said a thousand times already, but \"see the original instead\".",

Herein, is described actual manifestations of spechtral activity, brought to life to be actualized in a past story bent from the 60's, in a classic remake of this wonderful film based upon several visitors to this old house in order to determine whether or not it is haunted. However, in this presentation, modern effects are used to accentuate those scenes which were left to the imagination before - although it is questionable whether or not these were a positive inclusion or a negative. Personally, I would side with the original, in keeping with the perceptions of the originator of the horror genre, as it is ultimately more mystical or \"creepy\", if the various ghostly manifestations were left to the imagination. Still, it must be expressed that the effects created for this film are up to CGI callibre. I would side with the original Myself, in that the scenes are left to be personally experienced for the deeper experience of a haunting. Actually, I believe actual parapsychologists were consulted for the manifestation of the details of ghostly apparitions. And it is well done.Dr. Marrow is assigned to caretake over several participants in an experiment in sleep deprivation, which hold various personality traits which serve to ultimately accentuate the atmosphere. There is a sensitive personality, who has been sheltered all her life while taking care of her mother, who eventually becomes an avatar of the forces in the house; another who is an adventurous sort, a brunette bisexual lovely; & others who fill the other various traits such as the jock {who resembles 'Flash Gordon'}; & the doctor who initially summoned them all forth. Interestingly, two of the entrants dissappeared from the movie completely, never to be seen again.They all eventually discover that the house to be haunted, by a deranged former owner whose spirit has possessed the house so thuroughly that his essence permeates the property completely, to the point where his very essence, or \"soul\" manifests in the very beams, the ceiling, the furniture, & the furnishings thereof, which by & by shows itself in various manners, to the horror of the inhabitants.",

From intricately detailed cherubs and wall patterns to visually fun apparitions, this film has it all. Though much of the ghosts and their work are pretty fake-looking, they do not take away from the film.The real shortfall of this flick is the weak story that tries desparately to keep up with the caliber of actors displaying it. Lili Taylor portrays the central figure of the story, which is fairly stock and rehashed from an older version of this film. Liam Neeson plays the parapsychologist trying to study the aspects of fear in humans. Catherine Zeta-Jones is wonderful as eye-candy queen, Theo, and Owen Wilson phones one in as Luke, the fourth primary character.In short, if you want a scary, suspenseful flick full of horror, look elsewhere.

The film was panned by critics due largely to the fact that it was released at the same time as the god-awful hideously overblown piece of... known as &quot; The Blair Witch Project &quot;. While miscast and weak in the script, &quot; The Haunting &quot; does have worthy points.While &quot; Blair Witch &quot; showed what hype can do for a bad movie, &quot; The Haunting &quot; shows what a good set &amp; and eerie atmosphere can do for a weak script. The Hill House set is stunning. The gothic architecture will blow you away. The place is beautiful and creepy the same. The CGI effects add to the creepiness of the film. Peolple who complain about computer-generated effects need to get over it. It's 2001, not 1963. The horrified faces of the wooden cherubs and the supernatural terror wreaked by Hugh Crane's spirit can send chills down your spine. Watch the film late at night for maximum shivers. If you sit back, relax, and let your imagination draw you into the story, you'll enjoy it. If you're looking to pick apart the storyline and performances, go watch some vanilla foreign film.The actors aren't so bad that it ruins the movie. Liam Neeson gives a mailed-it-in collecting a paycheck performance. Lily Taylor was ok, but isn't an interesting leading-character candidate. Owen Wilson is flat-out awful ( how'd this geek get into movies? ). Catherine Zeta-Jones, while not a great actress, looks stunning throughout. The script is wafer-thin, and you can usually predict the next line. But then again, what films aren't painfully predictable these days? But the plot is well-thoughtout and well-suited to the horror genre.My advice would be to buy the DTS DVD, turn the lights out, watch it as late as possible, and allow yourslef to savor the atmosphere. If you're looking for Oscar-caliber acting, you're in the wrong place. If you're looking for an eerie horror flick that relies on scenery and atmosphere as opposed to grisly slasher-flick multiple murders, &quot; The Haunting &quot; is worth a buy.",

    "review/text": "I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn't even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn't know who she was - she hadn't married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of 'worst' things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It's dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare",

    "review/text": "I must say that I was enchanted by the original 1963 'The Haunting'. It was a simply brilliant movie with subtle undertones, wonderful characters, and a rare 'less is more' mentality to its thrills and chills. But, alas, like with so many old classics, Hollywood feels it has to remake them with big-name actors, over-the-top special effects, etc, etc.This movie replaces all of the spooky charm of the original with in-your-face characters, bad lines... and, for all its grandiose set-peices it is, frankly, boring.Of course, that's not to say 'The Haunting' is the worst movie ever made --far from it-- but simply that it really has no raison-d'etre. The huanted house concept isn't exactly original; but, if this film was at all entertaining, I'd be more than willing to overlook that. Nothing in the horror genre is really all that original anymore, it seems.It is not impossible to enjoy this movie on its own terms. Honestly, if I didn't consider it a blasphomy to the origional version, I probably would have given it 3 stars on its own merits. The cast displays better acting abilities than you're likely to find in most horror movies, but the special effects are the real star of the show here--and they are, at times, pretty awful. The ghost had me in stitches.I don't recommend this movie--I recommend the old version, for it is a really unique, very pleasing entry in the whole horror genre. Watch the remake if you want to, but don't be expecting anything fantastic.",

    "review/text": "This movie has a promising start; I liked the re-working of the scene between Eleanore, her sister, and brother-in-law in the beginning because it was the only scene I hated in the original 1963 version. Actually for about the first hour, it was tolerable. But then the special effects kick in and the movie goes downhill. Furthermore, I can think of two scenes where \"get out of the way, stupid!\" would have applied quite well. I could have done without the effects. I found it particularly confusing that the ghosts of the children were made to resemble the caramelized wood carvings that decorate the mansion. Considering the amount of money spent, the computer effects look cheesy. There was a Disney quality about the ghostly children, sort of like the automations on the \"It's a Small World\" ride at Disney World. It was just plain silly. This movie was eternal. Hugh Crane's ghost reached a comical cartoon level as his face sails toward the viewer--we get a good view of his big bloodshot eyeball. So is this worth seeing? No. See the original 1963 version instead.",

It was done in black and white and was very effective for it's time in moving it's audience. I highly recommend seeing this version also. Now, this new updated version has hit the screen with great effects, great scenery and vivid color for the modern era. Yes, it to stands alone and is very effective for it's time. I don't feel any of the three medias should be compared. They all stand alone on their own and all should be enjoyed. So I highly recommend that if one enjoys chills up one's spine, they should go out and rent or buy all three versions and enjoy one wonderful experience after another.",

My mother left half way through the movie due to boredom and I ended up fast-forwarding through the second half for the same reason. When you start off with a totally unstable \"Eleanor\" (and the actress was way over the top from the get-go) there is nowhere for the performance to go. But Taylor's \"Eleanor\" in this update started off fragile and just gradually broke down.The effects are good throughout and I actually find this version creepier than the original. The set pieces are huge and gorgeous, and the little wooden cherubs throughout Eleanor's bedroom just kind of freak me out. I like the interaction between the actors. Wilson plays his normal cocky character and Zeta-Jones is a little over the top, but fun. The caretakers are a kick. The ending really makes no sense, and plot holes abound, but I just find this a fun movie.Is it a great movie...no. Is it fun every once in a while...yes.",

This had all the feel of an old Scooby Doo cartoon, and I love it for that. It never even really felt like the intent was to scare us. This is just a fun movie. I loved all the characters, least of which (although I liked her somewhat) was Theo. A little too bouncy and bubbly for her age, but she is CZJ, so she is forgiven. A few jump scares and they even managed to formulate a PG-13 decap. The CGI was a bit (a bit???) over the top. But I loved the story. Enough to forgive a little too much CGI and a few cheesey lines.

    "review/text": "OK, I have to say that the original movie made in the early 60s is one of my favorites of all time. With very little in the way of special effect and all the crap now available to Hollywood, it manages to be a truly engaging and frightening film.So I had hopes for at least a reasonably good movie, I mean why re-make a great film if you're not going try to at least make one that is at least half as good?? Especially with the promise of the great talents of Liam Neeson and Lili Taylor, I expected a lot.What I got was crap. CGI assisted crap. Liam Neeson was sort of not there, and Lili Taylor was NOT good. In fact she was really horrible which was quite disappointing. Her work in other films is wonderful, but it may just be that Sci-fi/Fantasy is really REALLY not where she belongs.All around disappointing. Seriously, DO NOT remake great movies if you cannot do any even better job of telling the story! Its a waste and an annoyance!",

    "review/text": "The Film: The HauntingYear Made: 1999Overview: A group of strangers are brought to a spooky house with a promise of money if they are willing to take part in a innocent experiment. All seems innocent enough, until they arrive at Hill House. What they soon realize is there is a reason that nobody stays after dark!The Package: 4 Stars. The holder is nice, with cool eerie shot of Hill House on the cover. When you open the holder, the CD is held nicely inside the case. I found it easy to pop out, but also stays put. There is a nice inlay included inside that has some information about the film and it's great to read about just how large the massive set was in the film. As far as extras, there is a behind the scenes feature as well as 2 trailers included! You get a short teaser trailer as well as the main longer trailer. Cast and filmmakers bios as well as production notes. Overall, a very nice package.Spook Meter: 4 Stars. I have to say that this is without a doubt, in my top list of all-time! favorite films. As I watched this, I found I had so much FUN watching that I never wanted it to end. The size of the house made my jaw drop. My favorite was the carvings of the children's faces near the bed! Super spooky and oh so cool!!! This film has everything that a FUN horror, haunted house film should have. A massive huge house, creepy ghosts, eerie sounds, a plot that is built up at a great pace, super actors and actresses!! What more could I want? Nothing!Gore/Violence Meter: 2 Stars. There is really zero gore in this what so ever. As far as violence, there is only a few parts where anything violent happen and the two parts are pretty tame really. What replaces the large amounts of violence and gore is tons of great sounds and creepy details that pull you right into the what your seeing on the screen.Profanity Meter: 2 Strikes. Very little profanity used, however Gods name is used a few times which was unnecessary, so I bumped up the profanity meter one more star. If not for that, there is no bad language in this at all and it's very enjoyable to watch.Sexual Meter: 1 Strikes. There are no sexual/make out scenes what so ever. There is a hint from a comment in a few parts that lead the viewer to believe that Theo may have a bit of a extra interest in Nell. Theo asks Nell if she is married, or has a boyfriend or.... girlfriend? Overall though, their is nothing offensive that should offend any viewers.Final Thoughts. So, is this film the type that will leave you awake for endless nights afraid? Probably not, yet I found that it has a extra special charm to it, that is not matched by other haunted house films. I have watched this film 3 times so far as of this writing and it just keeps getting more and more fun! I'm actually surprised that more viewers didn't love this as much as me, but I guess we all have our taste in what we like and that's cool. If I had to sum up this whole film in just three words, it would be.. Spooky,spooky FUN!",

It starts out with an unpleasant atmosphere, which of course suits a good horror-movie -but the story is weak, the acting uninspired it seems, and what is Liam Neeson doing in such a part? He's a far too brilliant actor to waste his talent on a movie such as \"The Haunting\".A shame, but on the plus side he is far from ruining the movie. If you are a fan of ghost stories this will probably get your attention, and personally I find it entertaining -but plot is weak. Story uninspired. I'd rent it before buying.Possible spoiler;As mentioned the lowpoint of the movie is one of the final scenes when the walls and roof in one of the bedrooms somehow transforms itself -and attacks the girl in the lead role. That was not scary, but stupid. And also the \"wooden babyfaces\" decorating her bedroom walls that suddenly starts to make expressions. How? And why? Some effects also were not that visually fit.Other than that, no disaster -and worth seeing.",

There seems to be a revolt by the new film makers in Hollywood to cast off the achievement of the great directors by remaking their movies into CGI affected trash. The best CGI can be found in commercials so where is the novelty in that? This film takes unwarranted credit by calling itself &quot;The Haunting&quot; in total disregard of it's 1963 predecessor or Shirley Jackson's Book! A total waste of time and talent for the actors. Nothing has been added to improve the plot. In fact a lot of the script that offered an intelligent perspective into the supernatural is lost. If Hollywood has been completely exhausted of originality then why don't they revive and improve the long list of B films that had good ideas. They failed in credibility because they did not have the budget to rise to their full potential. This is a respectable challenge! Instead they envy and tarnish the value of accomplished classics by making pointless remakes!",

    "review/text": "My main reason for watching this film was that it is a remake of a film I had failed to respond to 40 years ago. The first version of The Haunting seemed to me stilted and just a little silly. However I seemed to be in very much a minority in taking this view, so I gave the new version a try during the dead zone between Christmas and the new year. I found it just about worth watching. The effects are goodish, but we have been there before with Poltergeist, and in the meantime there has been a very similar film about somewhere called Hell House (this one takes place in Hill House) and I experienced a strong sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. The acting is only good average. Lili Taylor as Nell has the most opportunities and she acquits herself quite well. Catherine Zeta-Jones has - how can one put it? - considerable presence but still gives a fairly run-of-the-mill performance, and the film is really a terrible waste of Neeson. Apart from anything else, his American accent goes to pieces when he shouts. Far and away the best thing is the sets. The interiors are fine gothic efforts, but the building itself was what fascinated me most. I was too slow to spot whether it was Harlaxton Manor, which I recall from another film which I have forgotten in every other respect, but it was from the same general area, and if that part of England contains more than one building like this it looks like somewhere worth visiting.3 stars mainly because this is the season of good will.",

Here, however, Jackson's work is not even on display in spirit; instead, this juvenile, special effects laden mess is marred by a juvenile screenplay and lousy performances from good actors.

If only the filmmakers had taken the Robert Wise film version as inspiration; it is by no means faultless but is a masterpiece compared to this dreck.

Only Lili Taylor can hold up her head after this train wreck passed off as cinema; alleged actors Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones (who was obviously preoccupied with planning her fleecing of Mr. Mid-Life Crisis) go through the motions here, nothing more. And Owen Wilson from &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;? Well, he tried, but the script, written by Hollywood's finest, falls flat from scene one.

Jan De Bont forsakes even the most minimal character and atmosphere development for overblown (and all-too-obvious) CGI effects, resulting in a lot of unintentional laughter, (especially the ending, which was funnier than most alledged \"comedies\") but, unfortunately, not enough to make it a really good \"bad\" movie. As we all know, stories involving the supernatural, and especially \"haunted house\" stories, depend entirely on the establishment of MOOD and the gradual building of suspense, neither of which is ever present here. This is especially glaring because the interior sets of the house are spectacular (they alone are responsible for the one star in the rating); a wonderfully phantasmagoric mix of all sorts of architectural periods and styles that form a truly creepy and surreal space to be in. In the hands of a more talented director, the use of these sets alone, combined with creative sound design, could have produced a much scarier movie. Watch the original 1963 version to see what I mean. In the end, the most galling thing about the whole mess is the sheer amount of technical talent wasted; a lot of craftspeople clearly put in a lot of effort to create the film's look and style, only to have their work denigrated by a weak script, poor storytelling and inept, sloppy direction. Rent it if you must (just to see the inside of the house), but if you're not concerned with that, buy or rent the original instead, which is still creepy even after all these years.",

Eleanor reads a newspaper ad for a \"research test subject\". The Hill House Project will study fear. Can it be an ethical study? Eleanor's twenty year old Gremlin arrives with her.

Nell is awakened by thumps on the wall. There is another strange noise and cold air. \"It's over.\" Luke asks if they are ok. Did the plumbing cause the noise? A window opens and the wind enters. Nell does paper work until something scares her. \"Who wrote that?\" Nell arises at night and goes to the library. She reads an old ledger book that records deaths. She combs her long hair. Luke suspects a trick. Nell finds an old picture album, then goes to that fireplace. She finds bones in the ash grate! Who is in the house? \"None of this is real.\" They learn about the test. Dr. Marrow tries to open the ash grate. Nell sees strange shadows. She sees a strange reflection in the mirror. Are those spirits? That staircase is shaky, then collapses. [The stunt double hangs on.]They can't leave the house until the morning. Someone must watch Eleanor. Something happens to Dr. Marrow. Nell sees strange monuments in her room! The door can't be opened at first. Then they can't open the locked gate. Where's Nell? Eleanor tells about her past. [Is it true?] They run away, doors slam closed. \"He's not going to let you go.\" [Huh?] Can they get out by the windows? A pendulum suddenly hits Luke. Ashes blow out of the grate. [The special effects are aided by dim light.] The ghost of Hugh Crain appears to them. Nell tells him where to go. Demons take him there. The spirits of the children float in the air. The caretaker arrives in the morning to unlock the gates. \"Did they find out what they wanted to know?\"This is based on a novel by Shirley Jackson. The credits name the players and the support staff. It seems incredible that a large building would remain vacant for decades. It could be used as a resort hotel, a hospital, or a boarding school, etc. The taxes would require some commercial use. If left unattended it would decay until it had to be torn down. Watching this movie suggests the story is incredible. When the police find two dead bodies the survivors would have to answer a lot of questions (as in \"And Then There Were None\"). Could that house be used for a \"research project\" if such scary things were going on for years?",

    "review/text": "Director: Jan de BontCast: Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson, Bruce Dern, Marian Seldes, Alix Koromzay, Todd Field, Virginia Madsen.Running Time: 113 minutesRated PG-13 for intense horror sequences and some language.Director Jan De Bont, whose oeuvre includes such other empty exercises as \"Twister,\" \"Speed,\" and \"Speed 2,\" has joined the short list of directors who have gotten so caught up with the special effects aspect of filmmaking that they have forgetten that a potent script, captivating acting, and superb cinematography is what truly makes a good picture, no matter the genre. After her mother's death, Eleanor (Lili Taylor) is desperate to get over her feelings of despair. Research Scientist Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) is searching for subjects to participate in a study on sleep disorder, and Eleanor is a perfect candidate. Accepted, she travels to Hill House, the site of an infamous massacre years ago, and meets up with the other subjects of the experiment Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson). After the usual introductions are done, Dr. Marrow briefs everyone about what they are doing and the purpose of the experiment. After an accident nearly ruins the experiment, Dr. Marrow decides to carry on. That night, strange banging noises haunt Eleanor and Theo as they try to sleep. The next day, she begins to see and experience strange events in the house. Trying to convince Theo and Luke that Dr. Marrow isn't interested in sleep deprivation doesn't work, but it brings Eleanor close to a secret that even Dr. Marrow didn't know about and that could bring the house down around them.Taylor stands out in a dull cast of popular professionals--Liam Neeson is wasted here, and looks mildly embarrassed, Owen Wilson is a ridiculously bad actor who apparently knows how to hit his marks and has some sort of flair for comedy, but he drawls and squeaks his annoying lines to the detriment of the story, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is voluptuous and luscious and is a complete nothing here. When stacked (quit giggling!) up against the much more elegant Claire Bloom from the original, she becomes even more of a piece of flavorless eye candy. Jones prances about in one bizarre costume after another and the few hints she gives that she's bisexual and interested in Nell are so pointless and watered down that the edginess of that subplot in the original seems to be even more uneasy and profound than before. Not content with cluttering up the story with CGI effects (virtually all of which are telegraphed by the previews), this version also completely bastardizes the story (i.e., Shirley Jackson's). Instead of a straightforward paranormal investigation, we get a study of fear masquerading as a study of sleep disorders . The investigator's wife, who plays such an important part in the novel as a New Age flake who wants to communicate with the spirits, and in the '63 movie as a total skeptic, is completely absent in this version. The psychological tensions of the original book and film are gutted in favor of too-literal CGI FX for the cast to yell at, plus a cause-and-effect karma that make this more of a remake of \"Poltergeist.\" De Bont succeeds in creating a horror film full of eye-candy and lurring moments, yet fails in executing what should have been a much more interesting, terrifying, and effective haunted house thriller.",

It centers around four main characters, one is the artist, the other is the stuntman, another the woman that ends up going crazy in the end, and finally the one that brought them all there to do an experiment on fear. The movie starts very slow and takes about an hour to finally get into any sort of real fright or visual effects for that matter. It is not exactly scary, because several of the frightening moments are telegraphed, such as having a bed below several spikes on the ceiling, figure that one out! As good as the visual effects were, it would be difficult to watch the movie a second time, because of how telegraphed everything is. The story itself makes no sense to the average viewer, such as the coincidence that the woman going crazy just so happens to be the great grand daughter of the man that built the haunted mansion (Hill House) that they stay at. Rent this movie, and here is a warning, do not watch the TV trailers, because you will know everything that happens before it happens.",

It's not a thriller, or even a serious movie.Do not expect this movie to show you what real ghosts are like. \"Hill House\" may be a magnificent Hollywood set, but it bears little resemblance to actual haunted houses.If you're a fan of the terrifying book this movie is based on (The Haunting of Hill House (Penguin Classics), by Shirley Jackson) or the original movie, the new story line may be a huge disappointment, too.To put it simply, this is a high-budget, slightly cheesy movie that you'll watch for laughs and a few \"good scares\".I loved the sets and I was hopeful when I saw the cast list. However, I just didn't connect with the characters. On the other hand, the special effects were amusing and a few events startled me.There were several moments that I thought, \"No, they aren't really going to do that...,\" and then -- sure enough -- they did. The reverse psychology of it took me by surprise every time.However, the moralizing conclusion of the movie was too cutesy and predictable. It also dragged on far too long, oblivious to several confusing lapses in logic.This movie is probably worth seeing once, for fun, and a second time to savor the gorgeous sets.Cook up some popcorn, turn down the lights, and expect a few shrieks... and shrieks of laughter as you and friends watch this somewhat silly movie.Trivia: The spiral staircase from the original movie makes a cameo appearance in this film. It also gave Liam Neeson a genuine fright, since he is not fond of heights.",

Her portrayal of a sweet, hopeless romantic is very convincing. Everyone else in the cast is along for the ride. Owen Wilson has to be one of the worst actors around. I would cringe everytime he was on screen. The story about the hill house was good, if not a little vague at times. There are many good scenes that are slightly scary, but none of it is terrifying. Even though her acting was solid, where was a scene where Lili Taylor was smelling something that was pretty laughable. The good: special effects, sound effects, story, Lili Taylor (most of the time.) The bad: most of the acting, some horrible dialogue.

    "review/text": "Either way you're having a good time watching this movie. I was more entertained than haunted watching this movie, which is hard to do either way. Two simple facts that know you're making a right choice for this movie. #1: the acting is good, and in this movie, it has highly underrated stars such as Lili Taylor, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. #2: The plot makes sense, and entertains. It may seem like a bad choice at first, but once you watch it a second time, it really kicks in on your entertainment ratings.Nell Vance (Lili Taylor) is a fairly simple woman neglected by her family, after her mother dies. When she has no where to go, she takes a roll in an experiment that Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson) is doing for people with Insomnia, but it pays really good money. Taking a job where all you have to do is don't sleep; sounds pretty simple right? Something seems strange, yet interesting about the location where the experiment is being held, at the Hill House. Though it's strange that someone would abandon such a neat place, weird things seem to go on as the occupants get used to it. Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), and Nell hear rigorous banging sounds in their rooms through the night. Things get cold with an explanation, and out of no where, the Harpsichord tightens a string by itself, and snaps nearly cutting Dr. Marrows assisstants eye. What's even worse is that something is coming after Nell. She can hear voices in her room, but what are they trying to tell her? Maybe she got more of a job then she bargained for.The acting in this movie was great, epecially by Lili Taylor. She was just great. She gives a kind of uneasy feeling about the house the way she potrayed her part as Nell. Catherine Zeta-Jones as Theo too. Her and Owen Wilson as Luke added the comedy to the movie as the two modern gripers. All in all, not the kind of movie you'd expect. Some may not find it scary at all. I didn't really. I found it more of a great thriller. I actually found the trailer more terrifying.Movies such as Ghost Ship and The Haunting are way too actiony to be scary. They do have their scary and haunting moments, but are really more of thrillers and suspensful than anything else. That's what's good about them, though. They come out trying to be something, and end up being something different, and in a lot better way than expected. Like I've been saying, one thing that really saved this movie was the acting. It's very rare any movie these days has any good acting, or else it's all overdone. By the star studded cast, you go in expecting something and get exactly what you desired from the cast. Love that Liam Neeson, and Lili Taylor. They are the best!As for the affects, their better than a good many others in the nineties, and give you the illusion that they're not fake, but just barely. It's the plot that really grabs you, and Highclere Castle as the location was gorgeous. I fell in love with the set itself when it wasn't coming to life. And I must say, as an avid music lover, I can't help but notice the gorgeous music throughout the whole thing. It has it's ups and downs, but in the end, delivers well.",

    "review/text": "This will be referred to as a classic horror in the years ahead....a classic horrible example of how Hollywood money can destroy a really good story-line. The plot, what there is of it, bears no resemblance to Shirley Jackson's psychological horror story. It's scraps of plots which make no sense, and dead-ends. There's lots of CGI and special effects, which no doubt were supposed to make up for the missing story. They don't. Nothing here is scary, unless you find the thought of dusting hilariously ugly wooden cherubs frightening.The sets for the house were the best part, being completely bizarre and unreal and therefore worth seeing. Liam Neeson looks like he was blackmailed into taking the part, and Owen Wilson, with a fixed smirk rather like the afore-mentioned wooden cherubs, acts like he's in a comedy from the get-go. The women, Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones, manage a little better considering the material they're given. Zeta-Jones certainly looks good, colorfully tarty and all that, but isn't given anything to do except wander around looking colorfully tarty. Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes look like they're having fun hamming it up in their roles as the caretakers, but they were probably just happy they had such small parts. This doesn't make it as a \"good\" bad movie, and it wouldn't really worth the trouble hating, except that it butchered a book that was both scary and intelligent.",

    "review/text": "&quot;The Haunting&quot; offers a textbook example of what happens when too much money is thrown at an ill-conceived project in the hopes that it will bear fruit. To terrify an audience, a good director needs no more than the ability to recognize and manipulate the power of the human imagination; the original &quot;Haunting&quot; or &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; come to mind. Jan de Bont, the director of this film, seems to have set out to make an aggressively mediocre movie: nothing, but NOTHING, is left to the imagination here. Every single supposed &quot;fright&quot; in the film is served up naked under a spotlight for us, leaving us with nothing but a collection of bland computer renderings. It was as if the advent of computer technology permitted the filmmakers to reveal all that was so cunningly suggested in the original with no thought as to the consequences. All psychological terror is expunged by the lack of faith in the intelligence of the audience. On the lighter side, the audience with whom I saw &quot;The Haunting&quot; had a grand time -- we recognized this contempt the filmmakers had for us and laughed from beginning to end. I never thought a decapitation by a huge stone lion's head flue could be funny...but films can always surprise you, can't they?",

    "review/text": "This is another one of these stories in which absolutely nothing can compare to the book. Shirley Jackson's \"The Haunting of Hill House\" is the most frightening, penetrating ghost story I've ever read. The only movie that begins to do this story justice is the original black-and-white, \"The Haunting\", starring Julie Harris (1963).The newer version, which I'm reviewing here, starts off fairly well, actually. The sets are rich and nicely detailed. Catherine Zeta Jones makes a really electric, alluring Theo. Liam Neeson plays a workable Dr. Marrow (not \"Dr. Marquay\", as named in the 1963 movie). Owen Wilson plays his usual annoying, irritatingly contemporary persona in an obligatory way as Luke, but I've never been able to take any movie seriously that Wilson's been in, and horror stories must be taken seriously or they're undermined to begin with (he reminds me a lot of Bruce Dern, but at least Dern has a modicum of talent). I don't really remember Lili Taylor as being in much of anything before, and sometimes that works well for a movie, but not this one. The part of Eleanor Vance is that of a very complex, tortured, naive person, and it was played to perfection by Julie Harris (the '63 version), whereas I remember less about the Lili Taylor portrayal of this central character than that of any of the other actors.For all that, the 1st half of this newer version is not bad, but the 2nd half goes downhill rapidly. And in the last 25% of the movie, the director was intent in pulling out every cliched, hackneyed special effects staple used in every movie about ghosts from \"Poltergeist\" to \"Ghost Busters\", complete with all the shape-shifting techniques we enjoyed in \"Terminator II\", and many episodes of \"Deep Space 9\". By the year 1999, these effects just weren't enough to carry a movie anymore, and a special effects-weary audience isn't going to \"drop their popcorn\" over them now. As we all know, good special effects can enhance a movie, but it is rare that it can compensate for a movie that has little else going for it.",

    "review/text": "The beginning was pretty decent, more or less following the story of Shirley Jackson's novel, although the attempt at updating the character's motives for being in the house was ludicrous. Gone from this film was the subtlety of the original. When reading the book or watching the original movie, the audience (or reader) is left wondering whether the story is about a woman going insane or a haunted house claiming a soul. This movie, with admittedly great effects by Phil Tippett, leaves no doubt. There are ghosts in that place, as loud &amp; obvious as the ghosts in the far superior Poltergeist. The house was no longer built with the angles ever so slightly off, but instead merely slapped togather haphazardly. Gone also is the rivalry between the two female leads, and the creepiest part in the book and the original movie is reduced to a single absurd line in this film (&quot;who was holding my hand?&quot;). There is one genuinely scary part of the movie-- when, during some mysterious banging, Lilli Taylor wakes up and addresses her dead mother (who, while ill, would call to Lilli by banging on the wall.) It was the one moment which stuck in the imagination. Jan deBont should stick to movies with big guns, that is if he is ever allowed to make another movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones was great to look at &amp; did a whole lot with very, very little. Liam Neeson had no need to care about his performance; he was in Star Wars: Episode I-The Phantom Menace. Lili Taylor, always impressive in independant movies, still proves herself capable &amp; deserving of better material than this (although considering the literary source, she was well-cast.) Owen Wilson was likewise competent. But unfortuneately, this movie proves that good acting &amp; good special effects can't make up for a shoddy script, and a director who just can't do subtlety.",

Not because it was scary, but because this is what modern filmmaking has amounted to.The original is scary, not just because it works more with suggestion and is in black and white, but because we truly feel that the four people in Hill House truly are there..all alone...in the night...in the dark. And it rewards you in the end with a quick flash of (something!) that makes you jump out of your seat.In this 1999 version, the house is full of eyepopping color, fun house like rooms, and four blithering idiots inside. (If Lili Taylor, whom I usually adore, said one more time that Hugh Crain built this beautiful Hill House for the children to enjoy, I was going to reach into the TV and spook her myself.)The saving grace of the film are the sets. wonderfully elaborate (until the house grows eyes and growls with the ferocity of a Hanna Barbera cartoon.

    "review/text": "I saw this when it first hit movie theaters in 1999 and actually fell asleep halfway! Now, as a horror movie fanatic (and not someone raised on Freddy and Jason--I'm 53), when a movie heralded as \"frightening\" and \"shocking\" knocks me out (literally), I gotta wonder. What was the point of remaking something that's already so perfect? The 1963 version hit all the right notes. It was filmed in black and white, had a truly eerie feel, some spine-numbing frights, and enough ambiance to satisfy anyone interested in the macabre. This \"new\" version is just terrible on every level. Where to start? The cast. I hated--emphasis on that last word, HATED--Lili Taylor as Nell. The reviewers here say she's \"talented,\" but I gotta ask, where ARE they getting such an impression? Certainly not from this movie, because she's downright awful! When Taylor screams (and she does a LOT of that), it sounds like an angry bull in heat, and the sight of her galloping down the hallways bellowing (again and again, it seems) are sure to either make you cringe or break out in gales of laughter. As for the rest of the cast, they're washed out and blah. Owen Wilson does his stoned surfer boy with the crooked nose schtick, Catherine Zeta-Jones is slumming on her way to an Oscar, and Liam Neeson looks so incredibly uncomfortable, like he's about to have dental surgery. The sets are way overdone, and when the CGI kicks in, the whole kit and kaboodle just collapses. What was suggested in the original is realized in the remake and done up BIG. The \"breathing door\" morphs into a frickin' house moving and undulating and actually forming faces and claws and whatever. It's all wacked out nonsense, courtesy of a director with absolutely no style whatsoever.I gotta say, it amazes me that some of you have given this high marks. Either you guys have a low tolerance for horror, or Dreamworks is employing \"plants\" on Amazon to promote this piece of garbage. If you want true haunted house scares, check out the original Haunting, as well as Legend of Hell House, The Changeling, Suspiria, and the original House on Haunted Hill.Oh, and I gave this one star because \"no stars\" isn't an option.",

    "review/text": "One review says that this book had the misfortune of being released in the same year as The Blair Witch Project. That's a misnomer since a successful horror movie usually means more income for the rest of the horror movies in the theaters. A movie that stars Liam Neeson, Owen Wilson, Catherine Zeta Jones and Lily Taylor has no excuse for repelling audiences. No, this movie had the misfortune of Jan De Bont in the director's chair.I normally don't compare movies to books. It's a gut wrenching experience and despite common wisdom, sometimes the movie is just as good and even better than the book (The Godfather is a prime example of the latter). Even if a movie has very little respect for the source material it can still stand on it's own merits (Starship Troopers.) However, this movie has committed a crime so heinous as to warrent the direst condemnation.It shows the ghosts.That might seem like a minor point, but under the guise of \"updating\" the source material Jan De Bont completely ignored what made the source material so compelling in the first place. Shirley Jackson lets the tension build and build because she never intended to resolve it with some easy explanation. By the end of the book, you still don't know if the house is really haunted but it doesn't matter because her protagonist is scary enough (in her own passive aggressive spiteful way). Jan De Bont, seen in the featurette patting himself on the back for \"updating the movie\", turns the house into a Disneyland ride. It's like if someone took Superman and went \"ok this is good but instead of flying and having powers, let's make him not fly or possess super strength and why don't we have him trying to make it as a Broadway star instead of as a superhero\". Maybe Jan De Bont can direct The Catcher in the Rye with a Holden Caulfield that doesn't talk much, but is full of saccharine good wishes when he does talk.This movie had the production values, the actors and the source material. It could have been a classic like the original. Instead it was a mess. Maybe you can blame the budget. After all, with that much money the temptation to make moving eagle statues would be too much, but even with all that money they couldn't erase the taint of De Bont.Read the book. Watch the original. Or watching Kubrick's The Shining (which is truer to the Jackson book than this movie ironically)",

    "review/text": "I have nothing against the girl, but to me anyway, she's a relative unknown, and they succeeded in casting a Plain Jane, certainly against Catherine Zeta Jones' beauty. She was a terrific actress, and the only reason I can think of that she was cast in the main role, is because of her striking likeness to Jamie Lee Curtis in the first Halloween movie. The hair and the slight similarity in the faces.This film scared the bejeezus out of me when I was young, and after getting it on DVD, having not seen it for years, I wondered if it would have the same effect. It sure as hell did! I nearly hit the roof when various skeletons decided to jump out their tombs or whatever, or screams I wasn't expecting. The finale scared me a lot more when I was younger; now I just find it really sad.With a cast including Owen Wilson (with a very bad haircut), Catherine Zeta Jones and Liam Neeson, this is a film that has to be seen, although the female characters are loads stronger than the male characters. I've seen quite a few bad reviews about it, about character development severely lacking. And apparently there's a book too? I know about the original movie, although never seen it. There's virtually no sexual content in this movie, which makes it stand out from the rest of the other movies along similar lines. There's a lot of criticism towards Catherine's (Theo) bi-sexual character too, and what seemed to be a possibility for a storyline between her & Nell. I found their \"relationship\" to be very subtle: nothing ever happens, but given half a chance, I think Theo would have more than introduced her back into the world.If you've seen House On Haunted Hill, with Famke Janssen, then you'll notice similarities between the two movies. The title of this also had to be changed from The Haunting of Hill House to simply, The Haunting, as House On Haunted Hill was released a few months later.The creaks and moans heard throughout the house were pre-recorded and played during filming in order to get a more natural expression of fear out of the actors. Liam Neeson is afraid of heights so his fear when he was dangling off the flight of steps whilst trying to save Nell (Lili Taylor), required no acting.The sets are amazing in this movie, as are the sound effects, although the special effects can be slightly dodgy at times. There's two trailers (why two?), and a making of featurette, which I won't be rushing to watch.If you like scary movies, and haven't seen the original, or read the book, then you'll probably like this. If you have seen or read, then you'll be sorely disappointed. If you like this too, look out for Thirteen Ghosts (even scarier) and House On Haunted Hill.",

I thoroughly loved the scenes involving Lili Taylor's character Nell being tormented by the spirit of the deceased owner of the house, especially the scenes in her bedroom. Another favorite scene involved Liam Neeson when he was alone in that garden room with that water fountain and the statue comes alive and tries to drown Liam's character. Without giving too much away, I thought it was a bit too predictable the way Owen Wilson's character bought the farm but that scene made me cringe in my seat, and still does to this day.

It's unfortunate, however, as the film starts to fall apart until it gets absolutely ridiculous in the finale.Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) wants to perform a study on fear. To do this, he plans on pretending he is doing a study on insomnia at the Crain estate, an isolated mansion nine miles from the closest town. The &quot;test subjects&quot; that arrive include Eleanor (Lili Taylor), a hard-working woman who has had little success in life; Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an adventuress and proclaimed bi-sexual; and Luke (Owen Wilson), who just plain has sleeping troubles.On the first night in the mansion, they hear thundering sounds, but pass it off as a problem in the plumbing. Then things begin to get more bizarre, as Eleanor sees a skeleton inside the fireplace, that just as soon disappears. That's when she discovers the secret the house holds and how it connects with her.1999's other haunted house thriller was far better and scarier, as director Jan De Bont's The Haunting features only one truly creepy scene, which involves Taylor and what she sees of herself in the mirror. There aren't any even decent jump-in-your-seat shocks that make watching a horror film a more fun experience.Of course, it gets even worse. Now, to be fair, the film was getting rather dull by the 90 minute mark so I was initially entertained by the effects-filled finale. But only initially because it gets positively ridiculous in the last ten minutes, as we find out ghosts like to play hide-and-seek and smash things up real good.The only thing that keeps this film from being truly awful is the cast, and they do their best to keep the film respectable. Liam Neeson delivers the best performance. Catherine Zeta-Jones shows a lot of life, as does Owen Wilson. It's a pity that Lili Taylor's performance, which was decent at first, turned into borderline camp by the finale.With nary a true scare in sight, this film is best to be viewed by those who scare easily, special effects fans, or somebody who is a fan of the cast. Everybody else should approach the film cautiously.",

It doesn fright you as much as the &quot;old Haunting&quot; because you see &quot;animated&quot; ghosts in the remake! In the original you dont see ghosts at all and thats much scarier! Its an intertaining movie which I saw about 12 times and I never get enough of it! A must see for every fan of the ghosthouse-stories! With some good Special Features!!! And an ugly, frog-looking-like ghost called &quot;Hugh Craine&quot;",

I also found the other characters in the movie quiet boring, and the plot confused me until the third time I watched it. But if you like slow-paced movies that eventually end, then this is for you.",

Catherine Zeta Jones tries to charm her way through, but even though she does an okay job, the movie is still bad. Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson also try to add flavour to it all, but cannot manage to save the day. All we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content. It all seems to be over before it really begins, and nothing really makes much sense. And the eerie mood is almost totally absent. Not a good omen for a &quot;horror&quot; movie, is it?I just can't believe what went wrong for Neeson. Usually he drags a movie up, not down! Watch House on Haunted Hill instead, if you're into &quot;stuff-some-people-into-a-haunted-house-and-see-if-the-survive&quot; movies. Then you'll se how a proper haunting should be :)",

Catherine Zeta-Jones was good as the beautiful Theo, but Lilli's interpretation of Eleanor was tiresome and inane. Jackson's story, &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; is known by thousands as a psychological study of loneliness and madness; it ain't about using millions of dollars worth of &quot;special effects&quot; to bring the masses in, so the movie will reap finacial rewards from the producer's personal gain.

I already had a lot of respect for the original as a neat little 60's horror flick but this movie made it look even better in comparison. Why didn't they leave it alone? It didn't help that the original was a classic. But they messed up here. I hardly ever say this, but the effects were overdone--they didn't make up for the putrid script or lack of scares. There was only one moment when I jumped and that was because everyone else in the theater screamed and scared me. Plenty of people were laughing at parts that were not supposed to be funny--not a good sign. There was just no excuse for the amazingly stupid line, &quot;It's about family!&quot; which would make you wince under any circumstances but came at what was supposed to be the climax of the film. The house is supposed to look old, but it is so obvious that it was just created by a set designer or is CGI. Really not very scary. The sound was good, I'll give it that, but that was about it. The writers obviously just threw in Theo's character being bisexual because they knew the guys who think Zeta-Jones is hot would get off on it--unlike the novel, where there is a point to it. Really, see a matinee--if you really MUST see it, that is, which I do not recommend--and see it while the theaters are still packed, which makes it more of a thrill ride. All the so called 'scares' and CGI in this film put together do not even measure up to be 10% as scary as the scene in the original where Nell thinks Theo is holding her hand in bed but turns on the light to see her friend across the room, who had been asleep in her own bed. I had a bad feeling about this movie when I saw the trailer months ago that featured the tagline &quot;Some Houses Are Born Bad&quot;. Should have stuck with my original instincts on this one and saved my time and my 7+ bucks. Do yourself a favor and rent the original instead.",

The elements -- including the cast, from a pouting, bi-sexual Catherine Zeta-Jones to an achingly sincere Lillian Taylor, and the plot, which takes a classic Shirley Jackson story and actually takes away the terror -- are each so bad that the end result is one of those movies you watch and say -- how did this ever get made? Redeeming qualities: the set, which is so massive and full of detail that it is interesting to explore, and a few of the special effects, which unfortunately do not help you to understand the absurdly diluted-and-then-regurgitated plot. There could have been a great horror movie from that story, but this is definitely not it.",

If they were intended to be a distraction, they didn't work.I have to admit, my review is based only on the first 30 or so minutes of the movie. That was all I could take before I got up off the couch, rewound the film, and promptly returned to the video store.",

    "review/text": "Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta Jones, and Owen Wilson spend a special effects laden night in a haunted house in &quot;The Haunting&quot;, the new thriller from &quot;Twister&quot;-&quot;Speed&quot; director Jan De Bont. The film starts at a slow pace, getting to know characters Elenore (Taylor) and Dr. Morrow (Neeson). Then moving on to a night in Hill House: a beautiful turn of the century mansion in New England. The three (others Zeta Jones and Wilson) are there under the watchful eye of Morrow, all there for a study in insomnia. But, insomnia study is just a red herring for Morrow's real study: fear. For there is a long ago urban legend about Hill House- that the original owner named Crane, haunts the very bowels of his huge home. Soon enough, everyone (still alive) are running from collapsing stiar cases, bulging floors and celines, possesed windows, a lion headed pendulum, a huge Eagle stutue brought to life, and Crane's own powerful ghost. The movie seems to be redeeming itself for the slowness, until an ending (which I won't reveal) that just dosen't make sense. The special effects aren't bad, the acting is about as good (really only by Taylor), but the way the story is executed is wrong. &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; is a horror story. 1999's version of &quot;The Haunting&quot; is a big flashy action extravaganza. Someone like Richard Donner (&quot;The Omen&quot;, &quot;Leatal Weapon 1,2,3, and 4&quot;) or Stephen Sommers (&quot;Deep Rising&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;) or even Joe Dante (&quot;Gremlins, Small Soldiers&quot;) should have directed this movie. Oh well. There are always more fx movies, especially this year. My opinion: see &quot;The Haunting&quot; if you wish, but first, see &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot;, and to a lesser extent &quot;Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace.&quot;",

It(This one) starts out similar to the original, but then changes. It adds the Childrens' ghosts and those things. Though I think the door might have been made similar to a book they find in the 1963 movie(The door with hell and purgatory). It doesn't have the neat, and dizzying, camera angles from the first one. Instead it adds alot of special affects(Wich I will give them credit for doing a good job on, some credit that is). But compared to the first one.....It is really not that good or scary. If you want to see a good scary movie, than see the Original &quot;The Haunting&quot;, Or the &quot;Innocents&quot;(Wich is very scary), or &quot;The Changeling&quot;. Leave this one on the shelf, Save your money and get a real, scary horror movie, such as the ones I mentioned above.",

    "review/summary": "Effective as a funhouse of effects!",
    "review/text": "&quot;The Haunting&quot; is one of the lamest attempts at creating a horror story I've ever seen, but in terms of funhouse style and visual effects, Jan de Bont has created a haunted house with style, elegance, and even some terror. The sequence of events never really takes hold as it should, and like de Bont's previous film, &quot;Twister,&quot; it's merely an outlet for the visual effects. But that doesn't mean one can't have fun with the film.The central story centers around a psychiatrist, Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson), inviting three unsuspecting strangers to a haunted house under the guise that they are participating in an experiment on insomnia. There's Luke (Owen Wilson), a typical guy who starts running after the charms of Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the bisexual jetsetter who has a unique zest for life. And then there's timid little Eleanor (Lili Taylor), whose fragile feelings will become the centrifuge for the many bizarre occurrences during their stay.Once in the house, things begin to go bump in the night. Their first night in the house provides a very chilling atmosphere, as strange and inexplicable poundings on walls and bedroom doors begin waking Nell and Theo from sleep. This is quite an experience for any audience who enjoys a good theater jolt: the very presence of the entity on the other side of that door can be felt through the extreme poundings and echoes throughout the house when things quiet down. De Bont is able to create an atmosphere that is enveloping and frightening in one.But at this point, the story takes a nosedive, tying shy Nell's past to the house itself, resulting in a forthcoming conclusion that is more laughable than it is touching. The final showdown isn't very effective, and there's little to talk about once the movie is over in terms of its storyline progression (ask anyone, and they'll describe the second half as a lot of running around, in and out of the house, only to find themselves running again.And that running is exactly what the movie seems to be doing the entire time. It seems to be so confused about its own sequences of events that, when there comes a time for the movie to conclude, it decides to throw something else in for the sake of it being there, whether it works with the story or not.So, in order to enjoy &quot;The Haunting,&quot; one must put any sense of logic aside, and just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a ride it is, containing some of the most dazzling and effective special effects money can buy and putting them to good use. De Bont literally brings us into Hill House, making us believe in the entities that thrive there even if their purposes are just as unbelievable.One scene involving a staircase with a mind of its own is particularly effective. Dr. Marrow hangs on for dear life as the iron stairs begin falling out from under his feet, in a slow process that is never tedious or without suspense. Another scene that jumps to mind takes place in Nell's bedroom, as the entire room begins to breathe itself to life, collapsing on her, taking on ghostly characteristics. This is one visually striking antagonist.The house itself, without the ghostly appearances, is magnificent, making the Xanadu of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; look like a third-world trailer park. Taking on some very tasteful and elaborate colors and designs, the house is beautiful and breathtaking while also possessing a menacing demeanor. Everything is large, obtrusive, looming, reducing our characters to meager inhabitants amidst a vast ocean of doors and hallways.The characters themselves are animated by some very nice talent. Dr. Marrow is played by Liam Neeson, who comes across as serious in scenes with dialogue that would induce laughter from most actors. Catherine Zeta-Jones may not be a believable switch-hitter, but her charm and exuberance fill the role with zest and sex appeal, something to be admired. Owen Wilson has some very subtle moments of comedy as Luke, while Lili Taylor steals the show as Eleanor, filling her character with fear and strength in one.&quot;The Haunting&quot; is nothing like the novel on which it is based, nor is it anything like the superior 1963 original film. But at the same time, it's increasingly atmospheric and ominous, two things a haunted house film needs! De Bont's sense of style and effect come in handy in this funhouse of a film, which is worse than you had hoped, and better than you had feared.",

Let me start this off by saying I'm an RABID horror fan and have been for over 20 years - I love ALL types of movies, from the classics to the painfully dull bargain bin selections. I knew when this one came out in theaters, to stay FAR AWAY and not waste my money on the price of admission. A year or so later, I finally caught it on cable and figured, &quot;Oh, why not, I'll watch it.&quot; Bad choice - I lost just about 2 hours of precious time I could have spent picking out bellybutton lint or cleaning my cat's litterbox. I'm trying to locate a copy of the book, so I can read it again and see just how badly this Shirley Jackson story was ruined, as my memory of the original is quite fuzzy. All I know is that she must be rolling around in her grave, waiting for a chance to get her hands around the director's neck.What a steaming pile this movie is... since when did using CGI become the only way to get &quot;scares&quot; out of the audience? I miss the horror of the 80s, 70s, 60s and so on... back then, people actually had relatively fresh ideas (in most cases) and could execute them in a creative way. Could you imagine if the Exorcist had been done today, by someone fond of CGI? The actors wouldn't have had to spend grueling hours in a freezing cold room, with REAL breath rising like steam from their lips - the director could have had the breath drawn in digitally, like in THIS stinker, and the effect would have been absolutely ruined.Bah... ugly moaning cherubs (Same moans used over and over too! Tacky!), horrible cliches, huge old guys and a monstrously large mansion you just KNOW nobody's lived in - this movie blows. I'm gonna go watch the ORIGINAL movie from the 60's now, and I suggest you do the same. Avoid this movie... it's a serious waste of perfectly good time AND money if you rent it.",

    "review/text": "Being a fan of horror movies and having never seen the original 1963 film, I found myself eager to catch this remake, which looked interesting from the theatrical trailer. However, I could have never been more mistaken. THE HAUNTING, with its expensive special effects and large budget, looks more like a 'tamed' episode from TV's Goosebumps than an actual feature film. What's worse is that this incredibly dull chiller lacks what many of these types of films require to work...chills! Infact, the only scary thing about this flick is how DreamWorks managed to green-light this expensive dud into production. The paper-thin plot finds a psychological researcher tricking a group of people to staying a night at a haunted mansion in hopes of studying them and their reactions. While the cast seems promising, they are surprisingly wasted...Neeson especially, with Catherine Zeta Jones offering a pretty face to look at, but nothing more. And surprisingly, I never thought that director Jan DeBont could top the horrendous Speed 2: Cruise Control, but once again I was wrong. All in all, THE HAUNTING was one of 1999's biggest Hollywood disappointments and, in my opinion, I would seriously consider that you walk passed this one at the video store. DROUGH!",

    "review/text": "The Haunting is the latest version of The Haunting of Hill House, and as far as basic films go, it's not too bad. With Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta Jones, plus every special effect possible, should be difficult to go wrong.However, the Haunting is lacking a certain - something. There are occasions where it hovers between being an out and out gore fest and a psychological thriller, never giving itself to either of the two. The characters are not brilliantly developed, leaving the viewer relying on rather cliched first impressions. The character of Eleanor, particularly, is left to languish when there is much more we could know about her, notably her links to Hill House. One of the main characters gets killed off apparently as an afterthought (coming to a decidedly sticky end in the fireplace) when Neeson and Zeta Jones who had the same level of importance were staggering out at the end.The story may be a bit confusing, but the effects are very good, taking full advantage of ornate and intricate decorations to threaten and foreshadow (who didn't wonder, seeing the long decorative spikes above Eleanor's bed, what they would be doing later on?) However effects don't make a film (I may be wrong, look at the Matrix) and this could have benefitted from a more thought out script. Otherwise, not a bad hour or so.",

    "review/text": "I thought this was a very good movie and am quite surprised to see so many negative reviews of it. I am a horror fan and a Shirley Jackson fan, so I am not judging this movie in an intellectual vacuum. It really does not bother me that the makers of this flick took Jackson's basic premise and went in a completely new direction with it. It would be all but impossible to dramatize Jackson's original novel theatrically because the bulk of the story lies in the emotions, thoughts, and fears of the characters, especially Eleanor. I felt that the film did a very good job of portraying the sad isolation and fragile emotions of Eleanor, and I liked the portrayal of the other characters. Catherine Zeta Jones is wonderful as the complex Theo. With the exception of one short scene, Lili Taylor was a more than adequate Eleanor. The special effects, with the exception of a short hair-brushing scene, are excellent and well done; they do not, in my opinion, take precedence over the story but richly add to the atmosphere of the house. The ghostly manifestations are appropriately creepy, tastefully restrained, and wonderfully subtle in detail. The only flaws I found in the movie are probably the result of time constraints; more time was needed in order to adequately explain Eleanor's growing obsession with the house and her acceptance of the impressions coming from the spirits of the children &quot;trapped&quot; in the house. The turning point, where Eleanor comes to understand the evils Hugh Crain committed in the house and magically discovers the existence of a second Crain wife, does not make adequate sense based on the facts shown to the viewer and thus cries out for further elucidation. The ending of the film is slightly unsatisfying yet somehow seems right and appropriate. While this movie is not really scary and does not reflect the much richer storyline of Jackson's original novel, it nonetheless strikes me as a surprisingly good, enjoyable movie, head and shoulders above most other films in the horror/suspense genre.",

Another example of Hollywood's fetish with drugs, no doubt. This has NOTHING in common with one of the most superior novels ever written (on which it CLAIMS to be based). I think Jackson ought to come back and haunt De Bont for this travesty. Is THIS what happens when you are apportioned 150 trillion dollars for special effects and 2-cents for screenplay development/scriptwriting? For the most honest to the book and TRULY chilling version, check out Robert Wise's 1963 The Haunting which delves into the psychology of all involved: who -- or what --is really haunted? If you are stuck in the &quot;I need to see blood and an intestine swinging from the chandelier&quot; mode, just stick to your &quot;Jason&quot; movies.

Who really needs it? The most blood and guts I've ever seen in a movie is Braveheart, and that was acceptable to me because it was historic. This movie is very commendable for its special effects, its high-talent acting, and top-notch crew. The DVD version is very well-crafted, with two theatrical trailers, bios, and a making-of featurette. The Dolby soundtracks are stock-piled with scary sounds and crystal clear booms and shatters. The images are sharp and bursting with color. If you need a break from blood, then get this one- it's a winner.",

Are there some interesting special effects sure, but I have seen too many movies to be dazzled by special effects alone. This was a poor imitation of the early Vincent Price black-and-white. I read somewhere that Liam Neeson was embarassed about his performance in Star Wars. What about this one? The plot was so thin, in the original Vincent Price offers people money for them to stay the night in house if they can brave it; in this one Liam Neeson tells the people who are insomnia sufferers that he is experimenting on their disordering really masking that it is a experiment on fear. Here's one of the real kickers about the movie. The main character is Lili Taylor, not Catherine Zeta-Jones or Neeson. I can only imagine this had something to do with the salaries. If you are expecting to see Zeta-Jones all throughout the movie, you won't. It is more than a cameo but is definitely a supporting role. If you would rather see Lili than Catherine then you are one in a few, and if Catherine does not even appeal to you then this movie has no redeeming qualities. Stay away.",

I had hoped that with all the special effects, this re-make would be able to intensify the creepiness of the 1963 film, or even the original novel by Shirley Jackson. I've read a lot of horror novels, and &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; is one of the few books to give me that delicious &quot;frisson&quot; in the middle of the night. The Robert Wise film managed to capture this feeling and make the hair on the back of my arms stand at attention. Sadly, this version did not, largely because, once again, Big Hollywood felt the need to step in and improve the story. The worst line in the film hast to be &quot;It was always about family.&quot; Sorry Eleanor, but it was NEVER about family -- it was about a creepy house with a mind of its own. The house was supposed to be the antagonist, not Hugh Crain.In addition to the story flaws, there were some problems with the acting. I usually love Lili Taylor, and I thought she'd be a perfect Eleanor, but her performance falls a little flat. The same goes for Liam Neeson,from whom I also expected a better performance. Either both of them were having a really rough period, or the fault lies with the script. (And I've already harped on that!) Catherine Zeta-Jones's performance didn't really bother me, but maybe that's because she played the same type of character she always seems to play (I had this response to her performance in &quot;High Fidelity&quot; as well). As for Owen Wilson...well, his nose bothered me. But that's really more of a personal thing.I am assured by some friends of mine that this is a perfectly enjoyable film if you haven't read the novel, or seen the original film.

    "review/text": "I love the original 1963 release of The Haunting, so I ask as other people do about lesser remakes of films, why try to fix what works? God knows this mess certainly doesn't. The 1963 film may have been in black and white, but it was downright bone chilling because of the power of persuasion. This remake reminded me of a tourist attraction in Spring Green, Wisconsin called House on the Rock, except it's a hell of a lot more entertaining. Bad computerized effects plague this production from start to finish, not to mention marring the characterization and plotline of Shirley Jackson's wonderful Hill House novel.What Liam Neeson could have been thinking to sign on for this role is beyond me, but they can have goofy old Lily Taylor and Catherine \"Conceita\" Jones. Why do we have to hear her talk about her alternative swinging lifestyle as if we're too dumb to get it? When Claire Bloom played the REAL Theo, the roadsigns were more discreet, but we got it. I guess Hollywood thinks we're too retarded to figure things out on our own without big neon signs flashing the overly obvious.This movie is so bad it's almost funny, except that it's amusing only in a bad way. It is too deluged with special effects, lousy dialogue, and an even worse distorted plot to even pass as campy. The only redeeming part of this film was when the annoying Owen Wilson got his goofy looking head decapitated by a swinging stone lion's head. In the words of 80s metal heads, AWESOME DUDE!!! In other words, don't watch this movie alone...at night...in the dark. In fact, don't watch it at any other time alone or with anyone else. They'll think you've gone barky.",

The scientist tricks his subjects into coming to Hill House (claiming to study sleep, when in reality he's studying fear), which is an unecessary change to the original plot.There are some gory effects and obvious ghosts. The audience figures out what's going on early in the film, long before any of the characters. Early on, a ghost child asks Lili Taylor for help. Gee, think maybe some ghost children are in trouble? She's not sure.The characters' responses are stupid and unnatural. One moment they're expressing affection, the next scene they're expressing indifference or hate. The average summer camp slasher film features smarter, more realistic characters.Aside from a beautiful set and two gory effects (including a decapitation), there's not much to recommend this film. See the original 1963 film instead, which had no gore but was through-provoking and scary, with likeable, intriguing characters.",

The main ingredient of the artistic success that made the 1963 original a classic in its genre was the lack of effects (which might have been technically impossible at that time anyway).As soon as the evil becomes visible, it materializes and we can face it and battle against it. This was avoided in the original and stressed to the maximum in this remake.In the former version, the protagonists are haunted psychologically and the viewer as well. In the latter, Hugh Crane seems more like an alien. The technical execution (which is perfect) undoubtedly causes excitement but not fear, thrill but no chill. That's why I would call the film (at least the last third)a science fiction or an action movie rather than a horror picture.Although this all is true, I'd consider the many negative critics unfair, for there are quite some moments (especially in the first third)that really scared me and which made the film bitwise even superior to the original. This production will certainly not belong to the career climaxes of all the persons involved in, but it won't affect them either, for it's an enjoyable piece of nowadays' mainstream cinema after all.",

    "review/text": "For a horror story whose &quot;terror factor&quot; is premised primarily (at least in the beginning) on implied/imagined rather than &quot;in-your-face&quot; fear, it is inevitable that&quot;The Haunting&quot; pales when juxtaposed with its contemporary (Blair Witch). The acting of all the main characters (especially by Taylor) was top-notch though, and the sets were truly awesome and breathtaking (notwithsanding certain special effects which, although technically and visually impressive, at times appeared more appropriate for a sanitized, Disney-type of thriller movie rather than a serious horror film which The Haunting obviously tries to be). Still found this quite entertaining overall, although I do consider myself quite a horror buff and may as a result be somewhat biased for the genre in general. You probably won't regret buying this film if its to &quot;augment&quot; the horror film section of your DVD collection, but I don't recommend this for starters (lots of better DVD films both in story and in features out there like Blair Witch of course).",

    "review/text": "When I read that Wes Craven was remaking Robert Wise's brilliant 1963 chiller THE HAUNTING, I cringed. Why remake a film that got it right the first time around? Then I thought of the audience that the studio had in mind and I had my answer: summer movie box office. The project left the hands of Wes Craven and ended up in the lap of Jan DeBont, a gentleman who really should return to his day job as a director of photography. Like his previous TWISTER and SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL, DeBont's THE HAUNTING is utterly lacking in characterization, visual style, and plot. Nothing really happens in this film. The house itself is a gargantuan monstrosity - who could believe that anyone would inhabit it out of their own volition? In fact, the film is a real downer. It's so disheartening to see Liam Neeson and Lily Taylor, two of cinema's finest performers, virtually wasted in their roles. Marian Seldes, a fine stage actress, does what she can with her turn as Mrs. Dudley, who was so wonderfully immortalized by Rosalie Crutchley in the original version. Believe it or not, Bruce Dern turns up as Mr. Dudley, looking positively out of his mind with berzerk white hair. He was once one of the finest screen actors in the '70's. Catch him in THE KING OF MARVIN GARDENS and COMING HOME to see what I mean. Lastly, Catherine Zeta-Jones, who was wonderful in THE MASK OF ZORRO, does her best sauntering from scene to scene attempting to remain interested. Her best scene is her introduction to Lily Taylor. Her dialog is sophomoric, but she looks positively breathtaking.Most disturbing, however, is realizing who edited this film: none other than Michael Kahn, one of the best film editors in the business. I can't imagine that the man who cut some of Steven Spielberg's best and most successful films needed the money this desperately.To think that the 1963 version made little money at the time of its release is a crime when you consider how big this movie was during the summer. The blame should be placed on the audience for paying to see this dreck. They do a fine job of telling Hollywood to keep churning out awful movies. The original THE HAUNTING is a masterpiece of filmmaking: intelligently written, superbly photographed, brilliantly scored, acted, and directed. It needs an anamorphic release on DVD.As a DVD, the transfer of the new version of THE HAUNTING is spectacular and the sound is stunning. But what good are all these bells and whistles if the movie stinks? For a spectacular film experience featuring well-rounded characters and a frighteningly good time, opt for POLTERGEIST (also edited by Michael Kahn!), a film that stands up after multiple viewings.If you're male and really need a reason to see THE HAUNTING, it is for Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's truly stunning, and certainly worth the price of the DVD rental.",

    "review/summary": "The Humorous Haunting Of Humongous Hill House",
    "review/text": "The Haunting is a movie originally made in 1963, based on Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting Of Hill House (1959). The story is about four paranormal investigators who spend time at Hill House, a 90-year old mansion in New England that is said to be haunted. During their stay, they find out over time that the house really is haunted. The house seems alive and it wants to keep one of the investigators, Eleanor, in the house.Fast forward 36 years to 1999. A remake was made.I watched this 1999 remake of The Haunting on YouTube from start to finish (a big thank you to the person who uploaded it). I had never seen it before tonight. I definitely wasn't missing anything (except maybe Lili Taylor's good looks). This was a pointless remake of the classic 1963 original and it fails on all levels. Robert Wise got it right in 1963!!!!!!!!!!!! This 1999 remake? It's equivalent to trying to remake The Wizard Of Oz. Better yet, I felt like I was watching an elementary school play called The Haunting, except the actors were adults. Don't mess with the classics, that's what I say. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Too often, the movie makers fall all over themselves when they remake classic movies. But we all know the real motivation behind the remake$. It's $$$$$. They always say it's to introduce the young people of today to old classic movies. My philosophy is this: JUST SHOW THEM THE ORIGINAL!!!! But that would make too much sense. They also have to throw in the CGI special effects, otherwise boredom will set in on the young audience. And they MUST be color movies. No black and white - that's a no-no. This remake is geared towards attention-deficit young people who always need constant visual stimulation in order to be entertained and avoid boredom.What's wrong with this movie? EVERYTHING! This movie compared to the original is like comparing apples and oranges. First of all, Shirley Jackson's story was completely massacred in this remake. The original movie stays faithful to the novel. The remake, on the other hand, doesn't. This remake movie is so different than the original movie, but every once in a while you'll hear a familiar line from the original. Very weird. Secondly, the movie is in color. Color isn't nearly as effective as black and white for this type of movie. Of course the movies of today are going to be in color, but if you're going to remake The Haunting at all, give at least SOME consideration to shooting in black and white.The acting for the most part is wooden. The actors in this 1999 movie don't come anywhere near the actors in the 1963 original in acting ability and screen presence. Catherine Zeta-Jones (who plays Theo) has an air about her that suggests that she thinks she's so sexy. This is the character she's playing. Unfortunately, she's not nearly as good as Claire Bloom from the original. Lili Taylor (who plays Eleanor) tries hard but falls short of the performance of Julie Harris. To me, Lili looks like a young Jamie Lee Curtis. She seems to be training for the 200 meter dash throughout this movie, perhaps for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. They made her a different character altogether, too - she's a lot nicer than Nell from the original. Liam Neeson isn't nearly as good as Richard Johnson in the role of Dr. John Markway or whatever his name is in this remake (I believe it's Dr. Marrow). Plus, he looks bored and totally out of place, like he's just going through the motions and collecting his paycheck. Maybe he was just physically and mentally drained from all those light sabre fights in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999). Owen Wilson is no Russ Tamblyn. Those pajamas are, well, funny. I thought he'd never calm down and catch his breath after Liam Neeson unintentionally scared him. What's with the \"carnival\" room that spins around? Hill House seems like it's a haunted attraction and an amusement park rolled into one. I'll stop there, because it just gets worse. Actually, one more thing - Mrs. Dudley in this movie isn't nearly as scary as in the original. When Mrs. Dudley says the famous line \"In the night...in the dark\" for a second time, Eleanor actually finishes the sentence for her. By Eleanor doing this, it destroys and cheapens one of the classic lines from the original movie. Basically, Eleanor is making fun of Mrs. Dudley's sentence instead of being frightened or concerned about it. I also notice that the characters seem thin, like they lack depth. They're just sort of there, saying their lines from a bad script that was given to them. They look like they don't know what to do half the time. It's equivalent to teenagers from a slasher film who are just set up to be killed by a psycho stalker. No character development. Plus, what's with the argument between Zeta-Jones and Neeson? Very weird. It even turns physical.Hill House looks more like a gothic castle than a haunted mansion, and it's HUGE. I don't know how anybody can actually live there. The place is humongous. The fireplace looks like it would devour anybody who goes near it. The doors in the place seem like they're 20 feet high. Everything in this movie is BIG, OVERDONE, and OBVIOUS compared to the original.Black and white is the way to go for a movie like this. In the original movie, Robert Wise brilliantly used black and white with unique camera angles and shadows and lighting to create a haunted atmosphere. In this remake, color was used and it ruins the atmosphere. The CGI effects? Totally cheesy and funny. I was laughing throughout most of the movie, saying, \"What IS this?\" When you try to make radical changes to a classic, forget it. You've already struck out. In this movie, you actually SEE the ghosts. They also appear in weird, contorted forms and all shapes and sizes, even underneath curtains, bed sheets, and a fist through a door. Weird...and funny. This movie is pretty much like watching Scooby Doo (fun and frights combined), except Scooby Doo is more frightening. You didn't see the ghosts in the original movie. You just knew they were there. It's what you can't see that is so scary. That's how it should be.A skeleton that comes alive? This stuff is straight out of a homemade basement haunted house made by 8-year olds.The lesbian relations between Eleanor and Theo is more apparent and obvious in this movie than in the original. This movie leaves nothing to the imagination. Obvious lesbian relations, obvious ghosts, obvious haunts, etc. Upon their first meeting, it takes Theo a matter of seconds to let Eleanor know she's a lesbian. She basically \"came out\" as soon as she met Eleanor. In the original the lesbianism was more implied than obvious. It left the viewer to wonder if it existed at all.I find it interesting that this remake was made 36 years after the original came out. Usually when remakes are done, it's 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 years later. In this situation, it was an oddball 36 years later, in 1999. Maybe the makers of this movie were afraid that Y2K would prevent them from using their beloved CGI effects, so they rushed the movie into production and made the movie an oddball 36 years after the original and released it in 1999, months before the December 31, 1999 Y2K concern (and massive fraud, by the way)! I'm joking, but you never know...Now, I'll mention some strong points to this movie. The atmosphere WAS creepy in a lot of scenes. The portraits on the walls added a very haunting feeling, as did the cherubs sometimes. Some of the lighting added some creepiness. The movie IS visually stunning in a lot of places. But overall, this movie can't hold a Hill House candle to the original.The last half hour of the movie is what really brings the movie down. Suddenly it's over-the-top CGI mania. A complete Cheese Fest.If you like the classic original movie from 1963, don't bother with this 1999 remake. Terrible. It should be renamed The Humorous Haunting Of Humongous Hill House. If Shirley Jackson was still around I wonder what she would think of this disaster of a movie. I give this movie a very generous 1 star.",

    "review/text": "This is a very old-fashioned haunted house tale given the overblown budget treatment that doesn't enhance the story as much as Hollywood would have us think. It's a fun movie, but it doesn't scare or jolt you like it should or could. While I was disappointed with that, I still enjoyed the film for the creepy house which is beautifully designed, and the cast of wonderful actors who are all capable of better work, except for Owen Wilson who just annoys me with his presence. His surfer-dude schtick just grates on you after awhile. Lili Taylor makes this movie all hers inspite of the impressive cast.The film is rather tame in that their is no nudity or sex, and little in the way of gore or violence. I like a spooky film that I can watch with my entire family. I have my daughter, 10, close her eyes for the one violent scene in the film. Others be warned that one might not want younger kids to see the one death scene at the end, a decapitation, but even that scene is swiftly edited and lacks any real gore or bloodshed, but it is probably how this overall tame film got its \"R\" rating as the rest of the film is purely PG (not even PG-13). With even better editing, that death scene could have been more suggested than visual and that is the biggest problem with this film: too much focus on the visual. Nothing is creepily suggested as a better horror film would do.In any event, this is simple, old-fashioned spookiness with A+ special effects that take over the film a bit unnecessarily. The setting, set designs, and cinematography are all top-notch. The acting, with the exception of Lili Taylor, is rather pedestrian, but they are mostly believable. It may not be frightening, but it is haunting and memorable inspite of its flaws.",

    "review/text": "On paper, 'The Haunting' promises to deliver all sorts of traditional horror-flick chills and thrills, and with such a stellar cast, the movie certainly looks like it's going to deliver. Sadly, in reality, this is not the case, and 'The Haunting' rapidly descends into a hodgepodge of stilted momentum and out-of-place histrionics.Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson, selling his considerable talent out for a dollar) has assembled a group of sleep-deprived people in a supposedly haunted house to conduct an experiment in the power of suggestion. Of this group, Nell Vance (Lili Taylor) is plagued by sinister forces throughout her stay, and it's up to Dr. Marrow and his other patients, boho-chic Theo (Catherine Z-J) and n'er-do-well playboy Luke (Owen Wilson), to save Nell and themselves from the malevolent spectres haunting the house.None of the cast could be blamed for not doing their level best with a lousy, awkward script. Neeson and Taylor are two of the finest actors working today, and even their portrayals of their own characters come off as insincere and mawkish. Zeta-Jones, an actress of considerable talent, does slightly better in the role of the promiscuous and mysterious Theo, but that's due mainly to the fact that she physically looks the part. The talents of Owen Wilson, too, are lost in a two-dimensional character, lacking both development and sympathy.The locations, you can tell, were intended to be sweeping and absorbing, and a lot of design and research has clearly gone into making the House the real star of the show. Shame, then, that it looks like some sort of anodyne Disney-Fun thrill house, instead of a brooding mansion harbouring dark secrets. The carved faces of the children look like something out of the Addams Family Household, and the legion rooms and chambers are as unbelievable in number as they are overstated in design. Coupled with some laughable special effects (doors and porticoes coming together to make faces, the particularly risible end sequence) the House is merely the lewd, bawdy, amateurish backdrop against which this sad little tale is played out.Direction? Not really. Jan De Bont is responsible for some of the most directorially-accomplished thrillers of our time (Speed, Twister, What Lies Beneath) but has apparently left his thinking cap at home for this one.And to finish, for those of you who may have read the book first, this film lacks any of the subtle psychology or endearing character traits of Shirley Jackson's classic novel noir. It even goes so far as to change the ending from a melancholy and desolate event to a cheap, tawdry Hollywood-Esque 'Big Bang', and by the movie's end, we're left wondering exactly what has happened and why we wasted so much time watching 'The Haunting' at all.A no-brainer of extreme proportions, there are far better examples of this sort of thing available.",

Instead, it's just a tragic failure that's not even scary with bad acting, boring characters who have absolutely NO character development, and a plot that may sound original at first, but gets REALLY boring later. After reading some of these reviews here, I decided to watch it anyways even if everybody else didn't like it cause I might have. NOPE. I now know what everyone here was talking about. I think that this is the MOST crappiest Haunted House movie in a long time that should have only gotten a straight-to-video release because it's very dull! TRUST ME, I know horror movies! If you're looking for a good haunted house flick, then watch &quot;The House On Haunted Hill&quot; (1999) or &quot;Thir13een Ghosts&quot; (2001) because they are at least scary and intelligent!",

The film turned out to be what I expected it to be. A lot of special effects, simplified story and by no means could that movie capture the feel of the novel or the brilliant adaption by Robert Wise. The actors in Wises' flic were all together brilliant, in De-Bont's version only Lily Taylor can sometimes live up to the original film. The original film lived from the &quot;to-thrill-is-not-to-show&quot; atmosphere and what made this movie so good were the actors, the music, the camera angles and the cuts - nothing of this is present in this remake, just a bunch of special effects.So my recommendation would be - read the book, watch the movie by Robert Wise but avoid the remake.",

But hey, this is Hollywood-- who needs subtlety when you've got computer graphics? An utter waste of a talented cast and a gorgeously sinister set, The Haunting leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. Its mildly creepy beginning, quickly dissolves into a lot of people running around while things explode and/or do something expensive around them. Likewise, the CGI effects are nifty when they're scarcely used, but get less and less convincing as they take up more and more of the screen. (I won't even mention the lovable ghost children.) There is one, only one, good scare in the entire movie. Neeson just mopes, and Zeta-Jones fans may be disappointed that she flirts more with Lili Taylor than anyone else. Taylor herself is wonderful as usual, despite a finale that improbably sets her up as some kind of supernatural Rambo. Owen Wilson injects some much-needed charm and comic relief into the proceedings-- and then a fireplace eats his head. If you want intelligent chills, try &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot; If you want a fun, spooky romp, check out &quot;Sleepy Hollow.&quot; Otherwise, buy the book, skip the movie.",

Now that being said let me say this movie is completly laughable. Those not too discerning about horror movies might find it scary (My wife deffinatly did, but she has never really watched horror movies period). But those who savor and cherish the horror genre will find it best to stay away from this movie. The special effects are wonderful but poorly timed for scare factor, and the ending is completly pitiful and wraps absolutly nothing. The great evil is gone but how the survivors explain any of it to the outside world is totally left off and it is something QUITE noticable. Yyou have to wrap it up when only two people walk out of a house that 5 went in to, and the caretakers basically ask what happened. But do they? No they just end the movie right there. It leaves a feeling of incompletion to the story, and not the kind of incompletion that lends itself to a sequel. Needless to say if you are NOT a horror buff you'll probably enjoy it, those who love the genre however should best watch something else.",

So you have to be patient with this movie. But in the main time, the movie is still very interesting because of the beautiful and scary lookin' house and the stories they tell about it. Inside the house, everything looks great and big which also gives you the creeps.But there are still some pretty suspenseful scenes which keeps the movie interresting and sometimes you even jump off your chair(if you have the sound a bit loud, that is).&quot;The Haunting&quot; also contains some very cool looking effects and sounds which realy makes the house living! I especialy loved the wooden children who start to live!The performances of Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson are also great and all this makes &quot;The Haunting&quot; a movie wihch you just have to see if you have a bit patient and like not very gory horror movies, because this movie hardly has any violent scenes!",

The storyline, which is already difficult to bring to the screen, was done so, with the upmost elegance.The Hauntings special effects were very well done, and thankfully not overblown.

They all played there parts perfectly, like they really were the characters, that's one of the main reasons why I loved it so much. The fact that they could play there roles so well made it happen for the movie. The story line made you think. In order to understand the movie you HAD to listen and get into it. It made you watch it and pay close attention to the film. It was also scary, very scary and ver suspensful. I love that in a movie. It's what makes you want to see it again. I could never get enough of it. However even though the story line was wonderful I think it was a little too confussing. You have to see it twice to really understand it. Other than that it was a well made, well acted, well written movie. I would and do highly recommend this to anyone who loves suspense, thrill, mystery, and suspense.",

In particular, the movie fails miserably in every way in its ability to provoke fear in any audience on any level and douses itself in the absurd. The special effects in this movie are particularly annoying and ridiculous. When I saw this movie at the theatre, I laughed out loud when I saw these stupid little manifestations of paranormal phenomenon and ghosts. This movie is not a horror movie...it is a comedy, but the problem is that this movie is only a comedy in how terribly pathetic it is.Armed with a horrendous cast and uninteresting characters, the special effects only make the movie that much worse than it could have been. The acting in \"The Haunting\" remake is horrible and that includes Catherine Zeta Jones, not to even go into the fact that the directing of this movie was also very poor. The 1963 original version of \"The Haunting\" was not a good horror movie by any means, but at least it was successful with its ghost story and paranormal theme. Any success from the original version that this remake could have relied was killed by the special effects, poor acting and poor direction. In fact, the strongsuit of the original was that it did leave something for the imagination.In short, the remake is just plain stupid and comes off as a total joke with respect to being a horror movie. Well, this is not a scary movie!!! But, if you are interested in a comical attempt at a horror movie and ghost story then you might like this farce.

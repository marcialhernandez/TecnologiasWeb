The DVD set includes the Flyboys WWI combat simulator but requires a more powerful computer than I have so I wasn't able to try that.

It was also nice that it was done in a fashion that would allow these events to have actually taken place and happened. It did not rush them like they would in the, oh say, James Bond movies, but allowed a more natural time scope. Some of the comments call it slow, and yes, it is slow, but it's a natural slowness which is nice to see in a movie.

It was like a foreign legion of the air. It shows American volunteers who joined the glorius escadrille to fight against their German foes. The film also shows that there were both good and bad, like the German pilot of the red, crossed swords marked, red colored Fokker D-VII Triplane, a good man, who spares his American nemesis realizing his machine gun was jammed. But then there was the Black Fokker pilot,also depicting the drawing of a black falcon who was a heartless butcher.This film shows the famed escadrille in action, the way it was, which is now only remembered on connoseur or expert circles. The film also demonstrates a pilot's courage in those days, lest we forget that the parachute had not been invented yet or was at least in the drawing boards, so if your aircraft was hit or disabled you could not bail out thus the pilots were given guns, so that they could shoot themselves rather than be incinerated alive. The acting was great and credible. This film is based on a true action story. Do not miss it.",

    "review/text": "Flyboys has some historical inaccuracies, but so did a lot of movies that were made about WWII. In this case, it is about WWI and it is based off of the Lafayette Escadrille, which was basically the French Air Force (then called French Air Service) during that time. There were a number of American men who joined this service to help fight for the French but also to learn to fly and become a part of history. The airplane had been invented not very long before, so for these men they really were being a part of history in more ways than one: They were the first combat pilots in a war. I wanted to talk about the Collector's edition disc first. I see a lot of people exploding at the mouth, ears, nose and overall body cavity when railing on this film. Many of the comments are that the flight scenes are not realistic because of CG and impossible capabilities of the airplane. I find this funny because in the special edition it shows how they had stunt pilots do these very things and have it all recorded. The construction of the Zeppelin was also interesting and yet debunks another myth that it was a 100% CG creation. Last but not least they do show a history of the real Escadrille and amazingly despite all the exploding heads, I found that it seemed to be far more accurate than some people are claiming when accusing it of being false.Overall the story is good for representing dog fights and training exercises, and although I didn't feel moved by every character's story, I still feel it had enough different things going on to make it good. The romance was a nice touch and when Lucienne (Jennifer Decker) is hiding from the Germans in the house it was very scary, especially thinking moments like that really happened back then. I also really liked the fact that they showed some ground battle and portrayed the trenches and the soldiers who fought in them. Many don't realize how many fought and died right there in the trenches, because if a bullet or bayonet did not get you, the mustard gas did. The team of men do start out somewhat as misfits and spoiled brats but then are shown to come together in their training and off base hanging out time to become a team. It is not the greatest portrayal of WWI nor is it the most accurate, but the story I thought was very moving and it is close enough to representing some of the men that I liked it. Eugene Skinner was one of my favorite people and Abdul Salis did a great job playing this role. James Franco and Jean Reno also are great in their roles. Franco is not everyone's favorite male actor but he seems much better than if they were to put Colin Farrel in there.",

    "review/text": "FLYBOYS is a pleasure to watch - going back into World War I history that deals with actual events yet takes the time to introduce unforgettable characters and romantic situations while giving the viewer a spectacular view of the first flying fighter planes. Yes, it has its flaws in technical lines, but it has a strong, committed cast and a storyline that flows seamlessly to the end.Tony Bill uses his resources from his countless cinematic experiences in adapting a story by Blake T. Evans (screenplay by Phil Sears, David S. Ward, and Evans) to recreate the legendary Lafayette Escadrille, a disparate group of young Americans who volunteered for the French military to become the country's first fighter pilots before the USA entered World War I. He manages to find the world atmosphere during the Great War, a time when young American boys who had no chance for significance in the tough times USA to go 'over there' to fight the Germans. He begins with the lad Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) who has just lost his family's farm to the bank, with William Jensen (Philip Winchester) who must live up to his family's fame as heroes, with Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) whose father sees him as a complete loss to his wealthy gentrified family, with Eddie Beagle (David Ellison) who leaves for war with his sweetheart's picture against his breast, with frustrated black fighter Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis) - a crew of boys who become bonded through the efforts of the French Captain Thenault (Jean Reno) and the loner flyer Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson).Planes are designed, the boys are rigorously trained, and off they go to missions never before flown, missions that waste some, and make heroes of others. Along the way Rawlings meets Lucienne (Jennifer Decker), a French girl who speaks no English but whose heart emboldens Rawlings to feats of heroism.The fighting scenes are terrific to watch as they seem to be done with toys, so light are the aircraft that started flying fighters. Yes, there are problems in depicting these missions because there are no stunt men who would dare fly such machines even for a movie. But Tony Bill keeps our attnetion with his direction and with the aerial cinematography of Henry Braham. The costumes are excellent and the musical score by Trevor Rabin recalls the period well. James Franco and his fellow actors offer solid performances. This is a bit of the past that is well to re-examine: FLYBOYS provides an evening of nostalgia and a fine story though at 140 minutes it could have been edited). Grady Harp, February 07",

    "review/text": "\"The first WWI aviation film in 40 years\", so director Tony Bill reported gloats in a recent interview. Actually, \"30\" would present a more accurate figure, considering the 1976 release of the JAck Gold's \"Aces High\", but no bother. I needn't fret about Bill's lack of affinity for cinematic history; his readily apparent ineptitude in both the historical and technical departments is bad enough.Talk about ineptitude (among other things), this supposed homage to an actual WWI squadron perpetuates just about every conceivable clich&eacute; imaginable, furthermore effectively stealing elements from nearly every aviation flick ever devised, including Blue Max, the Dawn Patrol, Dark Blue World, the Tuskegee Airmen, and even that age-old silent flick from 1927, WINGS. Furtherome, the battle scenes themselves reflect the most cheesy elements of propaganda war flicks, culminating in the endless ranks of snarling villains, the cheering crowds on the ground below as our heroes intercept the strafing Huns to save the day, and even a veritable race against the proverbial clock to destroy a German airship before it supposedly \"obliterates\" the entirety of Paris.And as of the various manners in which this film blatantly exhibits its readily apparent lack of prowess for historical and technical accuracies, let me count the ways.For starters, let's consider the countless manners in which the on-screen aircraft repeatedly defy the laws physics. Admittedly, some reviewers have pointed out Tony Bill's part-time profession as an aerobatic pilot, which in essence appears to compromised his interpretations of World War I combat, as he seems to have derived his perception of first world war fighters from having logged too many hours in Pitts Special as opposed to having derived genuine insight into the performance capabilities and limitations of such elaborate contusions of fabric and wood. For one thing, the aircraft exhibit speeds twice in excess that of the actual performance capabilities of World War I aircraft, culminating in a host of physical implausibilities as overly efficient climbing characteristics as if instigated in the absence of a stall barrier, low-level maneuvers that would have invariably either stalled the aircraft or resulted in considerable wing shear, not to mention that these biplanes and Triplanes exhibit phenomenal roll-rates which no multi-winged aircraft on the planet could possibly emulate. Evidently, Tony Bill exhibits an accurate conception of three dimensional space, but not of the actual performance characteristics of First World War-era fighters.Furthermore, the movie's glaring affinity for historical inaccuracy reflects the presence of numerous aircraft that never existed during the Escardrille's 1916 escapades, including the SE.5, Handley Page 400, Gotha IV, and of course the Fokker Dr. 1 Triplane, which brings me to another issue that drives me out of my mind, culminating in one of the most trivial misinterpretations about World War I aviation. Bottom line, the above depiction stems from a trivial and widespread popular misconception that by default associates World War One German aircraft with countless formations of red-coated Triplanes, as if the Germans had somehow managed to perpetuate endless clones of Von Richtofen, to say nothing about the fact that the Fokker Dr. 1 was ultimately produced in insignificant numbers, culminating in an actual production run of only 160 examples.In fact, the Lafayette Escabdrille fought the majority of its pitched-battles against outmoded Fokker E.III Eindeckers and two-seat Albatross and Aviatik observation scouts, the superior equipment of the Amercans frequently offset by their readily apparent lack of experience.And another thing, the average life expectancy of a World War I pilot is actually confined to the space of a single week, unlike the film's more optimistic projection of 3 to 6. Furthermore, somebody should remind the screenwriters never to emphasizes the virtues of German aircraft by citing the presence of all powerful engines, as the rates of horsepower which the Germans managed to conceive lagged considerably behind that of their allied counterparts.Furthermore, pilots were indeed NOT permitted to instill their own personal insignias, considering that, unlike World War II, rarely were aircrew assigned individual aircraft, often dispersing their ranks among the types available in a manner that typically resulted sharing planes out amongst each other. Furthermore, as blatantly misrepresnted by the closing scene, there is simply no such thing as rejoining one's formation in the event of finalizing an aerial skirmish, as aircraft frequently fought pitched battles at length, scattering miles away from each other, thus relaying each pilot with the burden of utilizing landmarks and navigations skills as the sole means for finding their way home on an individual basis.Reverting to the film's one and only redeeming feature, the various aspects in which the Flyboys attempts to model battle damage in conjunction with the various behaviors of shedding wings and burning engines bear a more accurate depiction than the remainder of the film. However, given the all too elaborate staging of such sequences through an over use of Green Screen techninques in conjunction with an overabundance of CGI effectively renders the overall appearance as reminiscent of, as one reviewer stated \"playing a really cool video game\" as opposed to providing a genuine \"in the cockpit\" sensation for the expreiences of piloting such frail machinations.Most offensive, however, is the gratuitous manner in which the movie concocts the entire spectacle within a fanciful dressing of glamour, all the while pedaling it's pretensions for historical and physical accuracy.In all fairness, perhaps I should lend Tony Bill an additional bone by citing the best moment of the entire movie, in which the guts of that blabbering Christian fanatic splatters the entirety of his instrument panel (the only moment in the entire film in which I cheered).Ultimately, the inclusion of a photograph of the actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille seems like a cruel joke, as if the preceding spectacle of cartoonish escapism somehow culminates in an authentic tribute to the squadron in question.Considering the shear sparsity of world war one related aviation flicks, it doesn't take a genius to brand this endeavor as by far the worst ever conceived.For more informative and productive viewing, I can recommend virtually every other aviation flick on the market, from the veritable classics like \"Blue Max\" and \"Aces High\" , to some of the more lukewarm efforts of \"Ace of Aces\" and \"Von Richtofen and Brown\".",

I don't know who green-lights these terrible movies, especially considering that this movie was NOT cheap, but if I continuously made blunders like this at work, i guarantee i'd be living in a trash dumpster. Although based on actual events (in that this unit did, in fact exist, but any similarities end there) and a mediocre book, the story, as it is presented in the movie, is awful - the fight scenes are ludicrous, laughable, and utterly unrealistic - and the acting is... i'm getting sick just thinking about it. How? How do these terrible actors get jobs?!? All things considered, however, the final responsibility falls on the director and, were I his boss, I'd have him beaten and dumped in a river somewhere. It's hard to express just how bad this movie is and I would actually recommend it soley based on the fact that it will give you and your friends something to criticize at length. Oh, this movie... my cat has left better things in the cat box.",

When viewing the movie you cant find fault with the acting. Everyone does a good job. The plot and writing arent perfect but get the point across. The bond between the men as they battle together works well. The romance though is the key here for me. We have two people that speak different languages and they fall in love. Its the heart of the movie in my opinion. The action is great, though I could argue that the dogfighting is too short. You just get the blood pumping and that particular fight ends too soon. The battles could have been longer but they are well executed. Very good movie!!!",

If you were to dive as steeply as they did in that film for as long as they did in a Nieuport 17 you would rip the lower wing clean off. Probably the same with the Fokkers. If you want more realistic combat scenes I would recomend The Blue Max but this movie will still keep you on the edge of your seat. One think I didn't like was the fact that they made the Germans look really bad. I've read many accounts of German pilots who really went out of their way to be humane and a many stories of allied pilots who were downright cruel (Mannock). WWI was a war where niether side was better than the other, and it was a war that shouldn't have happened. Entangling alliances are an itch.",

    "review/summary": "A Fine Movie, but Flawed",
    "review/text": "The movie captured the excitement one would expect in such a film, but I found the historical innacuracies concerning the pilots to be annoying. When America entered the war, they dissovled and absorbed this squadron. The black pilot was not allowed to fly because he was black. England was his adopted country and after the war he retired to Harlem where he died in poverty and relative obscurity. It is a tragic story. Also, if the \"hero\" really loved that girl, wouldn't he try to find her after the war? If you're going to make up a love story because you think it is required in a war movie, then at least give it a satisfying ending. Finally, in the beginning, when they are going to destroy the munitions factory, they are not escorting any bombers. How were they going to destroy it? In the end, when they went back, they were escorting bombers.I am not as schooled in planes as some other reviewers, but I do not think that bombers could automatically drop bombs at this point in the war. I believe they were still throwing them over the side of the plane. I could be wrong, but I found the technology featured in the movie to be a little advanced for the time period.Still, the dogfights and all aerial scenes were beautifully filmed and very exciting. I was enthralled in the story.If you do some research, you can tell which movie pilot was meant to represent which real pilot. There was a real pilot who memorized the eye chart so he would pass the test and be able to fly, and he was also partially deaf. The pilot in the movie who loses his hand represents him. The leader, who was a French-born American and who spoke with a French accent was represented by the brooding, dark-haired leader of the movie. The real stories of these men are actually more interesting than the movie version, but they fictionalized the stories of the pilots so they could combine some personalities and so they could give all of them that lived until the end of the movie a happy ending. Are Americans really that shallow that they would rather have a happy ending than know the truth? I don't think so. I think the movie would have been better had they told the real story of these pilots.My criticisms are why I only gave it four stars. I did enjoy it and the theater was full of old people like me so there was not one cell phone open or going off any time during the movie and no children running up and down the aisles. That was a nice change.",

    "review/text": "This movie is a very enjoyable movie. With a lot of clever flight action and tactics. For present day standards, it is actually fairly clean. So it can be suitable for family viewing, provided the kids are a little older. The plot centers around a group of American mercenary pilots in France during World War I, prior to the U.S.' entry into the war. They all come from different backgrounds and they all have different hopes and dreams. And before the movies ends you'll find yourself really liking every one of them. James Franco portrays the leader of the group and he comes across as likeable. Perhaps a little not quite Texan enough looking, but likeable nonetheless. And the love story between him and an orphaned French girl is a very sweet one. The main flaw I found in the movie is that the dialogue was unusually soft while the background music is unusually loud. Which made it to where at times I found myself reading the subtitles in order to fully understand the plot. (And I'm not hard of hearing!) However, that flaw is well overcome by the plot and the nice characters. I heartily recommend this movie.",

Along the way, the viewer is also asked to accept a romantic subplot that is thrown in for -- well, why was it thrown in? To influence female viewers? To flesh the protagonist out? Who can tell?Regardless, the aerial scenes are breathtaking, and more than overcome whatever limitations there are in the plot. In a world where fighter \"jocks\" can kill or be killed from 40 miles away, it is awesome to trace the roots and see a time when men flew in machines made of wood and canvas, and could look one another in the eye.",

    "review/text": "This film claims that it is based on historical fact, the only historical fact that it can claim is that world war 1 did indeed take place, and that there was a Lafayette escadrille. Hollywood does not understand guys, real warriors. Instead it takes a bite out of the moody warrior, the liar, preacher ect, but fails to show the spirit, the fear, and reality of young men going into battle. The poor attempts to show young pilots preparing to go to war, shows very little of flying, The gunge ho spirit these young men had, just a blase attempt to get 20 minutes of film shot, although there are several amusing spots, your left feeling lost, after 20 minutes you are waiting for something, anything to happen. Add to this poorly written love story that takes up a third of the movie. If you are able to watch the entire film you are left with the image that the pilots of ww1 flew perhaps once a week, spent the rest of the time feeling sorry for themselves, chasing after a long lost Love, our, drinking themselves to death. Poor script, poor computer graphics, horrible attention to historical fact make one wish that it had crashed and burned on the editors table.",

Fly Boys sticks more closely to the air combat theme, while still allowing for a human side to the story, and those combat scenes! They are great.Not wishing to give the story line away to anyone lucky enough to still be looking forward to seeing this film for the first time, I won't go into any details, but you will not be disappointed.In particular, the always good Jean Reno as Captain Thenault, Jennifer Decker as Lucienne, and James Franco as Blaine Rawlings were outstanding. My feeling is that this is Jean Reno's best fit in a role since Ronin. And he has been plenty good in several films since then.",

    "review/text": "First I like to address the controversy sustained by various reviewers of this film about accuracy or inaccuracy of historical events.As usually occurs when Hollywood's products states \"based on historical or true facts\" viewers should take the statement as \"very loosely based on historical or true facts\", such is the case here. So do not get annoyed when lots of tri-planes shows up or a zeppelin intends to bomb Paris, those are the usual \"historical licenses\" of this kind of films.I regard this movie as an \"action film\" as for example \"Indiana Jones\" or \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" and as such is quite good.\"Flyboys\" (2006) was directed by multifaceted Tony Bill who is also actor and producer of many films.The story is based on the ventures of young Americans volunteers to become pilots of Lafayette Escadrille. From all over the States with different motivations they go to France without even knowing a French word.There they are trained and launched, still green, into the fry suffering losses and evolving step by step into veteran and even aces.I love the special effects now possible with CGI, crowds of planes may be shown, fighting each other fiercely and giving the word \"action\" a full new meaning.Play acting is correct, with only Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault over par, beautiful French actress Jennifer Decker as Lucienne give way to romance.The runtime, 140 minutes, is a little excessive.A good movie for a variety of audiences: WWI buffs, action movie's fan, romance fans.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",

In case you haven't heard anything about the movie, it is about some gutsy American pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille fighting for the French during WWI prior to America's entry into the war. Some good news for all of you married guys out there...my wife can't stand war flicks (yes, I dragged her in anyway LOL), but she really enjoyed this one. There is enough romance in the movie to keep the women happy, but not so much as to make their male counterparts gag. The dogfighting scenes are amazing. It is the first time I've seen a movie where the digital effects and standard film are seemless. I really couldn't tell the difference! The extras are worth the purchase. They explain the true story of the pilots, which were just as crazy as the characters portrayed by the actors. These guys flew planes that broke up in hard maneuvers without parachutes, and one other thing...pet lions. Yeah, I said pet lions. These guys really were crazy!The only reason that I gave this movie four stars instead of five is because of some historical faux-pas any aero dilettante would notice, and James Franco's metro-blond highlights in a early 20th century setting. Other than that, sit down and enjoy the ride!",

    "review/summary": "A bland romance with some flying action thrown in",
    "review/text": "\"Flyboys\" pretends to be the 21st century version of the first Academy Award winner for best picture,Wings (1927). There are a lot of similarities in the film -- both feature American boys going off to France in World War I as aerial aces; both films have lengthy romantic interludes; and both feature pretty good air action scenes in dogfights with Germans.Yet it is, ironically, the older film that is more authentic, more fun, has better flying scenes, and has better music than its newer mate. \"Wings\", which was among Gary Cooper's first films, is more naive in its \"script\" (it's a silent film) but far more realistic and exciting in its all-important aerial scenes.What \"Flyboys\" does with aerial excitement is pretty typical and bland by 21st century standards. Most of the scenes are computer-generated and feature things that could not possibly happen mixed with a perfection that obviously wasn't the case in 1918, when the United States officially entered the war.In one instance, an American flyboy -- being tailed by a German -- lets off the throttle, the plane goes backward, and his stationary wheels rip through the upper fuselage of the German plane, knocking it out of air. Sure, that could happen, uh huh.Both films features lengthy and boring love scenes but, again, the older movie has the better stuff. The love scenes between Buddy Rogers and his female star in \"Wings\" is more authentic, more interesting and, frankly, more realistic than the nonsense that goes on being American flyboys and French girls that don't even speak the same language.Still, this movie is good for an evening's entertainment but people around here giving it five stars and saying it's great apparently have never seen another film. This movie has long, long boring sequences between the action and it goes on far too long. At almost 130 minutes, this movie is at least 30 minutes too long. It could have been edited compactly to fit a 95-minute span that would have left viewers fresh and involved. As it is, it overstays its welcome by at least a half-hour.If you are thinking of renting or buying \"Flyboys\", do yourself a favor and watch \"Wings\" from 1927 instead. That movie has the best World War I air sequences ever filmed and, by comparison with \"Flyboys\", is still exceptionally relevant in 2008.",

I would say the film is guilty as charged in those areas, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fun movie to watch and enjoy.I love the early years of aviation, the old style dog fighting in bi-planes and the like, so I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to go see Flyboys on the big screen. While not the greatest film, it was worth the price of admission and was filled with enough aircraft acrobatics to be great fun.Thankfully this disc comes with some interesting extras in the special features that help raise the value when considering a purchase. Personal recommendation, watch for sales on this title and get a copy of this film at a bargain price. While I find it fun and worth owning in my library, the MSRP is a bit on the higher side for this title, so you may wish to wait for a nice sale to grab your copy.",

However it really drew me in with the excellent music, wonderful flying sequences and interesting story lines. Good acting! The color and the particular shade of the blue Escadrille uniforms are/is (can't decide) very pleasing to the eye. Of course, the truth is that I looked at the producer's and director's commentary first to find out how they did their flying and other tricks. I like to know what those making the film tried to do and whether or not they feel they reached their goals.I don't know how many women will care for it, but I hope they'll try it because not only is action emphasized in the movie, but feelings as well. The characters were developed using the feats and experiences of several members of the Escadrille. It is entertainment, yet everyone connected with the movie has taken care to be as historically accurate as possible. Some reviewers have referred to the number of cliches in the film, but are events cliches if they have a basis in fact? If \"cliche\" facts are not included, does that not take us even further from the truth?",

They had aircraft doing things that are impossible to do in real life. It was very obvious throughout the movie also. To make matters worse, the special effects showed curly smoke trails following each bullet as they were fired. The bullet impacts in the fabric covering of the airplanes didn't make round holes with the edges curved inwards, but rather made triangular and squarish shaped holes that blew through from the inside out.This movie ends up being very much like watching a video game instead of transporting the viewer into the timeframe of the era. A movie that is believable is an enjoyable movie to watch and therefore becomes real entertainment. Flyboys was neither and was a waste of time and money.",

I was looking to showcase a new Blu-ray player on my 60\" Sony XBR, and as I am a big fan of most military movies, I thought I'd give it a shot.Boy, I really wish I had spent my money elsewhere. The acting was incredibly poor across the board - I'm usually a fan of Jean Reno, but lets face it - he has his genre (Ronin as an example), and this is most definitely not it. The script seemed almost amateur at times, and throughout the whole film I found myself wishing I could find a way to attach myself to atleast one of the characters so as to better enjoy it... alas, no such luck. There seemed to be very little character development, and what little there was, felt rushed. The romance was poorly executed, and as beautiful as Lucienne (Jennifer Decker) is, I'm afraid it couldn't save me from wishing that I were somewhere else throughout the whole film.The film's one saving grace was on the technical side. The transfer was very good to excellent, with crisp, bright colors, and deep blacks throughout, and the audio - while not great by any respect, certainly wasnt terrible either. Unfortunately, most of the CGI was right about what you'd expect from a B-grade movie, and it was readily aparent in some scenes that the planes were... well, not actually planes.In short, unless you are a die-hard aviation buff, and are willing to overlook the film's many faults, I would suggest passing on this one - it might make for a decent rental but little more.",

Even the romance was so well done it doesn't burden the movie down, but helps uplift it. This one is up there with those like \"The Blue Max\". I highly recommend it.

    "review/text": "This is an underappreciated film. Its based on composite characters and the exploits of the Lafayette Escadrille (Lafayette Squadron) of the fledgling French Air Force in the trench warfare days of WW I prior to the US joining the effort. In the days before reliable combat aircraft, no parachutes, no aircraft radios, and next to no instruments, flying by \"the seat of one's pants\" was the norm. Low level, low speed flying gets plenty fast when you are only 300 feet off the ground in a dogfight! The CGI graphics are, overall, excelllent, at least by today's standards, with computer's doing a passable job of demonstrating the various flight characteristics of the various aircraft (fighters, bombers, and zeppalins) of the day, including crews crawling out on the wings to service engines during a mission!This film, and the historical information on the bonus DVD, does a good job in not only demonstrating the world of aviation in WW I, but also in appealing to viewers who enjoy good historical fiction. As with \"Memphis Belle,\" all the various events in the movie actually occured (or something very much like them), though perhaps with a bit of \"Hollywood\" thrown in for romance, time constraints, etc.",

    "review/text": "As a drama, this film lacks a lot. The characters almost have depth, almost. The romance almost has depth, almost. The film almost has facts, almost. There is a lot of almost in this film, which is this movie's primary problem.The story is quite straightforward. A group of hot-blooded young lads head for France during The Great War to fly airplanes against Germany. One of the future pilots takes the Aquitania to Europe, which had to have been a bit of a challenge since the Aquitania was not in civilian service at the time.Once in France, the excitement builds as the young pilots fly against Fokker Triplanes, even though those planes did not enter the war until later, and then only in small numbers. The Fokker was notorious for being slow and occasionally falling apart because of a variety of problems. However, the Fokker had an excellent climb rate and was maneuverable. Baron Von Richthofen's plane was one of the few painted completely red. I understand that the choice of red was made to help tell the good guys from the bad guys.Skipping past all the historical inaccuracies, which this film boasts in abundance, the movie finally gets into two stories. There is a shallow love story and the dog fights. The love story is shallow because our two love birds have to develop this love story in between dog fights and the love story seemed to me to be a distraction to the rest of the story.The real heart of this movie is the dog fights. Boasting hundreds of CGI effects, this movie is a video game. Planes roar and fly with awesome-looking bullet effects. The zeppelin is a masterpiece, and one of the scenes on the zeppelin is a reprise of a similar scene used at least once, in the movie \"The Rocketeer.\" I do not have sufficient knowledge of the aircraft used in World War I to know whether they could turn as well as the aircraft shown in this movie, but the turns did seem too tight to me, especially for the Fokker with its wing structural issues.So we get to see a series of scenes where the good guys and the bad guys fight each other in the skies over France. The good guys lose pilots and shoot down the bad guys, and the good guys are on the side of right and eventually they must have to gain some kind of moral victory.The biggest problem with this movie is lack of story. The backgrounds of the various characters and the nominal love story are merely doorways to get these characters into dogfights. I have seen this movie compared to \"Top Gun,\" but though that movie had its own issues, the dogfight scenes were secondary to the conflicted character that Tom Cruise played. In this movie the dogfights are the entire reason for the movie, and everything else is secondary.On the other hand, the dogfight scenes are a blast to watch. If you have ever liked video games, especially flight simulator type games or war games, this movie brings those games to life. The special effects used to show the planes are phenomenal. The special effects provide the redeeming qualities of this movie and save it from being a two-star movie.Other reviews of this movie are quite polarized. However, the reason for the polarization is obvious. If you expect even a nominal attempt at accuracy, then this movie will likely be disappointing for you to watch. If you want to watch a movie about that is vaguely inspired by World War I dogfights and can wait for the movie to start showing them, then you will likely enjoy this movie.Good Luck!",

    "review/text": "I saw this in the theater and couldn't wait to get it on dvd. I couldn't believe such a great movie got such ho-hum treatment by the critics, but as usual, what do they know. I'd rate this the 2nd all-time best war movie, after Private Ryan. (With Enemy at the Gates #3). I am so glad they make movies like this, to educate people about long-forgotten times. It has everything, action packed scenes, Americans volunteering to go in harm's way - once again in France. The Lafayette Escadrille was a volunteer group of American aviators, similar to the Flying Tigers in WW2 - the AVG (American Volunteer Group). This is WWI, and it follows their adventures and combat, they are trained by the French, and fly their planes into the teeth of combat with Germany's best. I was amazed at the accuracy of many details, like the German infantry's uniforms, and correct rifles, and the use of the lozenge camoflage on the German bombers - all correct. I love it when war movies get it right. And this one has some super action scenes that will take your breath away as you hang there in the sky with the flyboys with not much more than canvas and string for wings and a single-blade wooden prop, it is so harrowing and uplifting to see. Talk about entertainment. I absolutely love this movie and am proud to own it. This was by far the best movie of 2006. It seems impossible that it is such a well-kept secret.",

    "review/text": "Flyboys is a film about American volunteer aviators during the first World War before America declared war on Germany in April 1917. The movie is action packed and exciting as far as the special effects. Hollywood is long over do for a Good WWI aviation film and this is an area where I would like to see more movies about considering WWI Aviation is my hobby.Hollywood does a descent job with historical accuracy however I did find some errors in it. But if you are looking for a good film to watch for excitement and adventure then this is a good pick. If you don't care about historical accuracies, stopreading now. :-)Some of the historical inaccuracies I found were: 1) The French Neuport 17 biplanes had rotory engines, not radial engines. Rotory engines were round like radials but spun on the camshaft with the propeller. I believe the Neuports used a 80 horse power Le Rhone engine. The rotory engines in early and mid WWI had two speeds, on and off. 2) The German Fokker DR1 triplanes did not enter the war until August of 1917 when the Flyboys would have been flying SPAD VII. The movie should have depicted either Halberstadt DII or Albatros DII and DIII. Fokker Eindeckers (monoplanes) were near the end of thier life span in mid to late 1916 when this story is depicted. 3) Maneuvers pulled by the fragile Neuports depicted in the film would have ripped the upper wings off which was a weakness of the Neuport series, especially pulling out of deep dives. 4) Not every German Fokker DR1 was all red. Manfred von Richtofen, the Red Baron flew an all red fokker DR1 and was killed in one but even the Red Baron fly non-all red triplanes from time to time. Although squadrons usually keep to the squadrons markings some German pilots of certain rank and/or number of kills could mark their planes with their own personal markings. 5) The straight (latin) cross on the German Fokkers did not come to being until March 1918, long after the dis-banning of the Lafayette Escadrille. 6) Where is there mention of Raoul Lufbery and William Thaw two of America's first aces and early members of the Escadrille? 7) From my research I have not found where the Lafayette Escadrille brought down a German Zepplin....I'll keep researching.But again as a film to watch for action, Flyboys meets the bill. And as mentioned in other reviews Hollywood did get some things right histoical.",

    "review/text": "What Flyboys is not is a documentary. I can see that pains a lot of people reviewing it, because they didn't have those planes that year, or they didn't fire that ammo that year, or the planes are the wrong color, or zeppelins didn't bomb in the daytime. What. Ever. Go rent a documentary or read a history book if that's what you seek. This movie was BASED on a true story, and did not claim to be factual in every way.Flyboys was a story about people with nothing to lose. For the most part, they came from various trials in life back in the States that seemed hopeless for them, and they were committed to making a meaningful contribution in the great war, regardless of the risk to their own lives. (just like the fine men and women in our military today). They must overcome cultural, racial and national prejudices to do so.This is the first movie I've watched in some time which cast the French in a positive light. It reminded me that they were once a brave nation that stood to fight against those that would overrun them. I thoroughly enjoyed Jean Reno as French Capt. Thenault of the Lafayette Escadrille. Although the script nods to the French disdain for Americans, it's not long before we see Thenault's compassion, love and admiration for the yankee expats who have come to die for his country and cause.This film both condemns and glamorizes war. We see front-line battle, the death of civilians, the destruction of beautiful historical buildings, the struggle with killing, the admiration of a skilled enemy and both honor and disgrace in battle. There are also the thrills of victory, however small, bitterness of loss and defeat, and hope for the future.It is laced with a love story made to feel genuine by the lack of common language. That love goes surprisingly unfulfilled at the end, as was surely the case uncountable times in the Euro wars (or any for that matter).There are no big name actors to suck the air from the film, so it is an opportunity to enjoy some fresh faces and performances. One of my favorites was Michael Jibson as Porter, flying into battle singing \"Onward Christian Soldiers\". It was funny because the Germans could hear him as he was doing battle with them. Jennifer Decker as Lucienne was WOW good-looking. And when she was injured, she was made to look so, instead of glam wounded. Gunnar Winbergh played the evil German ace Black Falcon, and without a word of dialog he makes us hate every molecule of his being.Bottom line, this was a fun flick. I watched it twice in one weekend. If you're so into WW1 artifacts and minutia re-creationism that it means everything, I feel sorry for you that you would let it spoil your enjoyment of Flyboys.",

( One with honor, one without.)Only viewed as they went about their business of killing.This, I really appreciated.I used to work on biplanes and I really enjoyed all of the flying scenes.I never saw a plane do what it couldn't.And the decision to make each flying scene show that the Americans had learned more about how to survive a dogfight was a great touch, something i have never seen in a war movie before.The plot plan to aim the final fight between the young american and the seasoned german ace-hole was very well done.The cgi was, in my opinion, just fine. I watched the movie again with the commentary on and was surprised at many of the revelations about what was real and what wasn't.I do disagree with everyone in Hollywood who thinks that a war movie needs a love story to be successful.I don't care if the box office agrees with them.This is definitely the best WW1 war flick of this century.(Remember, I remember the last century.)",

That kind of anticipation can swing both ways, setting one up for either a great film viewing experience of a real let-down. Flyboys kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. If you are concerned with the technical details of aircraft, insignia and flying techniques, then just relax, please! This is a entertainment, not a didactic examination of aerial combat. There was one comment about \"physics\" and aviation here. One must remember that Bill needs to appeal to the audience of 2006, most of whom who have seen airships move through space and time in the blink of an eye cinematically, and who have traveled on commercial aircraft, if not experienced ski-jets, ninja bikes and ultra-fast rollercoater rides. So, how do you make aircraft that travel along at barely over 100 mph look exciting on the screeen. Perhaps a little poetic license is to be permitted, no? If the acting was less then stellar, I didn't seem to notice. I cared about the characters. I wanted them to succeed and survive. Sure, there were cliches in abundance, but I didn't mind. There are cliches in just about every action film I've seen in the last decade.And the love story was touching and kept the film from being a stringing together of combat sequences (which, incidently, were stunning).I came to this picture with a bit of a bias as I love reading and learning about combat aircraft of the two world wars. Flyboys was exactly the type of film I was looking forward to seeing. It embraces a time when air combat was still almost hand to hand, and could be face to face.There is a certain existentialism about the short lives these men led and yet they wouldn't have made their choices differently.I am grateful to the producers and all involved in making a film that is the noble aspects of human beings, as opposed to making entertainment about people doing \"dumb\" things or mountains of ironic statements.",

The racial prejudices, the coveted revenge of a spiritually man wounded for having lost his old partners, the spiritual growing up of another one and the heroic disinterestedness of a Texan boy who have nothing to lose in this conflict because he has no family, a loser from of his own country who finds a motive to demonstrate himself and his country he is much more a simple inheritor of a farm, vanished by legal reasons.But the highlight of this movie are undeniably, the spectacular aerial sequences, plenty of adrenaline and mercurial vitality.

    "review/text": "'Flyboys' is a great epic movie. It zeros in on a group of American World War I flying aces, volunteering before President Wilson reluctantly brought U.S. involvement into the war. Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) is the main protagonist. Born and bred as a cowboy in Texas, he volunteers for the bravado of adventure. He is joined by a wealthy American; an African-American who has expatriated to Paris as a boxer (and volunteered to fight wanting to escape both boxing and America); a pure-bred Bible Christian with a mission; a failed ex-con, fleeing the country; and an American trying to keep the family military lineage going. They join up with a French flying unit and are under the wing of an arrogant and wary American pilot residing at a mansion sized estate and their French commander, Capt. Thenault. Their mission proves to be more daunting than their initial cockiness calls them to be, but they soon learn and develop pilot and combat skills.The movie contains some dizzying airborne scenes that surpass post-modern expectations. (If this movie isn't playing at the I-Max, then it should be. Afterall, it would be a missed opportunity on the part of both the purveyor and the audience.) Besides a compelling plot (which is based on a true story, afterall) there's good comraderie and a romance added well to the mix. The former provides some well-developed complications and entertainment. For the romance, the innocent balcony-type scenes couldn't possibly offend anyone. If there seems to be a distance between Rawlings and his French girl, Lucianne (Jennifer Decker), it's because of a language barrier (something quite natural, for crying out loud!) But if love is a language, then there is a connection that surpasses the lack of dialogue. There aren't going to be any prizes awarded for the acting, but Franco is likable enough as the swaggering Rawlings, and the rest of the cast provide engaging performances, nevertheless. The tension and resentment based on class, experience, arrogance, and race is certainly given a believable treatment. How they can cover all of the bases, clock in without becoming tedious, mix it all up without becoming jarring, and provide an uplifting experience amongst the war and strife is a major achievement.Not to be too reactionary, but there's something to be said about the criticism of 'Flyboys'. To some it will seem like a cornball adventure. First, one must divide the worthy corn from the shmaltzy. This film works. (To be fair, critics do honor corny movies, but no one dies in 'Hoosiers' or 'Field of Dreams'.) Perhaps this movie makes some people uncomfortable because it does honor bravery in battle, chivalry, and comraderie. ('Flyboys' does contain some inspiring, but dated little pep talks that may inspire the \"cliche'\" label.) It may glorify the war experience, but it certainly doesn't hedge about the horrors. Wisely, almost expertly, they glide over the atrocities of war in a way that is both unvarnished, but not enough to entirely gross out the audience. Nothing is swept under the rug. As the new volunteers pass by casualties on a train platform, they find plenty of war's realities. (And, so does the audience.) I also believe that there may be less enthusiasm for 'Flyboys' because the German army presented has almost a generation remaining before they become Nazis (even if the enemy is certainly presented with enough menace). I prefer movies that promote peace over war. But if there is to be war, movies like 'Flyboys' are inspiring works which showcase four flying aces that show courage, heart, and chivalry. 'Flyboys' is a great war movie that soars!",

The complaints about the poor script, one-dimensional characters, uneven pacing, flat acting, unbelievable CGI effects, almost total lack of historical accuracy, etc. are all justified. The producers, director and screenwriters really hit the mark with this one!If you're interested in WWI aviation movies, look for THE BLUE MAX, DAWN PATROL, WINGS, HELL'S ANGELS or even VON RICHTHOFEN AND BROWN. They're not all five-star efforts but they're all far better than FLYBOYS. Not recommended.",

    "review/text": "How can I sum up this movie: Low budget CGI, terrible acting, terrible lines, Clich&eacute; storyline, mediocre action, cheesy revolting love story, and untrue to life. I would have to say the best actor in the movie probably was the lion. Yes, there is a lion in a WWI movie, can you believe it?I found the dramatic dog fighting scenes actually quite comical. Once you realize the planes are CGI, the dogfights are almost as enjoyable as watching a PS3 game. The true horror of the film is watching the star of the show (Spiderman's best friend) try to woo a (almost retarded) French girl that likes to visit a local brothel for recreation. I had to vomit several times during their less than bearable dialogue. In one part of the movie, the leading character flies to her house to give her a joy ride in his plane. Yeah, I'm sure that happened all the time during a little war like WWI. Also, I swear the movie's soundtrack was used in about every other major blockbuster movie of the past, in an attempt to make the movie seem of a higher quality. I was actually relieved when the scratched blu-ray I rented locked up during the ending of the movie, so I wouldn't have to sit through much more of this pathetic excuse for a war movie.Questions to ask:Why was a French girl bandaging up injured war pilots in a brothel?How does a guy land a plane 100 yards next to his girlfriend's house with German guards all around without anyone noticing?How come they give a guy a medal rather than shooting him on site for stealing a squadron plane to save his retarded girlfriend?How do you chop off someone's hand with a dull field shovel?How is it that new pilots are suddenly artistic enough to paint professional looking logos on their planes?How can you shout commands at each other over the plane engines and wind noise during a dogfight?Why would you stand and wave your arms in open enemy territory after being shot down during a dogfight?Why would you do a solo suicide mission against a dozen nazi fighters, so you could revenge your friends?How do you do -3 G jet fighter maneuvers in a 65 Horsepower WWI plane?What was Bubba Gump's little brother doing in this movie?Why was there a pet lion used in a WWI movie? (believe it or not, this lion was based on a true story - too bad it didn't eat the main actors in this movie.. that would have been great to see.)",

The reviews suggested this could be a stinker, but as I am interested in aviation history and like watching airplanes I decided to view the movie. Parts of the story are a bit corny but the story of the training was quite good. Although much of the flying was special effects, it carried with it a feeling of accuracy. Some of the heroes die and as mentioned in the movie WWI flyers had a horrible life expectancy. Part of the reason was the fact that the planes were flimsy and parachutes by and large were not used. To those who complained that real airplanes were not used, you only have to follow aviation and note the number of \"warbirds\" flown by enthusiasts that have crashed with quite a few fatalities - even when flown by experts -- and these are much safer World War II and post-war planes. Making a movie like this is not worth endangering flyers' lives - cgi is good enough for me -- I do not feel cheated. It was a long movie but did not feel long. Great Zeppelin and bomber scenes were good watching. I really enjoyed FLYBOYS.",

    "review/text": "For starters, the plot of Flyboys is predictable from start to finish. Hot-shot American pilot joins French Escadrille, defies French veterans, romances local girl, becomes hero. Although the plot is completely unoriginal, the movie loses all credibility as soon as the action starts.There are plenty of reviews that tell how flawed this movie is from a historical perspective, so I won't get into that.The special effects that some reviewers called \"spectacular\" were cheap, tacky, unrealistic, and downright laughable. The most glaring example is during dogfights when the aircraft guns are fired. The smoke from the guns was shown traveling ahead of the aircraft, all the way to the enemy aircraft in fact. Smoke coming out of an aircraft flying at any speed would dissipate immediately to the rear. Even if there were tracer rounds back then (which there weren't), they wouldn't emit thick black smoke.Some storyline points were simply ridiculous.When one of the pilots crash lands, the hero lands his plane in crossfire of a trench battle on rocky, cratered ground littered with jagged pieces of metal to save him. This is ridiculous by itself. Then when he finds his buddy's hand trapped under the plane, he amputates it with one swing of a lightweight field shovel instead of simply lifting the plane off his hand (which he easily could have done with a cloth-covered aircraft).The hero repeatedly borrows his plane from the squadron to visit the local girl, without even a reprimand from the squadron commander. In one scene, German soldiers occupy the house with the woman and the children inside. At least one soldier is standing guard outside. The hero lands his plane a couple of hundred yards away, walks to the house, and rescues them, undetected by the Germans. Then when he starts his engine to leave, every head turns, alert to the engine sound. But of course they're too late to catch him.In one scene, just after the squadron lands from a dogfight, the hero decides to take off again by himself. Seconds later he is seen singlehandedly shooting up a line of German fighter planes, neatly parked in a row at an undefended airfield.I'm a small plane pilot, so I could go on about cloth-covered planes with 80-horsepower engines doing vertical climbs and jet-fighter maneuvers. But sadly, the realism was much worse in other ways.This movie was so badly done, I started fast forwarding half way through.",

Her most intimate memory of a man she loved was the warmth of his hand she felt through her gloved hand was similar to the courtship in this movie. For the sake of being a pilot and doing flight simulation with aircraft i'll never get to fly this is a time period movie i enjoyed as much since the film \"The Blue Max\" for the romance of flying has been a real treat to see the souls that pioneered in the Great War with aircraft that are agile as a ballerina but fragile as a butterfly when handled. This being maneovers that involve piroettes because of the slower speeds compared to jets that generally use a 5 mile turning radius. Jet fighters that are built to handle at least 10 times the weight in horizontal or vertical turns the World War I fighter could easily rip apart it's canvas fabric or wooden structure is shown in the flying sequences. The french Nieuport is very pleasing to the eye as the fine figure for a woman. The vertical tail looks as if the french flag was hung off the end with the corners edges rounded off just as also the german Fokker's horizontal tail is shaped like a falcon's is a treasure trove to visualize in this film. I greatly appreciation that the director took to explain and portray these men and flying machines during this era how they were both utilized.

The two young romantic leads are attractive enough, but let's face it - the real reason for seeing this movie is provided by the dogfights. And director Tony Bill does not disappoint: the sequences of aerial combat are as thrilling as any military action ever recreated on film. They are easy to follow because all the planes have very visible personal insigniae clearly identifying who's who.

It is nice to finally have a movie covering WWI a little. The bad is the bland lead actor, the terrible cliches(white guy doesn't like black guy until the life saving event, then changes his heart. The lead who learns to work with others, etc.) Seen those in a million pictures. So overall, it is a well shot movie with a story worth seeing, but a lack of strong acting and compelling script bring this one down.",

    "review/text": "Not an epic film, but it does what a movie is supposed to do: entertain you with drama, suspense, action, and a little humor. Like many here, I absolutely love history. I am also often disappointed when \"historic\" movies totally fumble historic facts. But I've given up on trying to get 100% accurate history from dramatic movies. I've got plenty of books that can give me that. I read some of the reviews here of those who know WWI better than me. I ABSOLUTELY respect them, but I can't help but feel that if these movies were made with the accuracy they demanded, a lot of the audience would be lost. I think the people who made this film care about history, but they can't afford to lose money. \"Gods and Generals,\" a huge box office flop, was a good example of real accuracy losing its audience.Three things I really appreciated about \"Flyboys:\"The role of Eugene Skinner, based on the real Euguene Jacques Bullard (who was from my father's hometown of Columbus, GA). Bullard was not technically in the Lafayette Escadrille, but it is so important to have him in the movie to communicate his story. Like the producers said, a lot of people will think he was a \"PC\" Hollywood creation. I hope the day comes soon when people will stop assuming these things.The role of Lyle Porter, or the cliche \"religious one.\" I don't know if he was based on one of the real pilots, but I'm glad they treated his Christianity with dignity and respect.And I really liked the scene where the pilots trained. When I watch it, I feel like I'm watching the birth of United States aviation as it happened back then. I feel like I'm watching history even if the participants don't realize the impact of what they were doing. Some of the bravest military men are the ones who sign up to go into battle with new, untried weapons.Read a book for the real story and the real facts. In the meantime, this is a decent film, well worth watching.",

I was a little pissed about how they painted the Dr.I triplanes. Red barron had a blood red triplane and all the rest were uasally green and red. I have seen color pictures of a black Dr.I but it was taken at least after WWII and did not have a falcon painted on the side. Of course there were different names for most of the pilots but that is in every war movie made for entertainment like the new Pearl Harbor(Where do you get Danny and Rafe from Taylor and Welsh). The thing that lost it's hand would not have flown again after being convicted of crime. I was glad to see a case of battle fatigue because Ive never seen that in a war movie rated PG-13. So if you are going to see an accurate war film look somewhere else like The Blue Max but if you want to be entertained see it.",

    "review/text": "Flyboys is the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille, an elite group of flyers during WWI that US citizens were allowed to join before America had formally entered the war. Much like the French Foreign Legion, it was made up of men who, for the most part, were running away from something or were out for adventure. One man in particular from Texas, Blaine Rawlings - played engagingly by James Franco (James Dean, Spiderman) - is particularly laid back about the whole affair, until he finds himself in his first dogfight. Then reality sets in and he realizes why the average life expectancy for these flyers is three to six weeks.Director Tony Bill (The Sting - producer) gives his film a traditional epic look with gorgeous cinematography, sweeping locations and authentic details, while also using CGI technology to good effect in the flying sequences. This film far surpasses The Aviator, which did little more than prepare the way for this more masterful handling of early military aviation and the dogfight sequences in particular. There are also some exciting rescue missions that have us on the edge of our seats, as well as the downing of a zeppelin that has set out to bomb Paris.Besides the action in the air and on the ground, there is a sweet love story between Franco's character, Rawlings, and a French country girl named Laura, played winsomely by Ruth Bradley. There are also some well-developed character studies among the rest of the pilots: a black boxer-turned-pilot, played by Abdul Salis; a Bible-reading Christian, played by Michael Jibson, who sings \"Onward Christian Soldiers\" as he goes in for a kill; a suspected spy, played by David Ellison; etc. Jean Reno does a terrific job as Captain Thenault, their instructor and commanding officer, as does Tyler Labine as head flyer Briggs, who keeps a lion as a pet.If there were one word I would use to describe the story and relationships in this film it would be \"grace.\" There are a lot of screw-ups along the way, but there always seems to be an attitude of grace among the participants. This brings the men together as a family, and gives the film a very godly quality. WWI fighter pilots had a harrowing job to do. If their planes caught fire, they had only three options: burn to death, jump and hope for the best (there were no parachutes) or kill themselves with a pistol. So, they were heroes of the first order. Giving the story plenty of grace helps to make it human and raise it above the typical action-adventure film.Though the film is rated PG-13 for war violence, it is handled with surprising good taste, and there is also a refreshing absence of sex and profanity, though there is a small amount of the latter. The DVD is almost absent of extra features, which is a shame. People who like reality, history, aviation and a good story will like this film. Those who want to escape reality into an artificial world of sensory overload, won't.Waitsel Smith",

    "review/text": "Looking through the past reviews of this film / DVD I am forced to wonder what film some other reviewers were watching. I cannot imagine anybody above the age of 20 finding this film either entertaining or convincing. I find it impossible to recommend anything about \"Flyboys\", except perhaps a couple of good performances to lighten up the absolute failure of its execution.Like the majority of people who chose to watch this film, I approached it because a) It was a war film and b) it was a film about air combat.However, neither of these parameters was satisfied, even minimally.Regarding its depiction of war, well you can forget it. Besides some truly strange \"history\" involving mythical German advances, none of the actual nods to WWI make any impact whatsoever. I was NEVER once convinced that the film makers had a clue about the period in which their story was set. There is no real sense of worry or despair throughout the film that accompanied the WWI pilots of real life. The Pretty boys of the Lafayette Escadrille don't share the same sense of \"not coming back\" as the RFC (Royal Flying Corps) pilots of \"Aces High\" or the Jasta pilots of \"The Blue Max\". I know the pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille were volunteers, but there is no doubt or cynicism regarding the war or a sense of nervousness or apprehension. In fact all the pilots seem somewhat happy to be there. They obviously weren't aware of the average lifespan of a WWI pilot or the fact that none of the major combatants allowed their pilots to use parachutes until the Germans introduced the practice in 1917. Being issued a pistol to shoot yourself in the head instead of being burned alive should have caused some raised eyebrows.The aerial sequences, which should have been the star of this film, are in a word `terrible'. There are more convincing effects, physics and graphics in most computer games these days than there are in \"Flyboys\". It's really a shame that the producers didn't get some physicians on board to point out that WWI aircraft were subject to real life limitations....and of course, every German aircraft was a Fokker DR1 triplane....and painted red.\"Flyboys\" also includes some of the usual clich&eacute;s of modern Hollywood war movies. There is the obligatory love interest and the obligatory black sacrifice, this time in the shape of Jennifer Decker and Abdul Salis.As the unlikely love of James Franco's lead character, Decker is just irritating. Their scenes are obviously there as a clumsy filler in between the flying scenes and they are a complete waste of time.Salis's character, presumably based on real life pilot Eugene Bullard (the only black pilot of WWI), is also extremely annoying. The idea of introducing a black pilot into the film should have been a good one (even if a little forced), but in \"Flyboys\" one gets the feeling that he is reduced to the level filling the ranks of the \"good guys\" simply as a PC device. I don't think there's anything mentioned regarding the difficulty Bullard faced in real life, or that he was barred from entry to a US squadron on racial grounds. It's very misleading and it's hard not to be cynical about it. A movie about Eugene Bullard proper would have been a great idea, but I doubt that will ever happen.The bottom line about \"Flyboys\" comes down to this, if you want to watch a colour film about flying in WWI, then watch \"The Blue Max\", \"Aces High\" or Roger Corman's \"Von Richthofen and Brown\". Even with the errors those films incorporate, they are still far, far ahead of the fiasco that is \"Flyboys\".",

The charicters and story touch your heart and you grow to love them as you see this film, however I have not purchased this film and CAN NOT recomend it because there is alot of negative content 1. Profanity is pretty rampent in this film. 2. Salaciousness is in there a bit when the main charicter gets hurt in a plane injury he wakes up in a prositution house- Luciane (The girl of the film) asks him to take off his pants, and at first he doesnt even seem to understand that its because hes hurt and she is trying to take care of him. 3. there is also a bit of violence in this film which I would have been able to overlook (As it is a war film) if not for the other negativity. 4. the last of my complaints are two scenes one where the pressure the so called Christian of the film to drink alcohol and he gives in and the second scene is when Cassidy dies and the general guy reads a letter he wrote 'in case of death' where he had said that he would want to be barried behind a 'whore house' if not for the Christian guys offendedness at this...so I think my review pretty much explains why I could never recomend this movie, I would like to see more movies with the touchingness of this one come out with out so much aweful content.",

Which is totally inaccurate. The only plane that was red in reality, was the Red Baron. Who was not even in this movie, otherwise all the americans would be dead. roflol:)Seriously though, the fighting sequences are great to watch, especially when you see the bullets flying through the air. If they would come out with more movies like this one, with the same technology, that would be great. Maybe less romance, and more flying action. the flying sequences were too short in my opinion. Worth buying and enjoyable!!",

Theres realistic deaths and only a couple of the characters make it to the end.-Variety. The different nationalities of the characters is good. Of course, it is World War I, so it was expected, but interesting nonetheless.The bad things:-Nothing very concrete. I'm still undecided about this being good or bad. You get only a tiny bit of information on the characters. Theres really no indication of their strengths and weaknesses. Probably because there are so many characters that they dont focus on but one or two.-Repeated plot. Its not a thorough war movie that concentrates on one incidence or place. Its just about them going up in the air several times, taking them down and coming back.-No climax. Its not really a movie in which it builds up to anything. The plot is just continuous, so theres really no high point.Overall, its an ok movie. Its good for someone that doesnt like concentration on main characters and a war plot that doesnt narrow in on one incident.",

    "review/text": "'Flyboys' is one of the best films I have ever seen, period. I was a skeptic of the movie at first, there have been so many good war movies made already, what could this one do to top any of them? While watching however, I was pleasantly surprised by not only the acting and storyline, but the soundtrack by Trevor Rabin put this one over the top.Also, 'Flyboys' is based on the real life adventures of the Escadrille Lafayette, created during the early years of WWI by the French to allow volunteer American pilots to fight even though the U.S. had not entered the war. The fact that every character in this film was real makes it hit home. You really become attached to each of the main characters as they struggle to live and fight honorably in a war with very little purpose behind it.'Flyboys' is the first 'modern' era film to attempt a portrayal of this particular story, and it does an AMAZING job. The effects, particularly the dogfights, are epic, and as mentioned, Trevor Rabin's soundtrack compliments the movie perfectly. The film summarizes itself succinctly during the opening titles...\"Though the airplane was only recently invented, it was quickly adapted for war. The young men who flew them became the first fighter pilots, and a new kind of hero was born...\"This movie is a must have for any cinema enthusiast or history buff, and spring an extra couple of bucks for the collector's edition, it comes with some neat postcards.",

    "review/text": "I for one loved this movie, my family loved it. Even my 64 year old war-veteran father who is very, very picky loved it. I for one am getting sick of all the critics dumping on it. The only other places I've seen aerial action this exciting and dynamic is in the \"Star Wars\" film series, \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" and the 1995 TV series \"Space: Above and Beyond\". What makes this film special over those is that it's not in an abstract retro-futuristic fantasy world. It's a recreation of real WWI dogfights and they look so damn real. I'm an expert at spotting FX but there where many times when I really couldn't tell when they switched from real plane, to CGI model and then to scale model.Now as for being historically inaccurate. Most of what I heard was anal-pretentious nitpicking and thus wasn't nearly as severe as some would have you believe. Most of those naysayers are just quoting some garbage some other know-it-all idiot said verbatim. Not to mention if you want precise history at such a nit-picky level as those guys insist on, go read a book. Now I wouldn't call this film a truly serious war film like \"Flags of Our Fathers\" or \"Saving Private Ryan\". It's more in the vein of the war films of the 30s and the 40s, just with new state-of-the-art visual effects. Even the love story could easily been written for a 1940s film.In many ways it reminds of the WWI episodes of \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" - In fact if you want a great companion piece to \"Flyboys\" check out the Young Indy film \"Attack of the Hawkmen\" which deals with the Lafayette escadrille as well. However keep in mind that a 2007 feature film budget can do way more then a TV movie from 1995. However they both have that old Saturday matin&eacute;e type feel.I guess that's why so many people call it clich&eacute;. I call it a good old fashion seat-of-your-pants thrill ride and a good way to introduce any young lad to the history of that time.Oh and the bonus disc of the DVD set is above average with it's highlight being a terrific documentary on the real Lafayette escadrille pilots and explanations on who each of the films characters where inspired by. It's where most of these self-proclaimed war historians got there information I suspect since everything i here them say about who each character is based on, is covered by the documentary.Now one major beef is with the stupid MPAA (Trey Parker and Matt Stone are so right about them.) They rated \"Flyboys\" PG-13 for \"War Action (which is fine) and Sexual Content\" What Sexual content they're talking about I have no clue whatsoever.The love story is sweet, innocent and old fashion and as G-rated as they come.Now there are a couple scenes in a brothel but the women are completely clothed and nothing sexual is discussed There's not even any cleavage or garters showing. If this film was made in the golden age of Hollywood I doubt even the Hayes Commission Production Code of the 40s and 50s could have found much to object to except maybe the use of the word prostitute.However this is 2007 and Anna Nicole's half-naked body is splashed all over ever news program and we have TV commercials that would have been considered soft-core porn 50 years ago so I don't see show that could be it. Heck I wouldn't be surprised if this is reason so many movie-goers and (mostly) critics didn't like this movie. They saw the \"Sexual Content\" and were geared up for some style steamy love scenes ;in the style the WWI semi-classic \"The Blue Max\".Now that I think of it I don't think I ever saw a major film critic criticize a heavily sexualized love story for being clich&eacute;'. Go figure. Not that I have anything against sex. I just don't need it to be in every TV show and movie.Lastly what I really find idiotic is the fact that most the critics who dumped on \"Flyboys\" for being clich&eacute;d and historically inaccurate gave glowing reviews to the WWII submarine turd-fest \"U-571\" with it's ridiculously well-lit, dry and roomy submarines, it's driftwood-like performance by Matthew McConaughey in the lead (While he's no Marlon Brando I'd James Franco in \"Flyboys\" over nude-bongo boy any day.)Not to mention if you want to talk historical inaccuracies, \"U-571\" completely re-writes history having Americans, rather then the British, find the first Enigma machine and decode it.Now \"Flyboys\" having planes a couple years too early or slightly the wrong color is no comparison for that level of deliberate falsification. However at RottenTomatoes.com \"U-571\" gets a whopping 67% \"FRESH\" with a consensus \"Excellent cinematography and an interesting plot accompanied by a talented cast and crew make U-571 a tense thriller.\" While \"Flyboys\" gets a 33% ROTTEN with a consensus \"Poorly scripted with mediocre acting and unconvincing battle scenes.\"Not to mention when it comes to historical inaccuracies don't even get me started on \"Pearl Harbor\", \"Titanic\" or Frank Miller's \"300\" (Which will be a huge hit despite the fact it bares little resemblance to the true story.)Now finally I know why Hollywood makes so much trash. When they made a good clean old-fashion staurday afternoon action movie critics dump on it and movie-goers end up avoiding it like the plague. Darn Shame.",

Airplanes were only 12 years old when they were adapted for combat use.The characters were strong and believeable. Their evolution from civilian to warrior is timeless while the bonds forged in combat are never reproduced under any other circumstances. The special effects were stunning. It wins on every level.I could speculate ad nauseum as to why films like The Patriot and Gods and Generals are assasinated out of the gate but the bottom line in critics are captive to agendas that have nothing to do with good films.

They are Saturday afternoon popcorn movies, and there aren't nearly enough of them. I didn't care how \"accurate\" the movie was. I had fun. I loved it. And the romance (no sex) occupied only a small part of it, as it should (unlike Pearl Harbor, which sank under the weight of it).4 stars out of 5 due to its being somewhat overlong.

Just look at some of the previous movies where enemy aircraft have been represented by aircraft which they did not even closely resemble: P-51 Mustangs painted gray to represent Me-109 German aircraft in WWII movies or AT-6 aircraft marked with Japanese insignia. The reason: they were not available anywhere either in flying condition or even for display on a flying field. Maybe the aircraft in \"Flyboys\" weren't completely historically correct in markings or the combat scenes weren't what you would expect but how many of the reviewers of this movie are historical experts or have ever seen a Neuiport 17? Maybe the computer folks who made this movie needed to do a little more research on markings and such before they released this movie but at least their techniques are a start. Give them credit for that. As far as the story line goes, Hollywood will ALWAYS be Hollywood and action and love stories sell.

There is no self-pity and no tantrums.They captured the historical reality of air missions during the first world war as well as anyone ever has. And the CGI, despite its limitations visually, allowed them to recreate a richer variety of aircraft in battle than previous live-action films were able to show. With some notible exceptions, many past WWI air films ended up in the air being dogfights between a small set of fighters. This is different.The film has a strong male point of view to it which is almost never seen these days. Rather than drunk supermen with a gun in one hand and a woman in the other ready, rather than prettyboys (Top Gun), rather than crybabies, you get ordinary guys with motivations that most people can understand.Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault does an excellent job in playing his part as well.This is a first-class retelling of some of the stories of the Escadrille LaFayette. Most films these days are unwatchable junk.

The authenticity of the WWI planes, gunfire, and interplay between pilots is beautifully captured. Howard Hughes would have been impressed. Unfortunately the lead, James Franco gives a wooden performance as the squadron leader. The supporting cast of pilots all give credible performances, but the film doesn't gain acclaimed status because of the acting. I never felt emotionally connected to the lead characters and the romantic storyline did nothing to enhance the drama the director so desperately wanted to achieve. The most immprobable scene involves Franco's rescue of his French girlfriend. While a dozen or so German troops invade the girl's home, she slips away and hides nearby; that is believable. What is preposterous is when Franco flies his plane to a nearby field without any of the German soldiers seeing or hearing it. Of course Franco and the French girl escape under a hail of German gunfire. The characterizations of the other pilots are well crafted. The Black pilot who at first is not readily welcomed, the rich, cultured pilot who is seeking his father's approval, the religious pilot who accepts his duty, the unemotional ace, the suspected \"spy\", and the small town hero who doubts his courage all contribute to the on screen cammaraderie.

I spotted several \"ooh, that's not right!\" moments, but in the end, they didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film.The CGI dogfights are well-done, in my opinion. Would it have been better if they had used real planes? You bet! Would using real planes have been a realistic objective? NO! Those old planes were dangerous as heck when they were brand new, and even modern reproduction methods haven't done much to reduce the risk. Put 40 or 50 planes in the air at once and try to choreograph a dogfight---someone's gonna die. And not all of those original pilots died in combat. There were shockingly high numbers of men killed due to engine failure and other mechanical failures. If you use CGI, you can eliminate most of the risk, plus you can get more realistic with crates catching fire, breaking up in mid-air,crashing, etc.The extras on the 2-disc DVD are pretty extensive, cover the making of the movie, and address some of the gaps between the film and the true history.",

Also, the storyline with James Franco and that French woman was done VERY well, I figured going in that that part would be a really sappy and corny, just a way to fill the in between plane fighting scenes but I really enjoyed those scenes, they were funny and very emotional. The interaction between the pilots and their own storylines was also very well written and exectued.

    "review/text": "I have to say that I agree with pretty much everyone - ratings 1 through 5 stars! All of its warts are real, but the bottom line is that if you just remember that it's NOT a documentary (although the film did make a nod to the fact that there was a WWI, and a Lafayette Escadrille, which had American volunteer pilots, and they fought the Germans!) and simply sit back and enjoy, I thought that it was a fun couple of hours. It absolutely does have the Hollywood hokum GENEROUSLY spread throughout.There are a couple of things specifically (and I'm not sure why these inaccuracies bothered me more than the many others!) that historically \"stuck in my craw,\" though, and they have to do with the aircraft and the computer graphics. The Allied aircraft, supposedly Nieuport (yes, the \"i\" is correct) 17's (introduced into service in March, 1916 as the successor to the 11) had a ROTARY engine, but it's portrayed as a RADIAL. What's the diff? Both have the cylinders arrayed like the spokes of a wheel, but a ROTARY engine actually turns around itself, unlike a radial (of extensive WWII fame, particularly), which has stationary cylinders. If you look at the Flyboy engines, they don't move! I guess that the producers either didn't know the difference, or it's too difficult to make the engine turn in the computer program (??). There's one fleeting scene showing some mechanics working on an engine in the hangar, and IT DOES ROTATE, so someone knew something. Sorry, this little tidbit just bugged me! By the way, the rotary was one reason why pilots usually had greasy faces after a flight - the rotary had to have its lubricating oil mixed with the fuel (it was castor oil, which doesn't mix with gasoline) - so along with the exaust, unburned oil flew back in the slipstream and over the pilot. Likewise, some of the machines have \"V\" shaped upper planes. Nieuports had straight wings. At least they got it right that they were sesquiplanes (lower wing smaller than upper). The wing differences are hard to understand in a computer generated film. In older movies, when they used real aircraft, it's easy to see why there were differences (look at Blue Max) - there just simply aren't enough biplanes that remotely resemble WWI aircraft still flying, so \"look-(something)alikes\" had to be used. If you're building all of the aircraft in a computer, why not make it as accurate as possible?However, I'm forgetting that this was simply entertainment. If you leave it at that, again, it's not that bad. I, for one, despite its problems, do plan to pick up a copy for fun. Enjoy!",

    "review/text": "As someone with a great interest in WWI, I had high hopes for \"Flyboys\" but found it to be a rather excruciating experience watching one-dimensional cardboard cutouts religiously follow every single last cliche' in the Hollywood playbook. A movie about a group of Americans who violated their nation's neutrality laws to fight for a foreign power in a senseless, fratricidal war, I was going to give it 2 stars for the impressive dogfighting scenes, thinking at least some of it was performed by actual pilot reenactors, until I found out that it was all CGI-generated and technologically anachronistic to boot. In any case, all the action in the world couldn't save a movie with such a predictable story and such generically boring characters.A professor once told me that a quick test of the quality of a novel or movie's characterization is whether you remember the characters' names. This movie was so mind-numbing, I was lucky to remember my own name by the end, never mind the protagonist's! I don't know if these were bad actors or they just had bad material to work with, but my family and I certainly didn't remember anyone's names, and were forced to refer to the characters by their physical attributes. Unfortunately, only a few of them- Blackie, Fatty and Spiderman-guy- had any kind of unique features, while the rest seemed as undistinguishable as snowflakes. We were glad when one of them got his hand cut off, because he then gained an identity as \"Hookhand\", and we were hoping the others would similarly discover their individuality- i.e. Burnedface, Lack-nose, One-eye - but we were disappointed.As terrible as the characters were- and I can't describe to you the interminable horror of watching a monolingual American try to woo a retarded French girl- the plot was even more disgraceful. If you've ever seen any sports movie, you've seen this one: A motley group of American misfits initially get their clocks cleaned by big, bad German bullies, led by the \"Black Falcon.\" Our scrappy Yanks get their act together and start to hold their own against the German B-team. When the Black Falcon knocks out our ace, the young hero vows revenge, which he dramatically achieves with the unexpected help of a character previously thought to be useless. Look up the word \"formulaic\" in the dictionary and the definition will probably say \"the plot of 'Flyboys.'\" Skip this one, and let's just pretend it doesn't exist.",

    "review/text": "When I saw the shorts for \"Flyboys\", I had to wonder if it were another rehashed version of the abominablePearl Harbor (Two-Disc 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition), about which I still have the occasional nightmare. I won't be having nightmares about \"Flyboys\".Set in the First World War, it follows the journey of a group of young Americans who decide, for various reasons of their own, to enlist with the French forces to fly against the Germans. They did this before the USA entered the war. Learning to fly canvas and wood planes, they soon find out the realities of air warfare and the skills of their enemies.The acting is fairly average and most of the dogfighting and aerial shots are CGI images. However, that is understandable considering there are not many of the aeroplanes left, and anyone who has built a replica would be naturally possessive and protective. That said, I thought the CGI had been well done, indeed, and was far superior to a lot that shows up in war movies. The quality was very good.For the historical inaccuracies that some have mentioned, you would have to be very knowledgable in the field of First World War aviation to pick them up, except the most obvious ones. For the average viewer, these concerns will not take away from the overall plot or enjoyment of the movie. The one point I thought was a bit rich was Rawlings landing his plane and running into No Man's Land to rescue a downed pilot. The fact that some of the best machine gunners in the world at that time could not hit him was a glaring oversight.The concession made to the performance of the aeroplanes themselves is also understandable in my own opinion. For the sheer spectacle of combat, I can see why they \"enhanced\" the performance of the planes themselves. The real thing would not have been able to do vertically climb as they did in the movie, (true), or do such snappy moves, (true), but that would have been less than exciting if the makers had stuck strictly to the reality.For sheer spectacle, this movie more than makes up for its short-comings. It is visually gripping and very much an action drama. Considering it is the first movie about First World War fliers in some decades that I know of, it was a refreshing and pleasant movie to see. I really enjoyed it.",

I digress.)As mentioned, I am someone whose interest in seeing a movie is largely based on the impression I get from the trailer, plus a look at the story synopsis. I was a little disappointed that this movie did not stay at theaters long, and just figured (not surprisingly) that this kind of movie, which was once very popular, does not have the same wide audience base in a time when movies like Jackass 2 and Borat can bring in the ticketbuyers.I took a look for myself. The movie has some great dogfighting scenes with outstanding CGFX, which was what I rented it for. However, it made the same mistake Pearl Harbor did (trying to have a romantic film and a war film and a buddy film all tied together). As a result, the pacing was a little slower than I would have liked, and it probably was a factor in why the film did not do well at the box office (the war aspect may have turned off many potential female fans who might have been interested in the romantic story; though it does have a beautiful girl as the romantic interest: actress Jennifer Decker). Another factor in its disappointing revenues may be that in a time of high-tech aerial warfare marvels (I was even an aircrew member in a couple of them), there seems to be little appreciation or interest in the saga of cloth & wood & wire aircraft, which is ironic since the level of morbid interest and excitement (higher fatality rates) would be better represented by World War 1 aircraft. In fact, one of the things that the film did not really address was the danger and unpredictability of early airplanes, especially in combat, let alone just during landings and other \"routine\" operations.The character development was brief but sufficient, since more of it would have only slowed the pacing further without adding much in the way of interest. The fight scenes are excellent, so if your remote has a working fast-forward button, this should be an okay rent.",

I am a little surprised by the very poor reviews this movie is getting, because I rather liked it, although I am the first to recognise that it could be much, much better.The strong point of this movie are the computer generated planes and air fights. WW I dogfights were a great movie material, because of their short range personal character - in fact, strangely enough, they remind me a little the STAR WARS fights between X-Wings and TIE fighters. Here the planes look really like real ones and the effect is great for any fan of aviation: Nieuport and Fokker fighters, Handley-Page and Gotha bombers and the gigantic L32 Zeppelin, they all give a great show. The movie is quite realistic and stresses well the incredibly idiotic decision of allied high command to NOT provide pilots with parachutes (Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians and even Turks had them, from the beginning of the war) on the incredible assumption, that pilots will jump from their planes at the first occasion!! That explains why the casualty rates in French, British, Italian and later American aviation were so high.There are some very weak spots. Relations between pilots and especially all the conflicts are too pinky easy and sweet, which takes away most of the realism. The main hero accomplishes alone all the most incredible things, the rest of the unit being mostly his sidekicks. The ending is a little too previsible. The love story is going nowhere and we do not even know why. There is only one really bad guy in the movie and of course he is German, etc., etc.;Jean Reno indeed is not very much used but this is a nice effort from Hollywood to hire a French to play a French officer, rather than just use an American and make him speak with a French accent... On this point, let's stress that this movie is a welcome pause in French bashing, which seems to be a kind of national sport in Hollywood this last years....But all those weak points notwithstanding, I forgive to this movie a lot, for the scenes, when the Escadrille Lafayette takes off and is flying over the beautiful French landscapes, together with a flight of cranes... And then there is this unique scene, when a whole horde of red painted Fokkers emerges from the sunlight to butcher the unsuspecting American rookies, with the Black Falcon in the lead (yes, you guessed right, the Black Falcon is the plane of the BAD GUY).There is also some good humor in \"Flyboys\" - a mascot lion named Whiskey, an American pilot who simply can not shoot straight no matters how much he tries, until.... well, no, no hints here, you will see by yourself. And the decorations of the planes, with my favorite being a seriously deranged woodpecker... This is a nice war movie, and a must if you are a fan of aviation and can simply not resist the sight of a flight of Fokkers going after some heavy Handley-Page bombers....",

Tora!\" and you'll realize just how pitiful CGI truly is. And CGI explosions (of anything) pale in comparison to movies where they really blow stuff up.As an ex-AF pilot and military aviation historian (who has also written a WW I historical novel about air combat, 'Once a Knight'), I can't help but cringe whenever I watch CGI aircraft scenes. This movie was no exception.Despite all of that, I did enjoy the movie. Overall, it was fun, and that's what movies are all about in the end.One caution: I bought this DVD without noticing that there are two versions -- a 1-disc and a 2-disc. I ended up with the 1-disc with essentially no special features. I really wanted those special features (more than the actual movie). So be warned...and spend the extra couple of bucks for the 2-disc version!",

Sorry, but WWI rotary engines had only wide open or no ignition settings. Partial power was achieved by intermittent blipping of the ignition kill switch and the inertia of the rotating engine mass keep them from stalling.They had chocks on the wheels and the ground crew spun the prop. They usually took off from where they were parked and they taxied in blipping away to their parking place. If The Black Falcon propped his own airplane in the middle of the field, I can guarantee that his own prop would slice him up like a deli salami!Also, very few DR-1's were painted all red. That was reserved forBaron Manfred von Richtofen. Otherwise I liked the movie.Yes, I'm a pilot.",

That movie used real WW1 vintage aircraft, that actually have weight to them and do NOT perform impossible flying stunts that the Blue Angels do not even attempt using FA-18 jets.Pacing is terribly frantic, music is insufferable, character development and construction of any dramatic impact is non-existent.Pass this one by, unless you're willing to spend 2 hours viewing an all too typical expensive, wasteful, useless, hollywood blockbuster bomb.",

When he and his two daughters returned to the U.S., he found work as a elevator operator ( not a airmail carrier ). The U.S. refused to even allow him to fly with them during WWI. When Gen. DeGaulle made a state visit to New York in the 1950s, Gene went to his hotel. DeGaulle personally came downstairs to pay a visit to his old friend.

    "review/summary": "Its about time we had a first rate war movie.",
    "review/text": "I am a huge fan of war movies, particularly air war movies, but unfortunately Hollywood releases few movies in this genre. When they do release a war movie it is usually poorly rendered, such as \"Pearl Harbor.\" They do not seem to understand that war is a human endeavor, probably the most serious endeavor in which humans are involved. They also do not understand that movies are about story telling and war stories need to be told. Adding to the difficulty is the expense of filming a war saga (all those tanks and planes and ships are expensive to render on the big screen). Computer generated images (CGI) should have done a lot to mitigate the cost of producing war movies but such releases are still few and far between.When a new war film is released it often does not rise to meet expectations. I waited months for \"Pearl Harbor\" to be released and was sorely disappointed when it was. It should have been spectacular but only perhaps fifteen minutes of it were worth the money. There was an excellent Battle of Britain sequence at the beginning, a few first rate shots of the Pearl Harbor attack in the middle and some really good flight scenes of the Doolittle Raid. The story was horrible, the acting was miserable and I was left thinking that someone should have made a movie about the Battle of Britain, the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle Raid.There are many war subjects which scream for attention but Hollywood seems to have a problem making movies which illustrate heroism, valor and self-sacrifice. One particular subject which has never been portrayed on the big screen is the story of the pilots of Torpedo Squadron 8 who flew into the Battle of Midway during World War II. Flying from Midway Island and the U.S.S. Hornet, a few Americans fought a fight to the finish against overwhelming odds when everything hung in the balance. If there is an American \"Charge of the Light Brigade\" this was it. Attacking a fleet of four Japanese aircraft carriers, these pilots were all shot down without ever hitting a Japanese ship. Their sacrifice, however, allowed the American dive-bombers to reach their targets and sink most of the Japanese fleet in what was the greatest U.S. Naval victory of all time. Yet, Hollywood has never seen fit to depict this story on the big screen (however, the attack by Luke Skywalker on the first Deathstar could have been based on the story of Torpedo 8).With all this in mind, I looked forward to seeing \"Flyboys\" with not a little trepidation. The lead up to the movie was not encouraging. There was little advertising and I had to go online to see the trailer. It was as if Hollywood was saying: \"Oh yeah, and we have this war film, too.\"When \"Flyboys\" was finally released, I was pleasantly surprised. It is a fictionalized account of the Lafayette Escadrille, a squadron of American pilots who fought for the French before the U.S. entered World War I. I think that the real story would have been just as good (someone should do a movie on Raoul Lufbery or Frank Luke) but the movie is close enough to the truth that even an amateur historian can enjoy it. Historical fiction, when done well, such as in the books of Michael or Jeff Shaara, can accurately depict real events and the makers of \"Flyboys\" succeeded in doing so.The flight scenes were spectacular and excellently rendered. The planes were accurate depictions of the aircraft used during the period, the characters were representative of those who actually flew in the Escadrille and the actors performed in a manner which did justice to the unit. Particularly exciting were the attacks by the Escadrille on the German bombers. There were some historical inaccuracies but those were not glaring. Most of the tactics used by the pilots in the movie were believable and I could think of an example of each from the reading I have done on the pilots of that era . Some did stretch the rules of physics somewhat but did not detract from the movie (I don't think bi-planes could fly upside down for long as the fuel systems relied on gravity but I am no expert).Not wanting to spoil movie surprises, I will attempt to explain a few things that will only make sense within the context of the movie. The fear of fire was such that some pilots did carry pistols with which to end their lives rather than burn to death as parachutes were not yet commonly used. Attacks on balloons and on Zeppelins were particularly dangerous. Early in the war, when airplanes were used merely for reconnaissance, pilots carried firearms with which to shoot at enemy pilots and some actually did. Chivalry between pilots during the war did exist up to a point. Pilots did crash land in no-man's land and were forced to run for their lives. Some pilots did machine-gun enemy pilots who had crashed landed (though this was not common). The mascot of the Lafayette Escadrille was the same kind as that shown in the movie. Finally, if a man was born a slave in, say, 1855, and he had a son in, say, 1899 at the age of 44, that son could have flown for the Lafayette Escadrille at the age of 18.The movie depicted a romance of sorts between the main character and a French woman but it was of the type common during the war. It added to the movie rather than detracted from it (the \"Pearl Harbor\" romance, destroyed that film, leaving the movie with no sympathetic characters). I am no real judge of \"chick flicks\" but my wife and daughters saw \"Flyboys\" and all want to see it again.The soundtrack from \"Flyboys,\" written by Trevor Rabin, really added to whole movie experience. I am a true John Williams fan and Rabin's music is right up there with Williams. The first thing I did when I reached my computer after seeing the movie was to check Amazon.com to see if the soundtrack had been released (it will be available 10 October).Maybe only once every ten years is a good war movie released and this one should not be missed. I suggest that you see it at the theater if possible (on the biggest screen available). I suggest you hurry as it was only at my theater for two weeks but I managed to see it three times. It is also number one on my \"must buy\" list of DVD's.Now I can only hope that the upcoming movie \"Flags of our Fathers,\" based on the excellent book by James Bradley and Ron Powers, is as good as this movie was.",

It's not just that they drag in every movie cliche thats ever been used in this type of story; there is literally not a single authentic detail or presentation of such detail in this film. The airplanes are wrong, the airplane paint jobs, markings. armaments are wrong. The clothes and uniforms are wrong, even the airfield that these guys are flying out of is wrong. It appears that the film makers, instead of researching information on life as a volunteer in the french air service of that period, opted for looking at old hollywood movies on this subject.

TOP GUN rip off with extended volleyball scenes? What? American men vacationing in France? For the record. I didn't see one volleyball in the film. In fact, I didn't see one guy without his shirt or a shower scene. Don't listen to bogus reviews. Please, don't listen to these comments, because you will be missing a marvelous, sharp, beautiful and BASED ON A TRUE STORY World War I picture that blew me away.The extent that the filmmakers went to make this a realistic, poigniant and time capturing homage to the FLYBOYS of World War I who went over to France BEFORE America joined the war, is stunning. After watching this film, I couldn't believe that this film hasn't received more accolades.It's a little one dimensional, but that was the way life was for the pilots of World War I who were volunteering to fly war planes only years after the plane was even invented. They arrived in France, they trained for three weeks and they were flying missions that had claimed thousands of lives and had a less than 5% return rate.In between missions, their lives were dull and simple. Parked in the middle of a French country side, they would frequent a single pub and drink to the men who didn't return that day.FLYBOYS is based on real stories from journals of the real men the movie portrays. The lives they left behind to become pilot gods. The loves they lost and left behind. The people they met and the amazing world changing missions they embarked on.James Franco plays Blaine Rawlings, a young man who was about to lose his ranch and be arrested, motivating him to enter World War I as a fighter pilot before the American government joined the fight. He meets a beautiful french women named Lucienne (newcomer Jennifer Decker) who speaks little english, but their bond is realistic and beauiful portrayed.The most breathtaking part of FLYBOYS is the battle scenes themselves. The planes circle and dart between the clouds, streaming their clouds of bullets across the sky. The rudementry targeting system and the flaws in their guns. Everything is captured.Bottom line. FLYBOYS is breath-taking. A wonderful film and exactly the kind of movie that Howard Hughes wanted to make. Today's technology allows it to happen in glorious fashion.",

It shows how they came for many reasons adventure, to escape, idealism etc. How accurate is it, I suspect a fair bit although I did not like the way the Germans are shown as evil in this film. Something I don't think warranted by their behaviour in WW1.The acting is below average. When they showed the daily lives of the people and the pilots in no scenes could I say they grabbed me. Often I found them boring even scenes that were suppose to be gripping. Partly I suspect because the lives of the people were not interesting, real life often is not gripping and partly because I did not think much of their acting.However it is different with the action scenes. They were terrific. Imagine being is such a plane, which in today's terms is junk without a parachute. Dangerous to just fly and these guys were fighting one another up there. If anything goes wrong with the plane you are dead. They must have been extremely brave men.

Which is a shame, because all of the elements were there to make the best WWI aviation movie in history, and instead, they made this crud. Who was the historical advisor on this one? Paris Hilton maybe? No, wait, she could've done better.Where to start? Fokker triplanes at the end of 1916? Nope, that was later. Five thousand Fokker triplanes, all painted brilliant red, with crosses all over them, even on the upper surfaces of the lower wings? Nope. A zeppelin raid in broad daylight with a triplane escort? Nope. Close up views of the smallish looking Neuports that show the brakes on the backs of the wheels? That's plain stupid. Brits, Frenchies, and Americans all operating off the same airfield and sharing airplanes no less? Nope. Enough time between missions for pilots to apparently take week long vacations through the countryside? Nope and stupid. A German aerodrome occupied apparently only by one pilot and one little guy to salute him? Wierd and dopey. One lion, not two? What happened to \"Soda\"?That's the short list, there's much, much more. This movie's about as historically accurate as Pearl Harbor was a few years back, where Ben Afflack single-handedly won WWII. They even have a wonderful CG'd version of the Aquitania bringing the Americans over to France, but dash it all, the Aquitania was serving as a hospital/troop ship at that time.Add to all this a very poor and pointless love story with an illiterate French woman. What was the point of that? Again, all the ingredients were here to make an outstanding movie, and these guys made something so mind-numbingly poor that any military history buff is going to be disgusted with the missed opportunity. It's got some great visual effects, but so did Independence Day, and in the end, Independence Day was more believable than Flyboys.This movie is just painfully stupid. Will there never be a movie capable of matching THE BLUE MAX as the best WWI flying movie ever made? Save your money, buy THE BLUE MAX, and enjoy a realistic story with REAL airplanes doing REAL flying, and not a bunch of computer generated Fokkers moving like they're F-16s.",

My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife. The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences. What a shame, as I had hoped for better than this.Don't buy this turkey. Save your money and get \"Dogfight\" -- more accurate, exciting, and historically true.",

The period costuming and sets are very well done. The battle scenes are not gory nor grotesque. The DVD may be shown to the entire family.Too bad this flick doesn't have a different name (insuring more popularity). \"Fly Boys\" is recommended to action adventure DVD aficionados and those curious about World War 1.",

I found the acting to be mediocre and the tone of the film was somewhat cheesy, I thought. I was expecting a serious war film in the category of 'Saving Private Ryan', but what I witnessed was more similar to Jerry Bruckheimer's 'Pearl Harbor.' It is more of a \"feel-good\" war movie, than a realistic one. Don't get me wrong, the film had it's moments, but it just wasn't what I expected. So if you just want to be entertained for a couple hours, I could think of plenty of worse movies, but if you're expecting an epic war film, 'Flyboys' is not it.",

However, I was slightly disappointed with the picture. I thought it would stand out and be more vibrant, but maybe it was intentional because it is a WWI period piece. The audio was also not the best I've heard either. All the special features from the 2 disc dvd appear to be here. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't own it already get the Blu-Ray version. If you do than you can consider if you really want to upgrade. IT'S UP TO YOU!",

    "review/text": "Flyboys is a 2006 American drama film set during World War I, starring James Franco, Martin Henderson, Jean Reno, Jennifer Decker, David Ellison, Abdul Salis, Philip Winchester and Tyler Labine. It was directed by Tony Bill, a pilot and aviation enthusiast.[1] Screenplay was written by Phil Sears, Blake T. Evans and David S. Ward with the screen story by Blake T. Evans.The film follows the enlistment, training and combat experiences of a group of young Americans who volunteer to become fighter pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille, the 124th air squadron formed by the French in 1916. The squadron consisted entirely of American volunteers who wanted to fly and fight in World War I during the main years of the conflict, 1914-1917, before the United States later joined the war against the Central Powers.A group of young Americans go to France, for different personal reasons, and volunteer to fight in the French Air Service, L'A&eacute;ronautique militaire, during World War I prior to America's entrance into the war. One of the main characters, Blaine Rawlings (James Franco) faced with the foreclosure of his family ranch in Texas, decides to enlist after seeing a newsreel of aerial combat in France. Dilettante Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) joins because of his overbearing father. African-American boxer Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis), who had been accepted as an athlete in France, was motivated to \"pay back\" his adopted country. These American recruits were under the command of French Captain Georges Thenault (Jean Reno), while the veteran fighter ace Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson), a fellow American, takes over as their mentor.During their training, the film mainly deals with the struggles each pilot has with the demanding flying; later, the focus shifts to the aerial dogfights that dominate the front line missions. Themes of camaraderie, racial prejudice, revenge and love are also explored. The film ends with an epilogue that relates each film character to the real-life Lafayette Escadrille figures on which the movie was based.[2] One charming touch in this film is that the hero is given a small bear, which he carries as a good luck charm. This is an obvious reference to the small bear carried as a good luck charm by a pilot in \"Wings,\" a silent film about the Lafayette Escadrille, which, in 1927, was the first film ever to win the Academy Award for best picture.",

I love all war/historical movies that are based on real people. This movie follows about 7 military pilots in WWI that are based on real Americans or on composite characters. It's not as dramatic and over-the-top as a big-budget war movie, but that makes it a lighter form of entertainment. I'm going to buy the DVD so I can watch it again and share it with other people, whereas I couldn't stomach re-watching Private Ryan. If you've ever enjoyed an airshow, you'll love the old-time planes in the movie. The pilots are exposed to the elements, sticking out of small paper-wing airplanes with prop engines that need to be started by hand, and glide to a stop in open fields. One of the characters says \"planes were only invented 10 years ago!\" All the pilots had interesting life stories, one an aristocrat, one the son of a slave.. there is also a love story with the James Franco/Blaine character which I liked (he's quite handsome!).",

    "review/text": "James Franco stars in this exciting movie based on the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille, a group of American pilots flying for the French in the early days of World war I.Franco portrays Blaine Rawlings, a young rancher from Texas who's family ranch has just been repossessed. While watching a movie at the local moviehouse, he sees a newsreel about pilots fighting in Europe. He decides to enlist with the French Lafayette Escadrille and battle the Germans. Soon, Rawlings and fellow pilots William Jensen (Philip Winchester), Lyle Porter (Michael Jibson), Eddie Beagle (David Ellison), Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis), and Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine) are on their way to France. All have come from different backgrounds and circumstances, but they all share one common goal; to fight and defeat the Germans.Upon arriving in France, they are met by Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno). It's Thenault's job to train the American pilots proper tactics in order to battle the Germans. There are already some American pilots in France. One is Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson). He has become one of the best pilots in the Lafayette Escadrille, already having shot down over twenty German aircraft. The lead pilot for the Germans is the menacing Black Falcon (Gunnar Winbergh) and his group of skilled pilots. All of the Germans fly the famed Fokker triplane, painted blood-red. All except the Falcon's, who's is jet black.After completing their training, the Americans are finally ready to take to the skies and do battle with the Germans. During the course of the movie, there are several thrilling aerial combat sequences between the Americans and Germans, especially the sequence where the Germans send a zeppelin to bomb Paris. Relationships develop among the pilots as well. Rawlings becomes the de facto leader of the group, and many of the other pilots look to him for support and advice. Rawlings has also developed a relationship with a local French girl named Lucienne (Jennifer Decker). She bandaged Rawlings' leg after a flying accident, and he became attracted to her. However, she can't speak English and he can't speak French. But the language barrier can't hide the feelings between the two.The missions become more and more dangerous for the Americans, and soon, some of the pilots are lost in combat. But the Americans keep going up to fight it out with the Germans despite their lack of experience. Their will to fight and courage is unquestioned as these heroic men continue to do battle with the enemy.This is an outstanding movie. The story of the famed Lafayette Escadrille is told with complete historical accuracy. The acting, especially by James Franco and Jean Reno, is excellent. The plot is well-conceived, and the amazing aerial combat sequences are the highlight of the film. The romance between Rawlings and Lucienne his handled wonderfully. It does not become so out of control as to take over the movie. Rather, it is allowed to grow at a slower pace that holds the viewer's interest.I give this great movie my highest recommendation. History fans will enjoy it for its great combat sequences and attention to detail. Laypersons will enjoy the romance between Rawlings and Lucienne. Watch \"Flyboys\" and see how a group of inexperienced American pilots became one of the most feared squadrons of World War I.",

    "review/text": "I confess I was entertained by the movie -in those moments when I wasn't screaming at the TV. Some of the historical inaccuracies were so glaring that even for a work of fiction it was hard to swallow. At the beginning the movie states that 9 million would eventually die in WWI - soliders perhaps. That total is nowhere complete if you add in the civillian dead. A good number of which would have come from the area in which the characters were fighting. The Verdun front was a wasteland for miles - towns were obliterated from the shelling - the area around the fronts were ruined for not years but decades. No cheery farmhouse with well-fed children, no trees or plowed fields visible from the air, nothing but death and destruction for miles and miles. Trench warfare was not confined to a thin sliver. Though the front itself moved only yards the shelling and death reigned over an extended area. There are villages in the area that never returned and if you drive over the battlefield even now 90 years later as I did, you can still see the craters and hills caused by the shelling. The aviators were above the day to day merciless killing field but they were not untouched by it. My biggest problem with the film was the complete santization of WWI. The northern part of France and southern Belgium were devasted far more thoroughly than even Germany in WWII. It was truely hell on earth. Other reviewers have addresed the inaccuracies in the planes used - do not get me started on the mechanized land transportation. Tanks were only beginning to be developed and would not have been used as shown - also correct me if I am wrong but the Germans had already crossed the Meuse River much earlier in the War. At this point in time they would have been drive back - probably by Black Jack Pershing. The producers could have spent a bit more money on some historical research and less on their computer graphics. They did not get their money's worth there either. As it was, I could never tell who was who during the arial combat sequences. I would have sworn one fellow was dead only to have him reappear later in the movie. I did enjoy the camaraderie and would have like to see more of the unit as a whole.",

    "review/text": "James Franco (most popular as Harry Osborn in the Spiderman movie series) carries this movie with his portrayal of Blaine Rawlings...a soft-spoken cowboy that can play rough when he needs to and fly a single engine WWI fighter like there's no tomorrow.Tony Bill somehow directed this could-have-been-a-TV-movie-or-mini-series onto the big screen for an approximate $13 million box office take. After DVD sales I suppose the $$$ intake will be better than TV so what the heck do I know.But the acting and story execution are such that you'd think it was made for TV. The action scenes are really fun, but questionably believable as the aces chat with each other over their flying machines in mid air and hoot and holler like they're in a rodeo.The ground scenes are mostly tough too watch. One ground battle scene is so outrageously unbelievable that the credibility meter flat-lines for a few minutes there at that point in the movie. And then there's the underlying love story that is so poorly done and unnecessary that cutting it completely would not have taken away one iota of the true story of a group of the first WWI fighter pilots.This could easily have been a 90-minute movie, but Hollywood for whatever reason has decided not to release a film under the 120 minute mark anymore. In Flyboys you'll find yourself hooting and hollering for more dogfight action as the ground scenes roll on.Overall...I didn't not like the movie. I was entertained. But, given a second chance, I'd wait to see this where it was meant to be: on TV (or cable).P.S.--Franco's character Rawlings should have had a Green Goblin painted on the side of his plane instead of his ranch insignia...now that would have been cool.",

Not only am I satisfied that I purchased it for my home collection, I have also gifted it to a friend and a relative. This movie has a cast of fairly unknown actors and does a fine job of recreating what squadron life must have been for Americans and non French citizens in WWI in the Lafayette Esquadrille. The battle scenes are what most people are interested in that buy a movie of this type for and this movie does deliver with thrilling battle sequences. Although there is a love interest with innocent romance in this film, it never gets in the way of the action. The battle scene with the French Neuports battling the German Dirigible, escorted by German DRI fighters is riveting. One of the veteran German fighter pilots is a real villain, but he finally gets what's coming to him in the end.",

    "review/text": "I purchased this dvd after finding it got a very limited release at the cinemas here in australia (one session a day at major cimemas in it's first week of release here is not what I would call a good sign) and failed to see it on the big screen.My first thought watching it was that this is the sort of movie that you need to see on the big screen. It is something that I still plan on doing. Despite it's very limited cinema release here, I know of a few old cinema venues around town that show movies months after their initial runs have ended. I plan on visiting one to see Flyboys to see it how it should be seen, on the big screen.That all said, the first big dogfight scene of the movie had me screaming in frustration. A few other reviewers have talked about the historical accuracy of the film being refreshing. My question to that is how do they explain then seeing a whole squadron (or the equivilent of the time) of Fokker Triplanes diving in to attack?? Knowing that only a few ever made it to the front, and the ones that did make it there, never lasted long in service due to a slight problem of wings breaking off in flight??!! Yes, I am being perdantic, and we are talking hollywood here I know. But to go to all the detail with the amazing looking CGI, I would have liked them to go with a little bit of research and realism as well.The whole 'Black Falcon' character is just an insult to the original red baron, especially the scene of where an american flyer is gunned down on the ground (this is not a world war II movie chaps). But this, along with the typical and banal love story, is what left a bitter taste in my mouth about this film. It just follows the cliche`s so terribly with the plot and story. No insight to the characters, no developed empathy for them and what they must have gone through. Pretty pictures and awe-inspiring dogfight sequences for sure, but no substance.I guess it was my mistake expecting something like the blue max and das boot, which this film surely isn't. Disappointing, and a shame. I'll be seeing 'letters from iwo jima' on sunday, wishing that 'flyboys' could have had the same emotional impact. Chances lost.",

    "review/text": "This movie could have been very good. The acting is for the most part believable - Martin Henderson in particular gives an excellent portrayal as the embittered, war-weary squadron commander, and is by far the standout performance. James Franco as always does well with what he has been given. The historical background of certain aspects of the Lafayette Escadrille is given screen time as well as World War 1 pilot training tactics - that's nice to see.What destroys the film are the ridiculous aerial combat sequences. There are a few decent scenes but the bad far outweighs the good. Firstly, practically every German fighter is a DR-1 mocked up in the colours of Richtofen's Flying Circus - why sacrifice authenticity for a cliche? Then the directors felt the need to have an evil 'Enemy-Ace' who goes around strafing downed allied pilots as the central German antagonist. Instances like this did happen, but this is just another tired cliche that comes across as dismal. The worst offence however is the depiction of dogfighting. The idiotic manoeuvres and speeds portayed are totally unrealistic. Why do these film directors constantly feel the need to do this? It's as if the normal capabilities of the aircraft aren't enough for them (think Pearl Harbour vs. Dark Blue World or Independance Day vs. Top Gun - the difference is dramatic.) Then they'll throw in some gung-ho victory cry or cornball line to cap it off...In short, this is another film to add to the long, long list of movies that begin with promise and then deteriorate.",

    "review/text": "First I like to address the controversy sustained by various reviewers of other presentation of this film about accuracy or inaccuracy of historical events.As usually occurs when Hollywood's products states \"based on historical or true facts\" viewers should take the statement as \"very loosely based on historical or true facts\", such is the case here. So do not get annoyed when lots of tri-planes shows up or a zeppelin intends to bomb Paris, those are the usual \"historical licenses\" of this kind of films.I regard this movie as an \"action film\" as for example \"Indiana Jones\" or \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" and as such is quite good.\"Flyboys\" (2006) was directed by multifaceted Tony Bill who is also actor and producer of many films.The story is based on the ventures of young Americans volunteers to become pilots of Lafayette Escadrille. From all over the States with different motivations they go to France without even knowing a French word.There they are trained and launched, still green, into the fry suffering losses and evolving step by step into veteran and even aces.I love the special effects now possible with CGI, crowds of planes may be shown, fighting each other fiercely and giving the word \"action\" a full new meaning.Play acting is correct, with only Jean Reno as Capt. Thenault over par, beautiful French actress Jennifer Decker as Lucienne give way to romance.The runtime, 140 minutes, is a little excessive.A good movie for a variety of audiences: WWI buffs, action movie's fan, romance fans.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",

This movie, Flyboys, was about perfect for our Saturday Night Viewing needs. The story line was very simple, there was a sweet little tragic love story easily comprehended by a 9 year old, and some walloping good special effects of bi-planes flying and shooting each other. The effects are what one should watch this movie for, as they are able to induce suspended disbelief in even the most jaded viewer. One is left with a sense of respect for the men who did fly these planes back when there were no parachutes. In fact, the Prince evinced renewed interest in his great grandfather who few a biplane in WWI for the British. So it wasn't a waste of time at all.

    "review/summary": "Watchable World War One Dogfight Movie",
    "review/text": "There's something both romantic and intimidating about the mechanized slaughter that plagued Europe at the beginning of the 20th century during what that generation called 'the GREAT War' and we call World War One. While French and Germans were slaughtering each other on the ground by the millions with the help of first generation tanks, early model machine guns and clouds of mustard gas, some privileged few were confronting their enemies in the air, riding on small, fragile, underpowered but deadly airplanes, trying to obliterate opponents riding the same or protecting/attacking bomb-carrying larger, motorized flying machines or giant, bloated, terror-inspiring airships.It's a historical fact that a handful of American took sides in this battle at a time their own country, the United States, was officially neutral. They decided to help the French side by forming their own Escadrille Lafayette of flying knights. The Escadrille, famous for its bravery AND its partying while off duty, distinguished itself at Verdun and many of its members were recognized as Aces, some receiving valuable French medals for bravery.The movie attempts to follow, to the extent that a fiction movie can, the historical record. We see the initial members as they make their decision to fight for France, we watch them train and then we watch them fight the Germans. It's fighter vs. fighter, fighter attacking the enemy's bombers, fighter protecting their own bombers, fighter attacking the Zeppelin and fighter strafing the enemy air base and, on several occasions, we watch air duels between Aces on either side. In addition, there is some romance, a tiny bit of racial tension and we watch some personal problems as they are dealt with by the squad's members.This is a very visual, CGI enhanced to the point of almost cartoonish-looking movie when it comes to the numerous dogfight scenes and its most attractive feature is the air battles. The scruffy and fragile-looking French fighters, the intimidating, red-colored German Fokkers, the bombers, the Zeppelin, they all look spectacular in ways that only today's video enhancement technologies can produce. One may conclude that, maybe there's too much fighting and too little character development but this is not a psychological drama. It's about aerial fighting and this is what we get to see in a movie that comes pretty close to being a WW1 documentary. All the little conflicts between the squad's members or between them and the French military or the other American volunteers are insignificant when viewed within the context of the war against the Germans.The movie is good at what it attempts to deliver - in this case, the dogfights - but, after a while, the fighting gets repetitive and the movie seems to be stretching a bit too long. This is as close to a pure dogfight action movie as it gets.Recommended as a rental or even as a keeper for any lover of war action videos.P.S. While many of the details are fictionalized enhancements or pure inventions, it is historically true that the squadron had lions as pets. The movie shows us one. In fact, they had TWO lion cubs named Whiskey and Soda.",

    "review/text": "Flyboys is rather a disappointment even if you're not expecting much. The Lafayette Escadrille - a French squadron of American pilots who fought in the First World War before the USA entered the conflict - is a great subject for a film, but somehow keeps on falling short. William Wellman's semi-autobiographical Lafayette Escadrille was so brutally re-edited by the studio that he never made another film, yet Tony Bill's film feels like it could have done with a firmer hand somewhere down the line. Rather than a gritty, brutally realistic war movie it harks back to silent cinema and WW2 flagwavers, concentrating on often-cartoonish heroics by one-dimensional characters unmemorably played by a bland cast. With a charismatic star in the lead this might not have been an insurmountable problem, but with only Jean Reno as their commander providing any star quality the film is often as flat as the ill-advised digital photography that makes much of the film look like a Turner TV movie at times. Even on the small screen its lack of detail, depth and limited colour range are distractingly problematic. It doesn't make particularly good use of its 138-minute running time and there's surprisingly little sense of time or place either. The characters' attitudes are often more late than early-20th century while its attitude to accuracy is schizophrenic: it gets a lot of pertinent small details right while larger ones slip by unchecked if they look cool enough (if the film is to be believed, the German air force consisted almost entirely of red triplanes).As vanity projects go (the film was allegedly largely financed by co-star David Ellison's billionaire father), it's certainly not as disastrous as Gunbus/Sky Bandits, but like that forgotten box-office fiasco it suffers from trying to make an old-fashioned gung ho adventure set in the one war in which such comic book heroics have never seemed at home. Using the industrial killing fields of the first modern war as a backdrop for an action movie seems almost like setting The Great Escape in Auschwitz. But even ignoring that, it fails to work on its own terms as a simple adventure story. There's far too much unconvincing melodrama, be it James Franco carrying out an unlikely rescue of a pilot crashed in No Man's Land or an even more unlikely rescue of his sweetheart and her siblings from behind German lines. However, even these cannot prepare you for the absurdity of the way he finally takes on the dastardly homicidal Hun in the underwhelming finale: all that's missing is Franco saying \"Sayonara, sucker!\" It's not that such things couldn't or didn't happen as that the film fails to sell them in a more cynical age.But the biggest problem is the aerial scenes, primarily dependent on Cgi. You may not always be able to see the joins, but it's often curiously unconvincing as weightless planes defy the laws of aerodynamics for a cool shot, with the mayhem often cut short because computer-rendering time is so expensive. The camera may be able to get right in the thick of the action, but you never once feel like you're flying with the characters and it's never as impressive as the kind of footage the likes of Skeets Kelly and Johnny Jordan were able to get in the The Blue Max and Aces High, let alone earlier classics like Wings and The Dawn Patrol. And there's the problem that when you know it's just pixels rather than real people in real planes, all sense of danger and peril is gone. CGI may be easier and safer, but who says it SHOULD be easier? The choreography of the dogfights isn't that impressive either - for the first half of the film adequate seems to be the aim, with only a sequence where the pilots take on German planes strafing refugee columns really catching fire and living up to its potential. Even an attack on a Zeppelin seems more okay than inspired. Certainly there's nothing in the film to compare to the dazzling but brief Hell's Angels scenes in The Aviator. Adding to the general lack of inspiration is Trevor Rabin's score, which wears the film's temp track proudly on its sleeve - parts of it follow The Patriot so closely that you wonder why they didn't just give John Williams a screen credit of his own.It's watchable enough if you're in an undemanding mood, and Jennifer Decker makes an appealing leading lady, but it's hard to shake the feeling that the material would have worked better as a weekly TV series - though, if it were anything like this film, one that would probably be cancelled after a handful of episodes.",

The recently invented flying machine was adopted by armies as an observation platform that was better than the earlier tethered balloon. In September 1914 an observation airplane saw the German flanking attack, they were able to stop it at the first Battle of the Marne using the taxis of Paris (fast mechanized deployment). The way to stop observation airplanes was to shoot them down with another armed airplane. First rifles, then machine guns. The way to stop an armed fighter was with another armed fighter. Bombing was another development, as well as anti-aircraft guns. Trench warfare prevented the maneuvers used by generals of the past. A stalemate followed.A young man in Texas wants to get out of town. Another leaves Nebraska for \"The War to End War\". An American boxer joins the Lafayette Escadrille. So too a dropout from Harvard. The men meet their mascot \"Whiskey\" and the issue of racism. The men undergo elementary training in flying and tactics. The average life of a pilot was six weeks. The German Air Force predominated in 1916. Fighters will accompany Handley-Page bombers to attack German supplies. No parachutes for pilots. \"Beware of the Hun in the sun!\" There is a dogfight, some are shot down. One flyer seeks love. There is a pleasant scene. Then they are scrambled to pursue German bombers. Another dogfight with wins and losses.One flyer returns to see a girlfriend. There is a drama in the history of one flyer. Why did he miss his target? A flight of Fokkers attacked a town, the Lafayette Escadrille comes to the rescue. One pilot lands in No Man's Land, and is rescued in an incredible manner. Was the war meaningless? Who will win? Can one flyer rescue his girlfriend? [Did anyone fly at night then?] It was a dramatic rescue. \"Don't ever do that again!\" Next they attack a Zeppelin. [These bombed London at night.] The film shows the effects of machine gun fire on the pilots and airplanes. The hospital is being evacuated. Will they meet again? There is another mission to attack Jametz. This time it will be a flanking attack to surprise the enemy with escorted bombers. There is another dogfight to let the bombers get through. There is a last dogfight between the fighter airplanes. Will the good guy survive? The last scenes tell about the flyer's future.This is a good film in spite of the story. This film uses CGI to recreate the known past. A better story makes a better film. You may find a book about this subject educational. Hollywood provides entertainment, not history.

The hi-tech aspects of this film allows us to know more about what these kids did, and make no mistake, these flyers were kids.",

I have heard many people say that it is not very accurate, but I have done extensive research into WWI air combat and the Lafayette Escadrille in particular, and I thought the movie was very well done. The only real anachronism I saw was that all the German planes in the movie were painted like the Red Baron, but in truth, the planes from both sides, looked so much alike that on a movie screen, it would be hard to tell who was shooting who, so I think it was a liberty that needed to be taken so as not to confuse the viewer. The extra features on the second disk were also enjoyable for anyone who is interested in the time period, and I really suggest the deleted scenes as well. I thought they added to the movie a lot and wished they hadn't been deleted! Over all, I am glad I decided to purchase the collector's addition and was not disappointed in it.",

    "review/text": "I think people rag on this movie a little too much. If it's not as good as the reigning classic of World War One dogfight films, 1966's The Blue Max, then at least it was a notch above most of what sat beside it in the multiplex in the fortnight it was out. (How many reviewers, seeking originality, headlined their write-ups \"Bombs Away\"? More than a few.) Movies about the First World War are almost nonexistent today and I salute the courage it took to go out on a limb to tell a forgotten story.All that said, yes, the technical inaccuracies, which I won't list here, did irk sensibilities a time or ten, and one couldn't help but feel the plot was something that got in the way of the special effects, which were often little short of spectacular, but the funny thing is I've found that the very points which instigated the greatest number of complaints about this film turned out to be those things which actually were based on the historical reality of the Escadrille de Lafayette, its experiences and its members. Go figure.Flyboys isn't going to be a classic but what is? I personally think we're residing in the age of the anti-classic. Flyboys is watchable, has some good parts, and means well even when it comes up short. I admire the effort to produce this kind of low-appeal movie in the age of \"a blockbuster or else\" film making and am glad I own this title.And, oh, yeah, that's NOT Stephen Baldwin in there, guys!",

After watching the extras and listening to the producers/director addressing the historical debate, I felt better. They freely admit that they took artistic licence with certain things for the sake of entertainment, which is fair enough. Unlike the makers of The Red Baron, whose producer/director claim with amazing straigh-faces that their movie is historically accurate, which is totally false.The flight scenes from Flyboys were great, the characters were enjoyable and the aircraft were a joy to see in action. Once you get over the fact that the Germans are all flying red Fokker triplanes, except of course, the EEEEEEVIL German, who naturally flies a black one, the combat scenes are worth the cost of the dvd alone. There is some genuine comedy in the movie, you can empathise with the characters and the photography was first rate. I can thoroughly recommend this movie for what it is.Great entertainment!",

Rawlings, the Texan, falls in love with a young woman he meets at a bordello. Keeping their eyes on them are Captain Thenault and Cassidy, the resident ace, who keeps a pet lion. This is a great movie. The flight scene special effects were difficult to impossible to distinguish from the actual flying. The aerial combat was exciting, tense, and realistic with the attack on the zeppelin being the best scene of the movie. This movie does not shy away from the ugly aspects of combat.

    "review/text": "Since Top Gun, war movies about aerial warfare have always taken second seat to war movies about land battles, in terms of award nominations and box office takes. This movie shares this fate. It came out in 2006 and was probably the least hyped and least successful war movie of 2006, lagging far behind Flags of Our Fathers, Letters from Iwo Jima, Annapolis, and others in the same genre. But don't let this fool you, this was a good movie, fun to watch and engaging the entire way. The movie begins by showing how the various Americans joined the war before their own country. The movie then progresses to show their training, and troubles both in and out of the cockpit. Finally comes the dogfights, of which there are several. One dogfight occurs around a zeppelin, another occurs over a trench battlefield, and another occurs over fields and forests. The dogfights themselves were very realistic, and the only miss of detail is that all the pilots landed looking just as good as when they took of, even though they sat in open air cockpits. It seems hair gel was standard treatment for WWI pilots.For a war movie, it has all the generic subplots; the romance between a local girl and the group's brooding conscious, the doomed hero, the silent villian, the spoiled rich kid who does good, and the over eager chap who losses his nerve, only to gain it back at the end. No surprises here, though still a good story.",

    "review/text": "Jake Scott, son of Ridley, directed this grand tale of gentlemen bandits set in the mid 18th century. Even in the opening frames you can see he has a flare for his father's way of making things look. The sets, costumes and sense of framing all look much like something Ridley would have put together.Quite simply put, Johnny Lee Miller plays a threadbare \"gentleman\" cooling his heels in a cell on a charge of drunkenness. The cell door is demolished by a wheel which has come off a coach as it is being robbed by one Robert Carlyle. The two meet and begin a life of crime that entails robbing the rich and giving it to.....well....themselves. The idea is to garner enough wealth to start a new life in America. During an early robbery, Miller encounters Liv Tyler and it's love at first sight. Can he complete his plan with his partner AND bring Liv into the picture?This is a gorgeous movie. Every frame is a feast for the eyes. Maybe too much so. It's not until the second half that we start to get a feel for the characters. Prior to that everyone is swallowed up by the sets and costuming. The story is good enough. The robberies could have been more clever I suppose but they're not bad. And you do get to like those you are to like and hate those you are to hate. But this packs a lot of energy. It also has a lot of anachronisms in costuming and in the soundtrack. Maybe not quite as much as \"A Knight's Tale\" but enough to endear it to a younger crowd. It also has a good cast. Along with the above mentioned,you have Michael Gambon, Ken Scott and Tommy Flanagan, all turning in good performances. Jake Scott only has one other feature film under his belt which makes this a bit of an oddity. But as a first shot he's done a great job.This is a lot of fun. It won't change your life but it's well worth the time it takes to view it.",

Through rather interesting turns of events, they stumble on a fortune while in prison, are released and re-establish themselves as upstanding members of upper crust society in need of a prodigious income to support their lifestyle. Of course they become the most notorious highway robbers in all of England by holding up mostly wealthy nobility as they travel about in carriages at night.

Reuniting Carlyle (who charmed the world in *The Full Monty*) and Miller, who appeared together in *Trainspotting*, it is a somewhat disjointed affair that can be a pleasure to watch, nonetheless. With spectacular art direction, and some dazzling effects, the camerawork can be dizzying as well as captivating. Scott interjects certain modern elements of music and cinematic that can have a jarring effect in this period piece. Aside from a deplorable title (the name sounds too much like *Tango and Cash* or *Turner and Hooch*), this tale of an ill-matched pair of highwaymen, as lush and romantic as it is, leaves something to be desired. With elements of *Robin Hood*, *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid*, as well as *Batman*, it is an ambitious undertaking.The leads seem to do their best, and are engaging as the rogues, but the story rapidly becomes preposterous and you often find yourself wondering if you missed something. Then there's Liv Tyler. What can we say about Liv? That she's very good for her age? That someday she may be a fine actress? The truth of the matter is, that except for her lineage (such as it is), she is only one of the flood of lovely and somewhat inept starlets that have had a brief moment of attention lately. Always a pleasure to look at, she would do well to introduce a new facial expression (or two) into her repertoire. Alan Cumming, who won the Tony for his portrayal of the emcee in *Cabaret*, is flamboyantly superb as Lord Rochester, Claire Rushbrook has a gem of a role as the wealthy and syphilitic Lady Estelle, and Ken Stott is despicable as the sadistic chief of police. Shot in Prague, Spain and London, the locations serve the film perfectly, but the pop-synth music is at odds with the period, and even though it occasionally adds excitement, overall, it's distracting. Not a bad debut, overall, and a hint of the surprises Scott has in store for us.",

Maybe it's because I can accept it now for what it is: A movie designed for mindless fun, with no pretention toward anything else.

In fact, I neglected to mention him as one of the perks of the movie when I reviewed &quot;Ravenous&quot;. The part of Will Plunkett is one that he plays with relish and realism. He and Jonny Lee Miller's Macleane have a love/hate relationship from the start, but somewhere along the way a real friendship develops. They form a partnership in which Macleane, an upper-class clergyman's son fallen on hard times, finds out where the rich pickings are. Then, as the &quot;Gentleman Highwayman&quot;, he and Plunkett &quot;rob the rich...and that's it.&quot;The supporting cast features: Ken Stott, as an absolutely despicable adversary; Liv Tyler (one of the few weak spots in the film, in my opinion; she's pretty but her character lacks depth); and a thoroughly delicious Alan Cumming. Perhaps Cumming is getting a bit typecast (he played the same sort of role in &quot;Titus&quot;), but he's just so good at it!Several reviewers have already mentioned the ball scene with the techno-electronica music. It's surprising, but it works. Think of &quot;Orlando&quot;, another movie that took an unorthodox approach to score music. At times this movie is like a long version of the Adam Ant video &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, and parts of it are anachronistic, but it's a LOT of fun.",

They strike up a partnership. Robert Carlysle seems closest to normal in this movie as you're ever going to get but is still charming. Johny Lee Miller has had some lucky casting decisions and some rather unfortunate roles but he's definitely watchable. There's a love story, political intrigue and scenes lifted directly from Westerns but it's all very serviceable.You might want to rent this movie before buying it, but it is definitive enjoyable fluff and you should watch it if you find yourself bogged down with serious movies like The Pianist or The Hours.Did I mention that Alan Cummings steals every scene that he's in?",

There's nothing really original about this film, but it is fun to watch and shows promise for Jake Scott as a director. It doesn't aspire to greatness, so it's easy to grant a little leeway.You probably won't find anybody saying that it's the best movie they've seen but they certainly won't say that it's awful.The DVD is a bit weak on added features - the featurette does not include anything that you couldn't really get out of the movie on your own.

    "review/text": "Plunkett & Macleane caught me by surprise. The trailer opened with typical period drama pretentiousness before turning into a punkish, rebellious wild ride. When I went to see it at the cinema (during its extremely limited theatrical run) I hadn't even planned on it that day. I just turned up in time and decided to take a chance. A wise choice indeed, as I was in a bad mood that day and this movie really cheered me up.It's London, it's 1748, Robert Carlisle and Johnny Lee Miller play the titular highwaymen from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Will Plunkett brings the highway know-how while Captain James Macleane makes the connections to high society. Lord Gibson takes personal offense to their antics after being robbed, but her Niece Lady Rebecca (the lovely Liv Tyler) falls in love with Macleane, and his unusual gentlemanly ways. Ken Stott plays the truly vile Chance, the police inspector determined to see the men hang at any cost, and one of the nastiest villains in recent film history.Jake Scott (son of Ridley, nephew of Tony) directs with a style that fuses Gothic tones with post-modernism. This is no Pride and Prejudice. Plunkett & Macleane is glam rock on acid while retaining all of the usual gritty, earthy production designs of previous Ridley/Tony films. Amazingly, Jake Scott would not direct another film until 11 years after this got released.There is a strange rumor persistent on the Internet that Plunkett & Macleane (inspired by true story, don't you know) began life as a completely different film. I recall seeing production stills in magazines in 1996 (three years before its release), and there have been suggestions that it was originally called 'The Lady Highwayman' with Liv Tyler as the lead and Carlisle and Miller merely as supporting characters. The original screenplay by Selwyn Roberts apparently featured bizarre mathematical subtext before being heavily re-written by Bond-scribes Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. I'm not sure if any of the original material made it into the final, 99-minute, cut of the film.A score by Trevor Jones was also apparently rejected in favor of Craig Armstrong. While I have no idea what Jones may or may not have recorded for this film, there is no doubt that Armstrong's work is utterly amazing, probably his career best.Plunkett & Macleane seems to have fallen into obscurity since its release. Don't let it pass you by though, it's loads of fun and deserved a wider audience.",

Miller finds time along the way to fall head over heels (who wouldn't?) for lucious Liv Tyler, as the daughter of a bigwig Chief Justice. That's about as complicated as the cartoonish plot gets, but Scott directs with infectious energy and a bit of a wink at the audience, so you may find yourself entertained in spite of a rather thin narrative. If you are the scholarly type who likes to nitpick at historical inaccuracies-you'd best steer clear of this one...if the 18th century characters spouting Tarantino style dialogue doesn't make you crazy, the incongruous music soundtrack is sure to put you over the edge (no harpsichords or minuets were harmed in the making of this film).

    "review/text": "For those of us looking for a different kind of adventure, Plunkett &amp; Macleane fits the bill. I wasn't sure what to expect beyond the known premise of this being the story of notorious 18th century English highwaymen. What I discovered in my first viewing was not only the talents of the cast, but a visual feast as well. Updated with modern &quot;slang&quot;, an uptempo soundtrack (that cleverly mixes the relevant classical fare with modern electronics), and authentic looking costumes and scenery, this one swept me away to another time and place. Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller make a great team (again, as in &quot;Trainspotting&quot;) as the title characters, and display versatility in each of their roles....from the funny moments weaved throughout, to the dire consequences of their characters' actions, and finally to the loyalty of friendship. Liv Tyler, who's role as Lady Rebecca is not as dimensional as the leads, pulls it off well enough. All in all, I was pleased with this film, even with any minor flaws it contains (all being more in form with the sometimes uneven pace of the story, rather than the acting itself). Stereotypes do abound (esp. the artistocrats)in this movie, as do some gruesome violence, which could have both perhaps been a little less exaggerated. But, who's perfect? Finally, though Plunkett &amp; Macleane is not the type of film everyone will enjoy, those of us with a taste for scoundrels' adventures long ago will find it generally satisfying.",

This movie is not sophomoric.This has to be one of the most maturely realised and under-recognised films in recent film history. To whatever extent there is a modernism in the styling of the characters, there is also a remarkable restraint and authenticity in portraying the psychological tone of the time - in every social class and role, and the subtleties as well as the vulgarities of the social interactions. Read up on the period. This was SPOT ON. Affected Dandies did exist. The f**k word was absolutely in common usage. This film may be a lot more accurate than us moderns may want to admit.The cinematography is consistently superb. The acting and character development almost exceptional.

    "review/text": "A mediaeval costume dram with a notable difference - twentieth century speak transposed to the 18th century in this visually satisfying and atmospheric tale of two gentlemen highwaymen who robbed from the rich aristocracy for their kicks! But the dialogue and the loud thumping techno music gives it an appeal to the older teenage generation who might not appreciate it if it were done in the style of, say, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK. The highway robbery scenes are superbly done, Robert Carlyle and Jonny(LOVE HONOUR AND OBEY) Lee Miller relish their roles, acting as frivolously and as over the top as they can! Liv Tyler wears some particularly busty costumes as well. Filmed in London, Czech republic and Spain for the mediaeval building settings of old London and Newgate prison, this action-packed drama is best enjoyed on DVD for its soundtrack and atmospheric effects.

    "review/text": "The first time I saw this film, I was deeply confused. Just what was up with the costumes? And the music? The second time through, when I actually watched the screen instead of the sewing machine, it made so much more sense. Aha! They weren't goign for accuracy at all! I can go with this, support it even, despite the fact that I am one of the biggest costume snobs I've ever met. Just go with it.The biggest thing I noticed was that the only ones that got the seriously wrong costumes were the highest, smartest set, the ones that knew the rules and broke every one of them. In every part of their lives. I actually saw it as a way of pointing out to a population that probably would have seen truly accurate costume as merely quaint or stuffy, and that was not the attitude these people had. So you add a few modern touches, and really, it doesn't detract from the general mood they're trying to convey.The same thing kind of applies to the music, but you know, it's really just a good soundtrack. Apparently, baroque and techno can do quite well together, and have a lot of fun in the process. I'm still upset that the jail scene song isn't on the CD though.I find it deeply, terrribly funny that Alan Cummings' part bore the name of Rochester. The only other infamous Rochester I can think of was a 17th century poet who wrote the dirtiest, most obscene, most openly bi-sexual lyrics I've read that date to before the 20th century. So the eyebrow piercing was maybe a little much, but hey, it looked just swell on him with those incredible coats.Plot? Who needs plot? Seriously though, there was one. It's just a very, very common one. Think Robin Hood, or pirates, or simply highwaymen. They all have the same plot, and it never goes out of style. There's a reason for that--it's all great fun, and sometimes you get a moral, sometimes you don't, and sometimes they dance the Tyburn Jig and all the pretty ladies weep. It all amounts to the same thing.The point is always just to have fun, and a good laugh.",

They go on a crime spree and become well known. Chance makes it a personal point of honor to catch them.The action was good, the characters were superb, the villan was evil and mean.

    "review/text": "When he was young, Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) used to play hockey but when he blows a really big game, he quits. Now thirty, he's a lawyer who doesn't know anything about fair play or teamwork. When he gets arrested for drunken driving, he has to perform community service. And not just any community service, he has to coach hockey to kids! His team consists of Charlie Conway (Joshua Jackson), Greg Goldberg (Shaun Weiss), Dave Averman (Matt Doherty), Peter (J.D. Daniels), Gee Germaine (Garette Ratliff Henson), Jesse Hall (Brandon Quintin Adams), Connie Moreau (Marguerite Moreau), Dave Karp (Aaron Schwartz), and Terry Hall (Jussie Smollett). And they are an AWFUL team! Bombay hates the kids and doesn't try hard to coach them, and so of course the kids don't respect or like him at all. Will they ever be able to work as a team with Coach Bombay acting like the good coach he should be? And will they have enough time to make it to the finals against unbeatable team, Hawks? Also starring is Hans (Joss Ackland), Mr. Ducksworth (Josef Sommer), Fulton Reed (Elden Henson), Tammy (Jane Plank), and Tommy (Danny Tamberelli), Coach Reilly (Lane Smith), and Adam Banks (Vincent Larusso).Great movie entertainment! I just love the whole Mighty Ducks trilogy! They teach great values about trust, teamwork, fair play, and as Coach Bombay used to say, 'all that other junk'. It's also very, VERY hilarious! Some parts you can just die laughing, for example when the kids get in trouble from the principal and are put under detention. The hockey games are pretty suspenseful and fun, too!But there is a reason for the PG rating for this movie. Mostly it's because of language which at times is pretty bad. Also the kids in the movie are pretty naughty at times. I think the movie is best aimed for kids maybe 10 and up, great for adults, too.Then of course there are the other two \"Mighty Ducks\" films. \"D2: The Mighty Ducks\" have Bombay again coaching the Ducks, this time there are going up against the world as Team USA! Some of the hockey players aren't in this movie, but they get some new teammates. In my opinion (though it's a very hard choice), this movie is the best of all three. \"D3: The Mighty Ducks\" has the Ducks getting a scholarship for Eden Hall academy. Their main adversary are the Warriors, the varsity team of Eden Hall. If you liked the first \"Mighty Ducks\", I highly recommend the next two sequels! I sincerely hope that Disney will have the whole trilogy on DVD soon!",

He loved the movie and so on his birthday we got him this DVD.Big mistake. I have NEVER seen a DVD of such terrible quality. On widescreen HDTV the aspect ratio is all off so that there is big black lines on not just the sides of the screen but also the top and bottom... the movie takes up barely half of the TV screen! If that was the only issue we could have dealt with it, but the quality of the picture itself is just so horrible it's distracting. It's discolored, it's grainy, it looks like it's being projected out terribly old poor quality film projector.My nephew is only 6, so obviously he doesn't care much about video fidelity but it was so bad it even bothered him and he was asking what was wrong with the movie. We transferred the DVD to a Standard definition tube tv and the poor quality was not as noticeable, but still really bad.The quality was so terrible I was sure I had accidentally ordered a bootleg or something... but no, it's the authentic Disney DVD. I can't believe the quality.So regardless of what you think of this movie, stay away from this DVD, I can't exaggerate how bad the quality is.",

    "review/text": "I just love THE MIGHTY DUCKS flicks! I think they are some of the best flicks in the sports genre. This is the first in the saga. Emilio Estevez plays a hotshot, wise-cracking lawyer named Gordon Bombay. Bombay hates hockey and kids, even though he used to play hockey as a kid (that's one of the reasons why he hates both hockey and kids). When Bombay gets busted by the cops for drunk-driving, he has to be suspended from his career and do community service - particularly by coaching the &quot;District 5&quot; PeWee hockey team in Minnisota, where he lives.Bombay first thinks the job of coaching the kids will be easy...since he thinks he knows all about hockey. But when he first meets the kids, he realizes that it's going to be a lot harder than he thought - the kids are wise-cracking, rough, street kids like him who are absolutely HORRIBLE at hockey! The kids all hate him; he hates them, too. And they can't win any games. But then, he learns how to be a good coach and the kids begin to like him. Of course, you'll probably guess who will win the big play off championships - their rivals happen to be the team that Bombay played on as a kid and their coach was Bombay's old coach.Even though the plot is pretty predictable, it's still an awesome movie. And the plot is, in some way, different and unique than many others like it. The movie has a lot of hilarious parts in it. This is the kind of flick you can watch over and over again and never get bored of it. It's a great movie and another winner for Disney! Go buy it - the price is great!",

The Bad News Bears!The plot is pretty basic. An ex-hockey player turned hot-shot lawyer is forced to coach a losing hockey team made up of misfits. AFter some personality changes in the coach, he finds that hockey is still his thing and that he wishes to bring them to victory.It's full of fun moments and you get to see a young Joshua Jackson before his Dawson Creek days or his appearance in Urban Legends! And I hate to admit this, but Emilio Estevez does a decent job. I think most of us are used to seeing Estevez as Billy the Kid in Young Guns and it's hard to imagine him in any other role. Especially a parental role!This movie is a stepping stone for the next two that appear (But not on DVD?!?!). The next one is even more exciting (MIghty Ducks2-D2) with new players and a very cool storyline. By the 3rd movie, it's hard to believe they are high school and not college and you also get to see them grow up a bit.The Mighty Ducks trilogy is a great set of films and not quite as mindless as the rest of the Disney fare available.",

In my opinion, it is the roughest and most talent demanding sport in today's society, but also the least publicized and most enjoyable. A group of kids can do something right if they really want to and are willing to give it 110. Not only is this fun to watch, it sends a positive message out to all.

    "review/text": "Okay, so we all know the story about how the Ducks come from behind to win and how Coach Bombay gets revenge on his old coach for many years of bad memories.Fair enough.As corny and as thin as the plot can be at times, it's still a great story with good morals. It's definitely no Hoosiers or Rudy by a longshot, but it's Disney at it's best. It's a classic Disney sports movie as well as a great family film.Now, the DVD. Let's just say that I sure didn't buy this movie for the special features. There's a menu screen with a chapter search and that's about it.Ohh, one more thing. Whenever they re-released the film for DVD, I guess they must have inserted Queen's \"We Are The Champions\" and \"We Will Rock You\" into portions of the film and at the end credits. One thing in particular that kinda bugged me is that fact that the original score by David Newman is replaced by Queen's \"We Are The Champions\" right at the part where Charlie scores the winning penalty shot. It's not that Queen's song wouldn't be fitting here. I just felt that the original score added a lot of emotion within the film. Not a huge deal. I just didn't remember that the last time I saw the movie on VHS.Ahh well. I guess for $8 I really can't complain.",

    "review/text": "I somewhat doubt there will be a 4th Mighty Ducks movie. Think about it, there hasn't been a mighty ducks out since 1996. This was the first of three Mighty Ducks movies to come out. Gordon Bombay was a pee-wee hockey player up until he qutis when he misses a pentiity shot. And about 20 to 25 years later he is a lawyer (who claims he never loses) but he doresn't count a case when he scored with a reporter. His rival is Frank Hundy (Steven Brill) and he decides in a case to pretend to have a meeting with his client when he just wants to keep them waiting. But then Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) is arrested for drinking and dvring. Where in a case where he denfes fimself that the judge finds out that Gordon has trouble with the law. And his boss (Josef Soommer) decides to keep him on play roll but suspend his divers lience and orders Gordon to 500 hours of commuity servce coaching pee-wee hockey. He hates hockey and he doesn't like kids. His first game is against he old pee-wee team (the Hawks) coached by his old Hawks coach Jack Reilly (Lane Smith). If you like this how about you watch the 2nd Mighty Ducks movie.",

His assignment is to fill in as the interim hockey coach for a local group of underachieving kids. Coach Bombay, a former hocky star in the same league years earlier, has inherited the worst team in the league. Can he harness their rebellious attitudes and turn them into contenders? Maybe even make them good enough to challenge the perennial champions and his old coach?Formulamatic but lots of fun anyway. Estevez is surrounded by a strong cast with: Lane Smith as Coach Reilly, Heidi Kling as Casey Conway, Joshua Jackson as Charlie Conway and Marguette Moreau as Connie.",

My sons watched this too many times when they were 4-6 years old and I am convinced this had a significant impact on them learning to love the game of hockey. I know that sounds corny but it is true. My oldest is now playing hockey in college and my younger son is playing in high school & club. Good clean movie. I bought these two copies for two friends of mine who have younger sons interested in the game. Hopefully it will impact them like it did ours. GO DUCKS!",

    "review/text": "If you're looking for a good hockey movie that the kids can actually watch, this Disney vehicle starring Emilio Estevez is actually pretty decent. Estevez plays hotshot Minnesota lawyer and former youth hockey star Gordon Bombay, who gets popped for DUI and sentenced to community service. His assignment: Coach a hapless youth hockey team made up of misfits from the wrong side of the tracks. It's been called \"The Bad News Bears on skates,\" but The Mighty Ducks is a little too saccharine for the comparison. If you can get past that (and all the shameless tie-ins to the NHL franchise Disney once owned) there's some good hockey action and positive messages about sportsmanship, teamwork, believing in yourself and coming to grips with past mistakes. Especially in the final scenes, when the unheralded Ducks play for the league championship against their arch-rivals, the Hawks, a team led by Bombay's ruthless former coach. (Avoid the movie's two sequels, which don't measure up.)",

It really shows how talented Ricky is, to all you non-believers: he's much more than a pretty face believe me! He dances non-stop all the time and sings both his English hits Livin' la vida loca, She's all.., Shake your bon-bon and Spanish hits such as Mar&iacute;a, Copa de la vida and Lola, Lola plus a great trio with Santana and Jos&eacute; Feliciano. And this is what I really like about this VHS/DVD: You can really see him up close, the cameras aren't swinging back and forth and up and down or focusing on the audience, they're on Ricky 95% of the time! The sound is very good so the power in the drums and the horns (the band is great!) and of course in Ricky's voice comes very well across. I also like the short bits in between the songs which show Ricky singing with little kids or walking the streets of Puerto Rico. And it doesn't hurt to see him in those Armani outfits, Oh my GOD! If you really like Kiki but are afraid of buying VHS/DVD with bad quality, don't be afraid about this one because this tape is as good as it gets. BUY IT NOW!",

Ricky did a great performance with his unique and wonderful dancing and of course his lovely BIG smile. The special minutes with Jose Feliciano and Santana was a sweet moment also. His explanation about his country and earlier career with rare footage was impressive. I think this must be even better than the previously released DVD(&quot;Video Collection&quot;).The video/audio quality is great. One disappointment is that the running time is too short(only 45min).

I'm really glad that I didn't.I saw this live on my old television set, but since my new HDTV and 5.1 Surround Sound purchase, I wanted to view it on DVD. The quality of the video and audio is outstanding, and it really gives you the feeling that you are on the front row of a live concert in New York City.The background for this concert is the New York City Skyline with the Twin Towers in all their glory. Time of day changes with the beginning songs in full daylight and continuing as the sun sets and the skyline becomes beautifully lighted. There's a couple of songs with legends Jose' Feliciano and Carlos Santana and Ricky sings all of his upbeat easy to dance to latin hits. But my personal favorite is his love ballad, &quot;She's all I Ever Had&quot;.It ends up with a fireworks display out in the harbor but the real fireworks happen on stage. He's one of very few singers who can actually dance as well as sing. And even though my last name is Martin, I'm not related to Ricky in any way (wish I were). So if you like his music buy this one.

He loves Elmo, the firefighters, and even the \"fillers\" that other reviewers aren't too pleased with.This dvd is for the entire family -- we can all learn something here.While some reviewers think that 2 yrs. old is far too young, I disagree. With repeat viewings, and there have been many of them, my son, realizes that with fire comes the fire fighters who will keep us all safe, warm, and fuzzy -- Sort of like Elmo.Elmo is very scared after the grease fire at Hooper's store. His raw emotion of fear truly chokes me up. Never before has a muppet had such an impact on me or my son. Frankie, my son, always points out to me, \"he's scared\". So, not only is he learning fire safety, but he learning emotion and how to figure out how someone is feeling.Then after Firefighter Bill takes Elmo around the firehouse, Frankie is relieved to see Elmo back to his usual cute self, playing with the firetrucks like any other kid.NYFD does an outstanding job helping Sesame Street viewers and residents how to handle the situation should a fire happen. They were very reassuring and were genuinely concerned about Elmo.I think this is a perfect addition to fans of Elmo, and fans of Fightfighters. There is a sequence of \"elmo's World\", some other little cartoons and a video with the 3 little pigs and the big bad wolf called, \"get out stay out don't you go back in!\" and little ones get their turn to show us what firefighters wear and how they feel about them. Mr. Noodles sister comes for a silly visit and figures out what the fighter of the flames must wear to be safe. Also, a beautiful girl and close friend of Elmo's, Sabrina, shows us all her family's plan in case of fire.My son adores the whole dvd, even the silly Baby bear \"hero Guy\" that the movie ends with.",

    "review/text": "This video is very educational. It does start off with a smoke fire in which Elmo gets very scared and begins to shake. This can be scary for a child and I would recommend watching it with your child. (My son is 19 months old and did not find it scary, but he is still very young)It is very realistic and shows children what it would be like if there was ever a fire. It is wonderful and teaches childrn all about firemen and the firehouse and what to do in case of a fire. There are cute songs that teach fire safety, like \"Get out, stay out, don't you go back in\". Another excellent lesson is that children should not hide from the firemen. In the event of a real fire a child will be terrified and may mistake the fireman for a monster. This movie explains that firemen are there to help and not to be affraid of them.I don't agree that it should only be shown to children over 3 or 4, because you cannot guarantee your children will not experience a fire before that time. Heaven forbid there is a fire and they are not prepared. Although this movie is a little scary, I think it is definitely worth watching with your child. I think ever house should have a fire plan and discuss fire safety, and this movie helps bring the topic to a toddler's level. After all, the more prepared you are for a fire, the better chance of getting out alive.",

He begs for me to put this in every day. He was not afraid at all in the beginning when Elmo shakes. They do show Elmo very afraid, but the adults in the DVD really do everything to make him feel better and let him explain his feelings. There are catchy songs and good fire safety information. You should preview this DVD and judge for yourself if your child is to sensitive for the part where Elmo shakes in the beginning. If you feel that part is to scary for your child then skip to the next chapter of the DVD. It's a small part of the DVD and the rest of the DVD has so much educational material. I highly recommend this DVD.",

    "review/text": "I'll admit I almost didn't buy this for my then 2 year old son because of some of the comments about Elmo being too scared. I'm so glad I didn't listen and bought it anyway! My husband is a firefighter and EMT and my son is enchanted with anything firefighters. The video does a great job of teaching children what to do when there is a fire without being too preachy. Yes, Elmo is scared at the beginning--he was in a very scary situation, but the adults and firefighters are there to make him feel better and by the end he is the happy Elmo we all know. I watched it with my son the first time, and he was not scared at all. He is almost 4 now and this is still one of his favorite DVD's. The lessons are timeless and the video does a great job of showing the kids all about firefighters and how to stay safe when there is a fire. My husband uses clips of it when he goes into schools during Fire Prevention Week. I am a teacher, but I teach Middle School, so this video is not appropriate. However, if I taught younger kids I would definately use it.",

    "review/text": "What is up with some of you people going on about how awful it is that Elmo is scared in this DVD. Yeah, he should be. He is in a restaurant when a FIRE starts. That is the whole idea here. Kids should know FIRES are dangerous. My 3 year old loves firefighters. He has 5 fire trucks, a firefighter outfit, a hose, 3 hats and lots of video/DVDs about firefighters. He is a firefighteroholic but, he also appreciates that FIRE is very dangerous and not something that's fun and yippee! On the first viewing of this DVD he turns to me and says, \"Papa, Elmo Scared\", and I tell him, \"Yes he is son because, he is in a restaurant that has a lot of smoke coming out of the kitchen. And he is not sure what is going on\". On the arrival of FDNY Elmo, still shaking, is slowly reassured that it is ok to be scared about FIRE and that it is also understandable that the firefighters in all their uniforms can be scary as well. Elmo is then invited back to the firehouse to see what a firefighter does and look at all the gear they need. At the end of the firehouse tour Elmo is no longer scared. So, if you want a good DVD about the dangers of FIRE and what a child should do when a FIRE starts in their presence this is a great DVD to purchase but, if you want your child to live in a dream world where everything is fun and sweet and good enough to eat, stay away from this DVD.",

This video combines two of my three year old daughters great loves Elmo and fire trucks! A can't miss combination. The video starts with a fire at my Mr. Hooppers store. The fire fighters come to put the fire out and everything is fine but the fire makes Elmo sad and worried. I watched this part with my daughter the first few times. She tends to get upset if she sees Elmo upset but she was fine when she got to see that everything turns out okay. To help Elmo conquer his fear the fire fighters invite Elmo to the station to see what they do. The video is packed with great fire safety tips the most important being that if there is a fire your child should not be sacred of the firefighter and should run towards them. It may seem simple advice but it was something I hadn't ever thought to talk to my daughter about. This video can spark important fire safety discussions with your child. The video continues with a firefighter episode of Elmo's world. There is also a segment of Baby Bear's Hero Guy. The fire fighters used in this video are ones from New York City. I always get a little teary eyed when I see them in this video. I can't help but think of September 11th and how three hundred and thirty four fire fighters heroically gave their lives. I find the scene where Elmo asks them if they ever get scared especially poignant. Thankfully my daughter is too young to understand the horror of September 11th and she justs enjoys this videos with the innocence of a child. This is a wonderful video and a great tribute to fire fighters. May god bless and protect the firefighters everywhere.",

I think with Elmo showing he is scared, they are invited to share their scared feelings. Its brief and once Elmo starts meeting more firemen and seeing the firehouse he begins to feel better. It's a great springboard for talking about other feelings besides happy happy joy joy- AND a great start to talking about serious situations. Just as entertaining as other Elmo videos and quite possibly less annoying, than others, for adults. (I don't care for the voice of 'waddle waddle hop hop' and 'itsy bitsy spider')",

    "review/text": "My toddler and kindergarten age sons both love firefighters, and this video helped them learn about fire safety in the happy confines of Elmo's world. The fire in Hooper's Store was a tad scarier than I thought it would be, but I think it received the seriousness it deserved. My boys were concerned, but seeing Elmo handle his fears was reassuring. Also, they love to sing the fire safety songs, and know to \"get low and go\" in the event of a fire. We own the video, and I plan to get the DVD as well; a very worthwhile video.",

    "review/text": "This is a very well done educational (IMHO) DVD. Elmo DOES become scarted, and your child might be scared a bit while watching it, but fire is scarey and it isn't a bad thing to see Elmo scared. Maria is there with him all along, and mom or dad should be with the child when first viewing this DVD...we used this as a spring board to talk about good fires (to cook with, fireplaces etc) and bad fires. Kids even in day cares have fire drills, so they aren't as sheltered as most parents think when it comes to fire. But, having a plan in YOUR home is something that everyone should TAKE time to make. This DVD helps open the door to conversation, and helps kids not be afraid of the firefighter suits. A good point is made, the firefighter tells Elmo even if the firefighter looks scarey, he is there to help, and if in a fire go to the firefighter not away. I also like the \"get low and go\" tag line it helps us all remember to Get low and Go!",

He puts on his firehat and plays with his firetruck while watching the video. Absolutely the best. Keeps him entertained the entire show. It also teaches great lessons of to get out of a building when it is on fire and to stay out. It teaches that although firefighters may look scary they are there to help you. It also teaches that firefighters don't just put out fires but also help the injured and rescue animals. All in all one of the best videos I have purchased.",

However, this DVD is probably intended for kids that are a little older than 3 and can understand more complex subject matter than the usual Elmo's World format. One thing we love about the \"usual\" Elmo format is that any age can enjoy and really learn. Especially for us with kids under 2. This Firehouse series takes this subject very seriously. I am not saying we should not take fire's serious however, this is Elmo! Thank God that in the middle of this DVD there was the Elmo's World format that we are familar with...but at the beginning, you have a very serious incident with Hooper's Store and a fire. The music in the background was very foreboding as well..I could not tell if we were watching Elmo or an after-school special. I also felt that we were dupped by the producers use of a \"filler\" at the end of the DVD---Hero Guy. IF we wanted to watch \"Hero Guy\" we would of purchased that. Please don't place that on our beloved Elmo DVD's! Instead, the Elmo's World that we love is probably only about 18 min on this DVD...the rest is for older kids or just filler. I would buy other Elmo DVD's before this one if you have children under 3.",

Why they had to take such a great idea and ruin it is beyond me.

Yes, it does show Elmo afraid because a fire in Hooper's store (all they show is smoke coming from the back room due to a small grease fire). He's three years old, of course he's scared! BUT, that's the whole point of the DVD. After the fire, Elmo is invited to and visits the fire station where he talks to and learns about fire fighters, gets a tour of the fire station and learns what to do in case of a fire, and by the end of the DVD he's not scared anymore. It shows that fires don't need to be a scary thing as long as you know what to do. Has catchy songs that teach fire safety, and Elmo does a great job in showing other children that they don't need to be afraid if they know what to do. I think it does a GREAT job at teaching little ones fire safety!",

I watched it with her and even I found it entertaining, easy to learn and remember the notes on the staff and the positioning of the first 7 notes on the piano.I would love to get this in a series for my daughter to learn everything about music. It certainly makes it easy for anyone to learn but especially for young kids. Also the style of teaching allows you to watch it like a movie and remember the lessons for when you go on the piano at a later time. There is no need to have the piano in front of you while you learn.I highly recommend this DVD to all parents with young kids who are about to learn piano and music for the first time.",

    "review/text": "In 1864, Union cavalry Captain John Hayes (Randolph Scott) is commissioned to head up a new daily overland stage operation between California and Julesburg, Colorado, to bring both mail and gold east for the Union (yet for some reason the film is titled \"Westbound\"; I guess \"Eastbound\" wouldn't be a compelling title for a western). Hayes is very familiar with Julesburg, the place he lost his sweetheart Norma (Virginia Mayo) to hotel owner and local big man Clay Putnam (John Duggan). On arriving in town, he finds it to be full of Confederate sympathizers, chief among them Putnam and his gunslinging right-hand man Mace (Michael Pate), and he finds few sympathetic to his own cause besides one-armed soldier Rod Miller (Michael Dante) and his wife Jeanie (Karen Steele), and a few broken-down old drivers and sodbusters. Soon things turn violent, but will the town of Julesburg turn a blind eye because of it's southern sympathies, or will it end up supporting the honorable Hayes and his attempts to just run a stage line?The fourth of the seven collaborations between director Budd Boetticher and star Randolph Scott, WESTBOUND is generally considered the weakest, and was dismissed by the director himself as something that should have gone riding into the ocean. It's not that bad at all, though I suppose I'd agree with the conventional wisdom. The major problem is that the basic screenplay and story (by Berne Giler and Albert S. LeVino) just aren't that compelling; we've seen loads of town overlords who employ amoral gunslingers to do their dirty work, and neither Clay Putnam nor his wife are particularly well-developed. And the film rushes by in a way that belies the obviously fairly expensive (at least for Boetticher) production - it's glossy and beautifully photographed in very bright Technicolor (by J. Peverell Marley), and yet it feels undeveloped and far too short at 72 minutes to really explore some of the interesting underlying themes very much at all. One thing I liked is that there's a subtle contrast between the one-armed \"half a man\" Rod, and the weak and amoral Clay, and their marriages to strong women - but that doesn't really go anywhere, and Mayo in particular is underused.But as I say, the color is great - though I must mention that it's a bit TOO glossy overall, and this is one of those westerns where the women all look like they've come out of 50s glamour shoots - and Boetticher's shot selection and direction of actors is excellent all around. There are some memorable moments, like a 30-second street-level shot of several men moving towards a fallen and dying man, a stagecoach robbery that goes all wrong, and a stampede in the rain, and Boetticher manages to get a few of his typically terse and funny bits of dialogue in as well. And Scott is really quite good, dominating the action in a way he didn't always need to do - it's as if here he knows the material isn't that good, and so he steps it up a little bit. It's interesting to see him play a Union officer; I've seen him play Confederates several times, but I'm not sure I've seen him wearing the blue. The music by David Buttolph sounds like it could be from any western, it's just so...\"generic\"...but it's fine, if a little too lively for the dark turn the story ends up taking. And the ending of the film, with Scott in a rather ambivalent place as regards both of the main female characters, is kind of neat.This is a no-frills Warner Archive disc and as such the \"chapters\" are just breaks at each 10-minute mark, and there are no extras at all; but it plays fine, and the print is in good shape, and it's correctly presented at 1.85:1. Certainly nobody should be rushing to get this before they've got the first Boetticher/Scott collaboration,Seven Men From Nowor theThe Films of Budd Boetticherbox set containing the other five. But if you've got and love those, this film though just a bit less impressive, is essential.",

Although all seven are high grade, \"B\" westerns, this one is, IMO, the weakest of the bunch. Scott plays a Union officer ordered to return to his civilian job of running a stagecoach line that will be carrying regular shipments of California gold that is desperately needed to conduct the war against the Confederacy. The stage line is based in a town run by a man(Duggan) who is sympathetic to the South and is determined to stop the gold from getting into Union hands and divert it to the Confederate war effort. Mayo plays Duggan's wife, who once had \"a thing going on\" with Scott. Steele plays the widow of a disabled Union soldier who was murdered by a member of Duggan's gang. She agrees to help Scott run the stage line. Given the poor quality of her acting ability, her only apparent reason for being in the film is her ample bosom and to provide a \"wholesome\" love interest for Scott, who no longer has any feeling for Mayo. This is an \"okay\" film, but suffers when compared to the other \"Boetticher/Scott\" films in the cycle(IMO, the best of the lot is, \"7 Men From Now\", which features Lee Marvin in an early role as a terrific \"bad guy\").",

    "review/text": "In the larger pantheon of the western, THE GOLDEN STALLION (1949) may hold a status as a minor classic, but in the world of the B-western, it stands out as a masterpiece, arguably Roy Rogers' best film and certainly compelling viewing for anyone interested in a strong, simple story well told. This is the one where Roy goes to jail on a manslaughter charge rather than let his horse Trigger take the rap for the death of a bad guy (who'd been trying to steal a wild mare which fought back and then ran away).Roy's act saves Trigger's life but cannot prevent him from being auctioned off and purchased by a corrupt businessman who then uses Trigger in an elaborate diamond smuggling-across-the-Mexican border scheme. In the course of it all, Trigger mates with the runaway mare and fathers Trigger, Jr. Dale Evans plays a local ranch owner who writes to Roy in prison every week and helps him to clear his (and Trigger's) name. The musical numbers are not too intrusive and are enlivened by the presence of Estelita Rodriguez as Dale's South American gal pal, Pepe Valdez.This is the best-looking Trucolor print of a Roy Rogers western I've ever seen. The blues are typically strong, the reds look red (not orange) and, surprisingly, the green of the foliage is actually a dark forest green, not brown as it usually registered in Trucolor. (Trucolor was a two-color process used by Republic Pictures in lieu of the more expensive three-color Technicolor process.) There is a lot of beautifully-photographed horse action here, with Trigger sharing the spotlight not only with the mare sought after by the smugglers but also with Trigger Jr. If you're a fan of westerns devoted to horses, then this one's for you. I immediately thought of this film when I saw the 2002 animated release, SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON, and tried to think of an appropriate live-action western equivalent. It may not be an exact equivalent, but it offers some of the same kind of thrilling horse action.GOLDEN STALLION is the film Quentin Tarantino chose as the subject of the very first article in The New York Times' celebrated \"Watching Movies\" series, in which reporter Rick Lyman sits down with famed actors and directors to watch their selected favorite films. It was a bold choice and helped to call attention to the long career of the film's director, Republic Pictures' veteran action specialist, William Witney.",

The plot takes on more curly-cue twists than the designs on Roy's fancy saddle when the mare gives birth to Trigger Jr., and Trigger is taken by the thieves. Roy, finally out of jail, uses the colt to catch the bad guys and get Trigger back. If you're a real Trigger fan, don't miss 1946's My Pal Trigger, which follows the prized palomino from his birth through his first meeting with his pardner Roy. Another great Trigger movie moment is in 1952's Son of Paleface in which he costarred with comedian Bob Hope.Staci Layne Wilson",

Also, philosophy of the good, bad, and justice discussed sometime in a very advanced level. Another fact, forensic science enrollment increased after airing CSI.

Primarily I was compelled to question another reviewer's accusation that 4 &quot;reruns&quot; were included in this third season set. Where did he get THAT? If you check the season episode finder for the first two seasons, which the reviewer says he has, you'll find no such repeats. Has he been watching broadcast episodes and now calls them reruns? That's pretty funny!Anyway, this is a terrific set to continue the fascination most of us feel for the series! Buy it and enjoy.",

Created by Anthony Zuiker and executive produced by movie maven Jerry Bruckheimer, the thrilling series centers on the Las Vegas Police Department's night-shift forensics unit, which utilizes cutting-edge technology to solve the often grisly crimes of a glamorous city whose constant influx of visitors makes it rife with criminal elements. Quickwitted detective Gil Grissom (William Petersen) leads the highly-skilled investigative team that includes his single-mother partner, Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger); hair and fiber expert, Nick Stokes (George Eads); former gambling addict, Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan); and fresh-faced newbie, Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) with the help of tough-as-nails police captain, Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) and efficient lab coroner Dr. Al Robbins (Robert David Hall).Heavy on science, creative camerawork, and uncomfortably graphic depictions of violence, CSI is revered by fans and critics alike for its consistently gripping and well-written storylines, often inspired by real-life cases. This collection presents all 23 episodes from the series' third season.",

Superstar producer Jerry Bruckheimer's mega production values give the show a gloss that no other prime time TV drama has, and the cast is better than ever, with special nods going to Gary Dourdan and the gorgeous Jorja Fox. The ever growing plot twists in various episodes owe a huge debt to the early years of the long running Law &amp; Order, as C.S.I. finds ever growing greatness just as the aformentioned show did in it's prime years ago. Just as with the previous two C.S.I. season collections, Paramount has hardly assembled any extras for this set, which is yet again a major disappointment.

By the end of the season, Gil's hearing is addressed, more cases are solved and Greg (Eric Szmanda) is still trying to win a date with Sara. All in all, this has to be one of the best CSI seasons to date. With episodes like &quot;Fight Night&quot; and &quot;Blood Lust&quot; how can you go wrong by purchasing this set? A must for any CSI fan!",

    "review/text": "\"Whooooo are yo-ou o-ou?\" The best theme song of any show on TV is topped only by the actual quality of the show. Season 3 picks up just where season 2 left off, and doesn't miss a beat in terms of show or acting quality. Every episode of this show has me glued to the screen, and it doesn't stop here either (see season 4 and beyond).This show remains one of the top couple shows in the ratings, and has brought about a huge new interest in forensic science. Colleges across the country are starting new criminal science programs or increasing their existing ones. This show is not only incredibly interesting, but is also making an actual difference in the world. There are few shoes on TV today that can say that.William Petersen's acting is simply brilliant as Gil Grissim, and with marvolous support from actors and actresses like Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows), George Eads (Nick Stokes), Gary Dourdan (Warrick Brown), Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle), Paul Guilfoyle (Captain Jim Brass), and Eric Szmanda (Greg Sanders), the show can't (and doesn't in any way) miss. Do yourself a huge favor and pick it up today. It's a little pricey, but it's really worth every cent.",

    "review/text": "Much as I've enjoyed prior seasons of CSI, Season 3 sticks in my craw. Maybe I've had time to notice something that's always been there, or maybe it's a shift in the creative crew's vision, but this season is more cynical than past seasons. Some episodes seem downright misanthropic. And I'm not the only one who thinks this; if you listen to the commentary tracks, the commentators as good as admit it.Don't take me wrong. Several episodes maintain the spirit of scientific investigation that makes this show an audience favorite. Characters broaden out and deepen, making our heroes more than mere vehicles to deliver the plot. This is no longer a collection of loosely connected cop stories; CSI, with this season, fleshes out into a textured universe full of open-ended story arcs that hold the audience.But two episodes feature single mothers victimizing the rich, and these and other stories convey the message that the poor can't be trusted. Several episodes feature the early arrest of an ex-convict, followed by the evidence to justify the arrest, because hey, once a criminal, always a criminal, right? And several feature absolutely random and unjustified violence, with the message that you need to live in fear.Fans may say I'm reading too much into this. They may say that the murdering movie star or Sam Braun's overt corruption contradict my reading. I admit, the cynical aspects I find aren't monolithic. But that doesn't mean they aren't there. The message of this season seems to be that we ought to be scared of everyone around us, especially the weak and disfranchised, because they may turn on us at any minute.All this is on top of technology that increasingly looks less like Kojak and more like Captain Kirk; stories in which the guilty party is all too visible before the end of Act II; and romantic subplots that linger too long to be realistic. There are still episodes in this season that I like, which maintain the original spirit of the show, but they are getting lost in the crowd. A show that started well is turning into a mess.",

This has to be one of the best cast shows out there -- the chemistry between the CSIs is amazing, the story lines are fresh, and it has quickly become my favorite drama (with 24 being a VERY close second). Only one thing about the other reviews -- yes, Nick's character is gorgeous, but how about that Warrick? He's not what you might think of as movie star gorgeous, but there is something about him that is just absolutely amazing -- nice face, body -- everything. Grissom is also attractive because he's so intelligent and seems to know something about everything. Sara has a great voice, and well I could say something great about all of the character's physical qualities, but the most important thing is that the show is captivating, innovative, and fresh. Season after season, you're drawn into each and every story line. I love CSI and hope it stays on the air for another 10 years!",

I just spent the weekend watching this (Yes I know I need a life! : ), but I felt it was a weekend well spent.Even though C.S.I. had two plotlines that never worked in season three (Grissom's hearing loss, and Sara lusting over Grissom), this season contains some of the best C.S.I.'s yet. When the personal lives of the C.S.I's combine with the cases they are working on, you get some of the best acting out of this distinguished group of actors. The plotline of Eddie Willows' death, and how it effects Catherine is probably one of the most gripping ones of the season. Also, when Warrick puts his personal feelings for the victim, someone's daughter from his past, ahead of his criminalistic objectivity we see how fragile he really is.In most every C.S.I. episode, there is an &quot;A&quot; story and a &quot;B&quot; story. At times, you wish that the C.S.I. writers would use only one story at a time, as it could get confusing. But other then that, I cannot find any horrific flaws.Jerry Bruckheimer continues his reign as the modern day Jack Webb with his series &quot;Cold Case&quot;, and &quot;Without a Trace&quot;. The C.S.I. Miami and now New York series are watering down the name, but Bruckheimer continues to turn out hit after hit. Go with this C.S.I. season for a great DVD set.",

Like its first two years, season three was full of drama, mystery, and episodes that kept viewers on the edge of their seats.If season one introduced audiences to the world of forensic science and season two saw the characters become a bit more comfortable with each other, season three was full of action and character-driven drama previously unseen on the show. Gil Grissom (William Petersen) continued to struggle with his growing deafness and increasing chemistry with Sara; Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) managed to not only lose her ex-husband in a car accident but discover the identity of her father and blow up the lab. Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) learned that personal actions have consequences for the victims in his cases, Nick Stokes (George Eads) began his ongoing competition with Sara for Grissom's approval, and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) just plain had a bad year, from finding out she was her boyfriend's 'other woman' to nearly being killed in a lab explosion. Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda) continued on his quest to become a CSI, while Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) and Doc Robbins (Robert David Hall) continued to process some of Las Vegas's craziest.However, the personal dramas took a backseat to the reality of crime in Vegas as the nightshift continued to investigate some of the most compelling cases to date. 'The Accused is Entitled' featured a popular actor going up for murder and putting CSI on trial in the process (not entirely unlike what happened with OJ Simpson a decade earlier), 'Fight Night' took viewers into the underworld of boxing, and 'Inside the Box' combined the death of a police officer with mob ties and the high-stakes world of a casino mogul. In addition to these episodes, season highlights included 'The Execution of Catherine Willows', 'Random Acts of Violence', and the 90-minute episode 'Lady Heather's Box', a mini-movie that brought the return of infamous dominatrix Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) in a mystery so full of twists it will have you glued to your chair.In addition to all twenty-three season episodes, the DVD box set includes a tour of the police lab, a behind-the-scenes view of the writers' room, interviews with the cast, and episode commentaries full of information on how each episode comes together.Having passed the sophomore hurdle, in its third season, \"CSI\" proved that it was capable of delivering quality entertainment, and is still going strong.",

    "review/text": "Having absorbed the third season, it's amazing how this series continues to grow both dramatically and technically. In this season, apart from the usual puzzling crime scenes, the stars of the show find themselves in varying crises: Grissom's hearing loss gets worse and a decision must be made; Katherine's personal life undergoes a tragic change; Warrick finds himself involved in an internal affairs investigation; Sarah loses one love and contemplates a surprising replacement; Nick takes up a dangerous new hobby; and Brass continues to be his wonderfully sardonic self. We get dwarves, stand up comics, vigilantes, murderous actors and more. The cast as always is impeccable with William Petersen continuing to be the most complex character on television. Brilliant show just keeps getting better!",

I remember first seeing Petersen (Gil Grissom) in Manhunter (the first movie based on Thomas Harris' book the Red Dragon and the perfect movie adaptation of that book) when he was quite a bit younger and thinner but it is not his leading man qualities that make him so appealing.The writers/producers/directors of this series manage to recreate some of the things that make British crime dramas so fascinating-- they 1) don't pull away from the dark to contrive a happy ending; 2)they don't hesitate to portray the lead characters as vulnerable and \"strange\"; and 3) they look for really great faces, not conventionably pretty or ugly actor, for the parts.Sure, it's science fantasy in the sense that things don't happen in real life the way they happen in the CSI lab, and it's not great art, but its a great way to pass time.",

One of the best during the season. Two, Play with Fire, is the second best. (in my opinion)Maybe even the best episode, although, poor Greg! Anyway, season three is probably the 2nd best, (the second season is by far the best, the 1st season, they were just starting the show, so it's okay! But so far, the 4th season sucks....) Anyway, i highly recommend the 3rd season.....",

Yeah, but it's realism, they say.Another 'but' and a big one: just about all the viewers l know - friends, neighbors, co-workers - complain about the same thing: in the show, why is Marg Helgenberger all too often referred to as 'beautiful' or 'gorgeous' or 'lovely' when she is simply an ordinary-looking, run-of-the-mill actress with tight, low-cut clothing? Really! She hardly stands up to any lovely woman, so the question is: is she married to the producer or the Studio Head to get such unwarranted acclaim?",

Being a video freak I then started to take it back because I later discovered that it's not widescreen. I'm really glad that I didn't.I saw this live on my old television set, but since my new HDTV and 5.1 Surround Sound purchase, I wanted to view it on DVD. The quality of the video and audio is outstanding, and it really gives you the feeling that you are on the front row of a live concert in New York City.The background for this concert is the New York City Skyline with the Twin Towers in all their glory. Time of day changes with the beginning songs in full daylight and continuing as the sun sets and the skyline becomes beautifully lighted. There's a couple of songs with legends Jose' Feliciano and Carlos Santana and Ricky sings all of his upbeat easy to dance to latin hits. But my personal favorite is his love ballad, &quot;She's all I Ever Had&quot;.It ends up with a fireworks display out in the harbor but the real fireworks happen on stage. He's one of very few singers who can actually dance as well as sing. And even though my last name is Martin, I'm not related to Ricky in any way (wish I were). So if you like his music buy this one. You won't regret it.",

He dances non-stop all the time and sings both his English hits Livin' la vida loca, She's all.., Shake your bon-bon and Spanish hits such as Mar&iacute;a, Copa de la vida and Lola, Lola plus a great trio with Santana and Jos&eacute; Feliciano. And this is what I really like about this VHS/DVD: You can really see him up close, the cameras aren't swinging back and forth and up and down or focusing on the audience, they're on Ricky 95% of the time! The sound is very good so the power in the drums and the horns (the band is great!) and of course in Ricky's voice comes very well across. I also like the short bits in between the songs which show Ricky singing with little kids or walking the streets of Puerto Rico. And it doesn't hurt to see him in those Armani outfits, Oh my GOD! If you really like Kiki but are afraid of buying VHS/DVD with bad quality, don't be afraid about this one because this tape is as good as it gets. BUY IT NOW!",

Ricky did a great performance with his unique and wonderful dancing and of course his lovely BIG smile. The special minutes with Jose Feliciano and Santana was a sweet moment also. His explanation about his country and earlier career with rare footage was impressive. I think this must be even better than the previously released DVD(&quot;Video Collection&quot;).The video/audio quality is great. One disappointment is that the running time is too short(only 45min).

    "review/text": "The Valachi Papers was shot at a time when common wisdom had it that gangster pictures were box-office poison, so the very American tale of Charles Bronson's Cosa Nostra soldier spilling the beans on his life in the mob in return for protection by the Feds ended up being shot at Dinocitta in Italy with French money and an English director (Terence Young, reunited with Dr No villains Joseph Wiseman - wonderfully hammy here - and Anthony Dawson) only to end up being discounted as a Godfather ripoff when Coppola's film became a surprise huge hit. Based on Joe Valachi's Grand Jury testimony that lifted the veil on the way the mob worked and was organized after years of denial of its very existence by J. Edgar Hoover, it's a well-crafted and enjoyable saga with none of the operatic grandeur that Coppola, Leone and De Palma would bring to the genre. There's not much in the way of historical or social context, more a catalog of greatest hits and internecine feuding, but it's done with some flair and is surprisingly entertaining. Bronson makes a good lead, with decent support from Walter Chiari and Lino Ventura, both surprisingly well dubbed. Unfortunately the dire Mrs Bronson, Jill Ireland, is along too, but she's not in it enough to do any damage.",

    "review/text": "This movie is based on facts revealed by mob turncoat, Joseph Valachi, in 1963, and published as a book by Peter Maas (The Valachi Papers, same title as the movie).Although the movie is based on Valachi's story, at least one scene never took place in real life (otherwise it would've been mentioned in the book because it's so spectacular). That's the scene where Valachi's friend, 'the Gap' (real name, Dominick Petrilli), gets his penis cut off in Valachi's restaurant by mobsters and afterward asks Valachi to shoot him, which he does. Maybe the movie people thought they needed a scene like the horse head scene in 'The Godfather'.Too bad, because the rest of Valachi's story is true and inventing fictional scenes only compromises the authenticity of the story.It's a very good movie and it follows the book closely, but it could have been a great movie had they had a bigger budget and some famous actors to fill out the parts. That said, some of the actors did a great job, such as Joseph Wiseman (Salvatore Maranzano) and the guy who plays Valachi's sidekick, the Gap. Charles Bronson acts very well too, of course.If you like mob movies based on real life stories like 'Donnie Brasco', 'Goodfellers', 'Casino' etc.etc., then this movie is for you.If you liked the movie, you should read the book too! It's one of those books you can't put down before you have read all of it. You can buy it here on Amazon and it's fairly cheap.",

    "review/summary": "Not bad, but don't expect \"The Godfather\"",
    "review/text": "Having come out almost right after \"The Godfather\" (though the book came out much earlier), this movie tried to capitalize on Coppola's masterpiece and the publics' appetite for mob flicks, so it had big shoes to fill. By that comparison, it pales. On its own, it fits into the category of movies like, \"The St. Valentines Day Massacre.\" It leaves a little bit to be desired in performances (cerainly in brand name actors aside from Charles Bronson), dialogue and editing/continuity. But the story it tells is true, based on a book that by itself tells the story of a mobster turned informant because of the contract unjustifiably put on his head. The movie satisfies those who crave the ingredients offered in the mob genre- violence, hits, blood, betrayal, loyalty, misguided power hungry individuals, and mistrust. And it can be argued that the cast of largely unknown Italian actors lends a feel of authenticity to the movie. But it does come down to script, dialogue and what is done with it by those actors, and in that, though the movie is a guilty pleasure of mine, it does come up short. But it does detail the hierarchy of the mafia over several years, how that changed due to power struggles, and how it affected those who lived within it. Bronson's Valachi character is the sympathetic figure in this movie and the movie is told from his perspective and that of the FBI agent to whom he provides information- in violation of the oath of mob code of secrecy he's sworn to- in exchange for protection from his assailants (the agent being the only other familiar face in this movie- he from a late 60s/ early 70s police TV show, perhaps \"The Mod Squad\"). There is some unforgettable dialogue, but unlike \"The Godfather,\" it's for more forgetable reasons. Example? At the funeral of an executed mobster, his widow pleads to Salvatore Maranzano, the head of the mob at the time, to bring life back to her husband. Maranzano's reply? \"I no can bring back the dead. Only keel the living.\" That said, that's actually part of the appeal to this movie. It doesn't purport to be anything it isn't. On it's own devices this is an informative, if not entertaining movie. Not all mob movies, parcularly of this era or earlier, strived to the award winning excellence of \"Goodfellas,\" \"The Godfathers,\" even \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" or \"A Bronx Tale\"- movies where the dilogue is as vital as the action. In this movie, the dialogue merely pieces the story together, and not much more. Couple other points of note. Jill Ireland, Bronson's real life wife, plays his wife in this movie. And perhaps the most notable to those who are fans of this movie, the sight of the Twin Towers in the background during one scene, in a movie that takes place starting in the 30s. That aside, taken on its own merits, as far as mob movies from its period, this one ain't so bad, which I admit isn't exactly a ringing endorsement.",

Some of them are actually a bit tender.

Her mannerisms were so rigid and sharp. I came to wonder how she was able to play music with such finesse. Benot Magimel as Walter Klemmer was excellent. He was just the total opposite of Erika. I'm not quite sure if it is realistic to have that kind of young man be attracted to such a repressive woman. From the start I could not help but feel that the relationship would fail, as it did. Most will be fooled by the cover of the DVD box. The film is not sensual at all. It is incredibly awkward due to Erika's inability to express love and affection. This realization of Erika's unhealthy psychological problems does not doom upon her until Erika goes into a fit of rage. Erika hits her elderly mother as well as attempts to make out with her. Erika is so confused in how to express her feelings. She had been anti-social for a long time. I wasn't surprised about her revealed fetishes. I always thought strict instructors had hidden eccentric oddities about themselves. Poor Walter couldn't hack it. Erika is impious anyway. I cannot believe what Erika did to her poor student. The way in which the opening credits were displayed is creative. Some scenes were rather long, but the music in the background makes for good diversion. \"La Pianiste\" is certainly emotive. My only regret is that I have not read the book before watching the movie.",

The vast numbers of sexually \"complicated\" people exist within our society and their individual tales are rarely discussed in popular culture. Michael Haneke steps foward boldly to correct this problem. Isabelle Huppert's Erika is an exceptionally talented artist and her needs are specific and frightening to those who do not understand the context of her nearly 50 years of life. How can anyone understand anyone sexually? It takes years to understand another individual, and the tragedy of The Piano Teacher is that the character Walter gives up on Erika before development can occur. Frightened people do this in the \"dating\" world everyday. I personally thank Michael Haneke and Elfriede Jelinek for this inspiring story every time I come home from another failed attempt at romance. It keeps me going.",

    "review/text": "Haneke captains another efficacious look into the human psyche with this compelling drama. His vessel of choice this time around is Isabelle Huppert and his voyage takes us far out into unchartered waters where most other captains fear to sail. Haneke leaves port and allows the passengers to gain understanding and appreciation for his vessel. She is small yet highly respected amongst her peers. Despite being built under assumingly harsh conditions her exterior is tough and she is built for the icy waters she frequents. Once our captain has sufficiently displayed the outer of his vessel and gained our respect, he then takes us below deck for a rare exhibit of the ship's viscera. What we see is distressing and unpleasant, however Hanke's ship has sailed and we are now headed for turbulent waters.Huppert gives a brilliant performance as the piano teacher. She beautifully executes both the character's controlled exterior as well as her hauntingly troublesome interior. Haneke's direction is focused and he delivers an unyielding character study that's potent and believable. This voyage is not for the weak of heart. Many will find the subject matter disturbing, and rightfully so, but it would be difficult to deny this masterfully created film the merit it deserves. I almost rated this film five stars instead of four, but I have difficultly giving the highest marks to a film I never plan to see a second time.",

    "review/text": "Nobel or no, it surprised me Jelinek's novel got made into a movie. There is of course a filmable plot to the book, but its blunt narrative is so stylized, almost childish in its urgent impetus, and hounded all throughout with a foreboding sense of reader-voyeurism, that it seemed to me totally unfilmable or at least very difficult to reproduce on film.And then I thought - of course, Haneke. The master of cool intellectual voyeurism, done in a visually often flat but (for the viewer) psychologically harrowing way. Plus, Huppert, the master of sangfroid surrender. It could not be any more perfect. Who else but these two to translate onto film the strange, disinterested yet intense tone of the book?! Yet, curiously, the result is surprisingly a lot less like either Jelinek or Haneke.For one thing, I've never seen his camera as romantic as it is here. It's almost lyric, and although unblinking in its gaze on Erika, it also clearly pities her. It shows her depravity, but it *sees* her as ill. I found myself wondering why Haneke did this. He could not have failed to see the book has far less pity than a slight contempt in its clinical scrutiny. Nor could it quite have been the usual 'movie' reason of having to make its main character sympathetic enough to stay with -- at least not for the director of movies like 'The Seventh Continent.'These aren't complaints. I have no complaints against this movie. But it should be said that even if Haneke isn't interested in a transparent novel-to-film transfer, it's not as obvious in its being a 'Haneke' film (again, not a complaint).Actually, I think the movie is all Huppert's. She's devastating and devastated and completely searing.",

Apologies for being so graphic, but potential viewers should be alerted about what they're getting here. Eventually, the teacher's actions escalate from the inappropriate and mildly criminal activities described to psychotic episodes including the maiming of one of her students.To be fair, the movie is well acted, somewhat interesting, and never becomes boring (the worst sin of a creative work, in my opinion), but in the end the unpleasantness, grossness and endless depressing scenes outweigh the artistic value of the piece, making the film an ordeal to finish. Obviously, other reviewers here on Amazon feel differently, but this is my take. And, if you check out my other reviews, you'll see that I don't need a film to be light and feel-good to enjoy it.There's a twenty-minute interview with actress Isabelle Huppert on the DVD, where she says that the crux of the film is the main character's desire to be loved in an old-fashioned way (\"like something out of a nineteenth century novel\") in a world where men only want to seduce her. \"Really?\" I said to myself, \"but how does that explain her desire to be tied up and beaten, as well as the premeditated criminal maiming of her student?\" I guess I've gotten out of practice with French cinema from the days when I used to enjoy Truffaut films.",

    "review/text": "I entirely agree with the previous reviewers. The actors and actresses are of the best choice. The characters are so well portrayed and the settings are so well depicted. The overall effects are quite convincing. It's defintely shocking and at least commercially this film is a success.The choice of Schubert's music at least serves two points. First, Schubert's music is one of the saddest in the history of music, it's the music of the loniest pilgrim. Second, contrary to Beethoven's music, which is so clear and straight forward, the change of moods in Schubert's music is so sudden and so abundant and that it is often difficult to follow, so are the turns and twists in this story.A general survey of the life of the pianists would making this story more convincing. An American critized Kissin for knowing nothing but playing on the piano from day to night all his life; Glenn gould shut himself up in front of the piano since or before his pre-teens; Allica de Larrocha's mother begged her daughter to &quot;live her life&quot; (Allica's word), instead of sacrifying it to the piano; MargaretArgerich's &quot;fiance&quot; (Margaret's own word) was the piano... The life of a musician destined to become a concert pianist could be very lonely ( and boring )to the point of abnormality unless you really love it, or unless you can balance it with sufficient chamber music or the like. Yet, competition is so keen that 99 concert pianists out of a hundred would advise against a cereer of a concert pianist unless he is exceptionally talented.Obviously the heroine here, despite her sacrifice, didn't make it as a concert pianist. Her mother, so possessive and dominating, openly urged her to earn more money in order to buy a flat. Furthermore, the family has a history of mental problem; and her mother sharing the bed with her even when she was forty something... Needless to say, this case is by no means a norm yet it is not at all unconvincing.What is controversial though is the deliberate distortion of the sound of all music, be it's piano or vocal music, so that there is NO MUSIC LEFT AT ALL. Perhaps this serves the main theme of the story better, delivering a greater impact upon the audience. And yet on the other hand, one also wonders if that is really necessary, whether a mix of bitteress &amp; sweetness would be more impressing.",

Heineke's film, is definitely one of the biggest rises in French film industry. And I agree with the other reviewers, that the film's unknownness is directly related to its unconventional tension, which literally made me scratch my seat in the theater.The film focuses on Isabelle Huppert's sexual and social psychosis, and her isolation from the rest of the society. During the course of the movie, Huppert goes through a couple of sexual explosions, which are not at a pleasing nor satisfying level at all, but rather resulting in discontent and hatred among her and her partner, who is the student she gives piano lessons to. This after-scene suffices for you to feel odd. Her sexual inmaturity, gives rise to her weird behavior during daily life. Her seclusion of her own mother, that precedes her real harrassment of her, is a good example of this idea.This film involves severe tension, sexual and social violence. Beware of this fact before you purchase the film. It's a brilliant film, but for some people. Some may not like the content. Great production by Heineke, great acting by Isabelle Hupport!",

I am not especially fund of dark stories, of sadomasochism. You may want to hold on to something that would make you feel secure and safe while viewing this movie. In a world of dysfunction, the main character, Isabelle Huppert, who plays Erika Kohut is among the top. She is a forty year-old piano professor at the Vienna Conservatory (incidentally she thinks that none of her pupils are good enough). She lives with her mother who worries about her daughter but in actuality is unable to face the fact that her daughter is an adult. Their co-dependency would make you sad. They sleep on the same bed and they even have fistfights! This dysfunctional relationship makes Erika among other things a voyeur. Erika meets a young man, whom she uses to act on her secret desires. He is sympathetically played by Benoit Magimel. Somewhere along the movie you wish she would listen to this man, but this is not a love story although a lot of `I love you' statements are uttered. Even the boyfriend thinks she is sick. It was petrifying to watch a scene where Erika performs an act of self-mutilation. The film never shows the details but the effect is tremendous. This movie drives you on the edge of your seat. It was a relief when it ended, although quite abruptly, so there goes another French movie that will make you think for a long time after the last frame.If you are already a fan of Isabelle Huppert, you will find this extraordinary and remarkable performance indeed worthy of a Best Actress award (2001 Cannes Film Festival). But if you cringe at the thought of a man hitting a woman but would like to get to know Isabelle Huppert, do not make this be your first movie.

    "review/text": "Forget about reading into any meaning that you think this film may offer. The director is known as just a person who likes to mess with your brains. Anyone who has seen his previous works will snap this one up in an instant. Those who enjoy this movie will likely try his other fine beverages for the head.Basically the protagonist, a sexually insane music teacher, is as mad as bag of hammers yet manages to stay somewhat somber in her profession because she fits in with the rest of the snobs, but deep inside she is totally and completely bananas with a surreal sized suppressed sexual appetite to boot. So she walks the music halls with his lemon sucking expression among all the other lemon suckers who are sucking their lemons for very different reasons to hers and for this reason nobody really knows who or what she is like.When a music student falls head over heels in love with her they set out on a voyage of absolute debauchery in every nock and cranny that they can do it in. However his love of her is totally blind to her madness. He perceives her sadomasochism as an extension of her frustration when in fact that it just another major part of her psychosis. As they delve around with each other (sometimes very violently) the viewer begins to understand that this is really just a very sick woman who needs treatment fast and yet the world she works in and her lover can not identify it. In fact many viewers will fail to grasp that the main character is crazy until the very last scene which drives the message home like a knife to the heart.This is great art-house cinema and as an insane movie ranks up there with the best of them. Some of the [] scenes are very close to X-rated material and certainly many viewers will be put off by that and the heavy amounts of violence that are sometimes on display. In short, this is a great movie about insanity, love and professionalism rolled into one. The characters in this movie are unique and the film is certainly deserving of the acclaim it received.Challenging.",

    "review/text": "This movie is unusual from the beginning. I was so transfixed when I first saw it in the theater that I went back three more times. This is unlike you will see from an American studio. The French, it seems, display more bravado when dealing with controversial topics. The story centers around Erika (played magnificently by Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher still being treated like a 12-year-old by her mother(Annie Girardot). Erika seems to derive all of her satisfaction in life by means of a piano. When a younger man shows interest in her, she at first, rebuffs him. You get the impression that Erika has never been involved in a relationship with a man before. The problem is, the man,Walter,(also magnificently played by Benoit Magimel), doesn't know what he's getting himself into. The object of his desire performs masochistic experiments on herself, even to the point of drawing blood. (This scene is omitted in the R Rated version.) After Erika has her student attacked she and Walter proceed to have perhaps, the most unusual sex scene you are ever to see on film. The story unravels with her revelation that she wants him to beat her. The catch, ironically enough,is that she doesn't want to be beaten, she wants to be loved. Everything comes to a head at the when Walter beats and rapes her. The apparent moral of this is: don't say anything you don't absolutely mean. And perhaps, be careful what you wish for. Walter, himself, also says something he ultimately doesn't mean. I found the ending unexpected when I first saw it, and I don't want to give it away. You will have to see it for yourself. Isabelle Huppert's performance in this picture is haunting. You sense her character's cold exterior, while simultaneously, sensing her inner vulnerability. The classical music of Franz Schubert is expertly placed in this movie. And it's effect is obvious when you see it. Both co-stars spent a year perfecting the music. There is nothing false about their performances. There are a number of scenes in this movie that can turn your stomach. If you are looking for lighthearted fare you might want to look elsewhere. But if you are intrigued by something complex and daring, a movie that holds no punches, a movie that will have you talking about it after it is over, or if you appreciate first-rate acting, then I highly recommend this movie. It ranks at the very top of my list of favorites, and has made me into a lifelong devotee of Isabelle Huppert. The DVD includes a 20 minute interview with the star.",

Had I read these reviews, I probably would have not chosen to view this film. However, not knowing what to expect, I found this one very engaging, gripping and more than a bit haunting. Increasingly repulsive, yet fascinating on a number of levels. There is less plot than in the visually-stunning \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" or beautiful muscial \"Sweeney Todd,\" (both highly recommended), but this similarly takes you deeper into the twisted psyche of a monstrous human being -- in this case, a repressed middle-aged, French classical piano teacher. Powerful images stayed with me long after viewing. It's a well-crafted, superbly-acted film on a very difficult, abstract subject. Highly recommended if you like looking into the darker layers of humanity, society and sexuality, without Hollywood's mandatory PC crap or in-your-face politicizing. The French may be pains-in-the butt in terms of international relations, but boy can they paint a twisted celluloid portrait. Excellent, but not a first-date movie!",

    "review/text": "&quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; is the story of Erika Kohut (a once in a lifetime role, perfectly played by French actress, Isabelle Huppert) is a renowned piano professor at the Vienna Conservatory, a top-notch prestigious music school in Vienna.Erika, in her early forties and still painfully single, lives and even sleeps in the same bed with her vicious, overprotective and sadistic controlling mother (played aptly by Annie Girardot, however the part was initially offered to the fabulous Jeanne Moreau).Erika is a complex human being to say the least. Besides the fact that she is playing host to a many colored different lifestyle by acting as the &quot;man of the house&quot;, Erika is utterly and deeply sexually repressed. When things in Erika's tiny, cloistered life get too horribly awful for her own self-expression and outpouring of feelings, she resorts to sexual self-mutilation, voyeurism, porn shops, and her own underworld of unspeakable acts on other human beings besides herself.Then... Erika meets Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), a engineering student-cum-talented pianist who signs on to Erika's &quot;Master Class&quot; that she teaches at conservatory. Walter is struck by the singularly quiet but strong, Erika and he lets his feelings be known. However, Erika &quot;expresses&quot; herself in very &quot;different&quot; ways such as sexual sado-masochism and writes to Walter all the things that she longs for him to &quot;do&quot; to her, all the while, Erika treats Walter like less than a human as she does, most all the people and her own students in her sick, sad and twisted life.The irony of this story is that Erika can only truly express herself and her scant good, beautiful and natural feelings &quot;a priori&quot;- in and through her music, but in really no other way. Her sick and twisted thoughts of man overpowering woman, rape, a sexual relationship with her own mother, self-mutilation, and general sadistic behavior overtake her and in the end... Well, watch and find out for yourself.Really, over and above it all, Erika's jealousy of other human beings who can and DO express their longings, fears, joys, and disappointments get to her in the end. When Erika is finally able to express her feelings and what it is she THINKS that she wants and desires in her sad half-human, base sort of way, she is rejected and thus the end to the tale is quite a sad one...This is probably the most sexually charged movie that I have viewed without any of the cast being the least bit naked. There is no quivering frontal flesh in this fabulous film, only frightful, frigid, fruitless feelings that will cut you to the bone...Careful Viewing Is Required...",

    "review/text": "Well, I finally got the chance to see the movie which won Isabelle Huppert Best Actress at Cannes, the movie which David Lame and his not so merry band of God Botherers tried to stop from being screened in NZ (without them having seen it). Lo, they have turned this movie into a decent sized hit as a result. THE PIANO TEACHER is actually the best SPCS publicized movie I've seen to date. Brilliantly directed by Michael Heneke, who scripted from Elfiede Jelinek's novel.Huppert plays Professor Erika Kohut; a cold, brutal, seemingly prudent piano teacher at a prestious music academy. But behind her icy facade lies an obsession with pornography and sadomasochistic sex. When a gifted young piano student (Benoit Magimel) comes under Erika's tutelage, he doesn't play to her impossibly high standards and as a result bears the brunt of her wrath but he soon finds himself falling in love with the professor who just seems to enjoy playing mind games with him. Though unknown to him Erika is gradually losing control under the influence of her domineering mother.THE PIANO TEACHER is exceptionally well photographed with a complex structure and a brilliant perfomance from Huppert (In fact you easily forget she IS just an actress playing a part).There are some rather grim scenes including plenty of S&M;, a funny drive-in theatre peeing scene and Erika putting broken glass in a girls coat pocket. I'm not sure if this will get a DVD release in NZ, but it deserves to. THE PIANO TEACHER is a masterwork that commands a wide audience, and it was probably only because of its content that it was overlooked by the Academy. One of the best movies I've seen recently.",

(People might also want to compare this film with Roman Polanski's 1960's _Repulsion_, with Catherine Deneuve, which I thought was a much more effective portrait of sexual repression and descent into madness.)My review here pertains to the R-rated VHS version; I have not seen the unrated version, which presumably contains more wretched excesses, like the vaginal mutilation scene, which is missing here.",

However, when a young piano-playing engineer (Benoit Magimel) enters her life with his young mind on his lusty attraction, Erika's life begins to unravel. Trying to maintain control, she continues to seek ways to express her innermost feelings without surrendering to the power of emotion -- having been trapped in an emotionless existence for so long. Eventually, she cracks under the stress of her two worlds colliding, with equal parts psychological danger and the allure of eroticism.Two haunting performances (Huppert and Magimel) make this story as captivating as it is disturbing. In the end, both characters are forever changed, unable to return to the solace of the world they knew before and unwilling to sacrifice their outer shells for inner peace.Not for the squeamish, THE PIANO TEACHER is highly recommended.",

Especially after reading how well it did at Cannes. Roger Ebert even gave it a big ol' bunch of stars.Unfortunately, the only interesting themes (which were hinted at only tangentially) in this movie were said by psychoanalysts 80 years ago and Jean-Paul Sartre 50 years ago. Except the difference was that when those thinkers put their ideas out there, they did so in a compelling way that made sense of our innermost feelings and the world around us. This movie fails miserably in this respect, filling up holes in content with the most over the top violence and sex I've ever seen. I ended up watching the unrated version, which probably made the entire experience significantly worse than it would have otherwise been.Maybe I'm wrong, but I get the feeling that people are rating this movie highly just because of the positive critical reception it got (Cannes, etc.). The emperor's new clothes phenomenon, you know. The acting is good - I can't imagine how challenging it must have been to play these roles. But that's about all I can say for this movie.

The piano playing is really irrelevant to the plot (though of course the movie pretends otherwise). There is a lot of sick violence towards the viewer, in the form of unnecessary and crass depications of supposedly shocking and or titillating sick violence. It's a poorly conceived story bolstered by unconvincing and cheaply theatrical psychology.This is the sort of movie that shows rather than reveals. In one of the most pretentious scenes, the main character assaults her mother, with whom she shares a bed, in an almost sexual way, and this is supposed to symbolize some emotional cataclysm that is otherwise undeveloped in the movie. The central love story is thrown at the viewer, and the sources of the central character's depraved violence against self and others are suggested only in an incoherent way.This movie exemplifies what happens when a weak director tackles a complicated subject. This is not a character study, as some claim, as the main character is nothing more interesting than a fastidious and vicious psychopath. The male lead is a handsome but unexpressive face, who does an alright job of playing an obnoxious violent man hiding beneath a veneer of culture (this role might have had some interest, had it been developed).It's depressing that so many people liked this pathetic movie. `Natural Born Killers' was a better movie.",

    "review/text": "I have never written a review before, but I fear I could be held criminally liable if I did not warn anyone about to waste his money or her time on this movie, just as I would be if I knew that there was a bridge out up ahead and failed to warn oncoming traffic. There are so many things wrong with this movie that it makes one wonder whether or not it was made deliberately to goof on viewers and critics.The plot, if it may be called that, is so creaky that a gallon of Three-in-One couldn't help it. Based on a psychological insight so ham-fisted that even a student in Psyc 101 would giggle, it takes about thirty seconds to determine the basic course of the movie. The main character spends her days brutalizing her students verbally and emotionally while secretly longing--are you ready for the surprise twist--to be physically brutalized in her turn by a lover, within earshot of her harpy of a mother no less. Enter the handsome young man, athlete, engineer, pianist, who is by turns repelled and attracted by the sado-masochistic fantasy, although why is anybody's guess, as one certainly doesn't get much of a clue from his dialogue or his actions. He also utters what has to be one of the funniest lines in the history of cinema during the rape scene, although rape may or may not be the correct word in this context. (And, admittedly, I do not speak French, so had to rely on the subtitles, but I don't think the translators would have gotten that particular line wrong and not any of the others.)There is one group who will, no doubt, enjoy this film, Francophobes. They will find all of their worst stereotypes of and prejudices about the French resoundly re-affirmed: the snobbery, the pretentiousness, the sexual deviance, etc. About the only one missing is that we never see any of the main characters driving a car.Someone, I can't remember who, once reviewed a book by saying that it was a book not to be put down lightly, but to be thrown with great force. I think that aptly sums up this film as well.",

    "review/summary": "a biting sort of austrian humor ...",
    "review/text": "Elfriede Jelinek was occupied e.g. with Condoleezza Rice. The present American Foreign Minister in her Denver-childhood was pushed by her parents exactly the same way into the role of a classical Pianist, as Elfriede Jelinek in Vienna had to experience this sort of oppression at her own body. In her novel \"The Piano Player\" the winner of the Nobel-prize (Literature) brings up for discussion in a satirical, sarcastic, cynical, yes shameless way, which sort of soul-destructive dominance mothers in their four domestic walls can unfold, if they are out-pushed from the public job-career-life (still generally the superiority is the male preference). The mother of Elfiede Jelinek after 1945 led negotiations on reparation payments at Austria with Russia - until male persons (leaving the prisoner-of-war-camps, returned, recovered) pushed away female persons from political functions and other jobs. Jelinek converts those experiences in her novel, filled up with certain autobiographic patterns, and there are parallels to the American Condoleezza Rice (by the way \"Condi\" learned Russian to be able to participate effectively at disarmament negotiations between the USA and the Soviet Union ). A stylish seeker of word-using Elfriede Jelinek chose the form of the ice-cold satire, maybe the best way, to reach the necessary distance against things, which have hurt a person very deeply. Franz Kafka by the way wrote probably less based in depression and despair than acting out of a control room of a tremendously biting Jewish humor: The ability to understand this sort of language-use was lost nearly completely after the extinction of the Jewish culture under the Nazi rule in the German-speaking countries . Jelinek therefore assumes, she is understood really correctly neither by the enthusiastic praising price lenders nor by rageful-hateful raving province journalists. Perhaps by Condoleezza Rice, if she had enough time to analyse such novels - and movie-scripts. Madeleine Albright, the Prague fled Rice- and Colin Powell-predecessor in the minister-office of foreign affairs, she is friendly with Condoleezza Rice; the two women noticed the structural comparability of their trauma: Albright, threatened with death by the Nazis and later on bored by the communists, Rice, colored, threatened by the race hatred in the Ku-klux-klan-environment of the 1960-years in the US Southern States. Elfriede Jelinek felt threatened by her prevail-addicted mother. The education-atmosphere at home had been formed by the typical middle-class-aim, to climb up the social ledder, in order to \"make things better\". Mother Jelinek (and the Rice-parents) focused the education-energy on the only child (a procession not divided, because there are existing no brothers and sisters). Condoleezza Rice became not a pianist (the at-first-wish of her parents and herself) but a Foreign Minister with energy-loaded rage on woman-despising Islamic states, unmarried and equally irreconcilably bitingly as the Austrian writer. Jelinek already for a long time didn't practice on her costly Steinway piano, but she became a language-composing Nobel-prize-winner - vulnerable, fighting against a disputable group of austrian politicians, but retired, fearfully withdrawn living, nevertheless relatively consolidated by a husband and by her special sort of biting humor. Condoleezza Rice, sometimes nicknamed as the US-American \"war princess\" or \"Terminatrix\", maybe the world shoud hope, that a little bit more of austrian humor and ability to see things ironically will find a way into Condi's strategy. Based on such comparisons and knowledge backgrounds about curriculi vitae, opposing the education-atmospheres of these women, you maybe understand the \"Piano Player\" in a more sophisticated way ...",

    "review/text": "This film is simply boring, as are perversions, fixations and all that stuff that in general interests solely psychoanalists,and that just because they get paid to listen to such idiotic craziness. Huppert is OK in this horrid movie, nevertheless I would not save her from the blast. All you will get is annoyed from watching this, it allows no day-after thoughts, it does not linger on within you, as nothing in the movie actually is transcending in any conceivable way.This film is about a pianist who happens to have hell for a home. Continuing the metaphor, the musician's mother is a she-devil kind of thing. To be fair to, well, the devil devil, who's most likely a guy, the pianist's mother is no more than a crippled old lady who has raised her child in an incestuous fashion, thus promoting the multiple sexual nightmarish deeds this woman, as an adult, would engage in. Along with that, the lack of love she &quot;suffers from&quot; proves to be the same rejection and hatred she actually demands in others and, accordingly, delivers to everyone surrounding her.This film is like a classical videoclip. While we enjoy some Schumann tunes we see the piano teacher wrapping herself in acts of extreme cruelty, sex that is far from enjoyable to any average individual, over the edge irrational unbuyable conversation with her mother, the pursual of something more love-like in a younger person (that is, mostly being despised and having a kick out of it). To decidedly ruin the movie is the ending, which stands as one of the worst I have ever undergone.This film has no story line, it does not reach out to the viewer, in it there is no landmark aesthetics of any sort, no revolt against anything, no adherence to anything. It is nonesense poured into allegedly disturbing images, but why would any creator do that? Just for the sake of filming sickening stuff. That is easy to do. Tape a dog dying or a mother crying the loss of her child and you are there. But what for? And, is it cinema?This film is garbage. The main character seeked hatred. Go a step further ahead and hate the whole thing altogether.",

It's true that director Michael Haneke is Austrian, but my guess is the best actors in European cinema today are French. Isabelle Huppert is one of the best and she proves it by portraying the complex role of the piano teacher. Watch her commentary that is included with this film, which is in English. She explains that the theme of the movie is that the piano teacher is afraid of being hurt. She wants love but not seduction and thus wants to control the relationship with her student. I would bet that she speaks good German, but wouldn't you rather hear her speak French?This is my fourth Haneke film: three are in French and one is in German. Regardless of the language, they are all complex, intelligent films. I note some of the comments made by reviewers here: \"twisted cinema\", \"a very unsettling world\", \"provocative perversions\", \"beyond weirdness\", \"holy crap\" and much more. Sure, there is some nudity and unusual sexual behavior here. I would recommend that you not show it to your young children, but let's be adult here.Did anyone notice the beautiful music in this film, most notably Schubert's next to last piano sonata in A major D.959 and Schubert's piano trio in E flat D.929, which is also a recurring theme in Stanley Kubrick's great film Barry Lyndon.",

I still cant tell if she really loved him or not. It seems the only time she feels anything is when shes inflicting pain on herself or pain on others, even the student who loves her.She makes him do certain things and will deny his affections. Then when he does what she supposedly wanted him to do which was disturbing in itself, she is still just sitting there with no emotion at all. This woman was definitely mentally ill and i tried to understand her character but there wasnt really enough information. I dont want to give away the ending but the whole movie is a downer. I didnt understand what happened at the end or what became of her but i have to say this, this is probably the saddest portrayal of anyone ive ever seen on film. I still cant tell what exactly made her that way. Is she a sociopath? Was she abused at some point? Its a slow moving film but effective.",

She lives with her mother (Annie Girardot), a controlling, oppressive woman, and deals with her erotic longings through voyeurism, visits to sex shops and self mutiliation. She still sleeps with her mother. The film largely takes place at the conservatory where she teaches and at the apartment she shares with her mother.Huppert in an excellent on-disc interview says Erika longs to be loved but is frightened of seduction. She treats her students coldly but is drawn to one who is vain and handsome, and played by Benoit Magimel. The rest is the story of her creating and accepting a masochistic relationship with the young man that spirals down into her own psycho-sexual collapse.This movie won't be everyone's choice for an evening with the kids. It's a serious, disturbing film for adults that looks grimly at repressed feelings and emotional self destruction. For the grownups, it might put you off sado-masochism for a few days. It's a first-rate film.Isabelle Huppert is one of my favorite actors. Like Depardieu, she has no apparent screen vanity; she'll do what it takes for the role. She also has the rare ability to express deep, unsettling feelings with an absolute economy of expression. She is incredible in this film.I'm happy to have the disc, but to tell you the truth I'm not sure how many more times I'll watch it.The DVD transfer is excellent, the audio is first rate, and the English subtitles are easy to follow.",

    "review/text": "I happened to watch this film again last night, and I must say that Haneke is a director you have to allow to infiltrate you're way of thinking in order to really understand his work. He has a very distinct viewpoint and is certainly a visionary, and so his films carry with them hidden layers of emotional confliction that I think are pertinent to appreciating them. `La Pianiste' is a dark and disturbing film that could be (wrongfully) disregarded as perverse filth, but there is so much more involved here.Throwing this film to the side due to its graphic nature is denying it the admiration it deserves.The film centers around a middle aged woman named Erika Kohut, a piano teacher who lives at home with her mother and secretly hides her own perverse fantasies; sneaking off to buy smut and witness adult films. Erika is cold and seemingly bitter, a woman who is envious of her young students and strangely dependant on her mother. Her world is turned upside down when she encounters a young man named Walter Klemmer, an arrogant student with talent who cares little for music itself and more for the attention his hands can get him. Erika is repulsed yet fascinated to the point where she dares let him inside her head. Once he has been allowed to see her for who she really is, he challenges her, defying her wishes and showing her that her own desires are not necessarily her own.Michael Haneke is known for his dissection of violence and society. He is constantly tackling that very subject with fresh ideas that capitalize on his gritty sense of realism and sharp eye for detail. Taking the lines one crosses, meshing together the emotions of love and hate, Haneke creates a startling character study that leaves the audience much like Erika, and later Walter...Repulsed yet fascinated.The character of Erika Kohut is a mesmerizing one, because she is so easily condemned for her actions and desires but this is a grave misunderstanding of a woman oppressed by her natural surroundings. She is a woman who has suffered the loss of a father (to insanity) and continually suffers the confinement that comes from paternal control (her mother still treats her as if she were a child). She is lost within her own passions, surrounded by young students who lack the knowledge she has yet she is grossly aware that they will amount to more than she ever will. She is insulted by their mediocre talents. Erika is also alone, lonely within her own view of love. Being controlled and looked down on, she craves someone to dominate her. She puts up the air that she is cruel and controlling and domineering, but she is begging, pleading with the world to knock her down. She has such lack of control within her own life that she needs to control her idea of intimacy. Finding escape in the voyeuristic engagements suited for a prepubescent boy, Erika taints her own understanding of love by feeding herself the filth propagated by the media. She becomes her own worst enemy, and thus falls victim to her own carnal misunderstandings.When Walter gives in and `gives her what she wants', it literally destroys her.The film is, on its own, a masterpiece and a force to be reckoned with, but without the dedicated and fearless performance given by Isabelle Huppert the film would not have had nearly the effect needed to sustain it. When you think of performances that `go there', that really throw caution to the wind and allow themselves to embody a single character, this is one that should instantly come to mind. Huppert does shy away from the character flaws within Kohut. She attacks them head on, unlocking this characters inner most secrets and exposing her full frontal for the world to see. With a performance that includes self mutilation, public urination, proposed incest, total humiliation and twisted perversions of the unmentionable kind, Huppert never flinches in her delivery. What is even better is that she accompanies each scene with the needed emotional connection to make it wholly believable. Watching the coldness melt off her face as she faces rejection from the one she has bared her soul too, it is unbelievably sympathetic. For a woman who has been so rigid and so evil (enough to viciously attack a student) we feel an honest sense of connection to her in that state of turmoil.Huppert is accompanied by some great supporting players, not the least of which is Benoit Magimel, who stuns as her lover Walter. Witnessing his initial admiration for Erika dissipate into a hysterical observation and then completely manic obsession is brutal and nerve-racking. Annie Girardot is wickedly amusing as Erika's mother, a woman who is at the center of her daughters own collapse.In the end, `La Pianiste' is NOT a film for everyone, but it is a film that will provoke you and stir you enough to validate its existence. Michael Haneke is not a shy director, and he does not create fluff films. His films are meant to be analyzed, studied and discussed. If you are looking for a film that will challenge you, then this is a film you should witness.",

Eventually, she cracks under the stress of her two worlds colliding, with equal parts psychological danger and the allure of eroticism.Two haunting performances (Huppert and Magimel) make this story as captivating as it is disturbing.

Rarely do we understand or view the dark side of perfection . . . a calculus that those who are at the top of their game in a given pursuit - are often disturbingly deficient in other facets of their life.Some reviews of The Piano Teacher mysteriously include adjectives of \"gross\", \"despicable\", etc. But they are viewing Piano Teacher through the lenses of a different genre and sanitized perspective. The Piano Teacher is not a family movie. It does not provide us with solace, conflict resolution,or a \"Happy Trails are Here Again\" ending.The Piano Teacher is, however, an amazing exploration of the human psyche, sexual repression, self-worth, and sado-masochsim . . all seething in a professional musical environment where perfection is expected.Very entertaining and thought-provoking .",

    "review/text": "This is a breakthrough movie--but not one that you should undertake watching lightly. The word \"harrowing\" best describes this descent into hell.If you've never been in a battering relationship, you could never understand why someone would stay around and get beaten up day after day, this film will show you. The battering is mutual and invariably followed by bizarre moments of closeness, apology and even tenderness. In emotionally impoverished and dysfunctional families, this is as good as you get, so you go for it.In this sensitive portrayal, the protagonist professor of piano technique, Erika, breaks though her deeply repressed sexuality and attempts to experience love for the first time with one of her students. Attempting to work out her internal conflicts, the love should be expressed alternately in sadism (she's gratuitously mean to all her students) or in masochism (what she demands of her lover is pain and humiliation). Since the object of her desire, Walter, is not only attracive and talented, but also seems to care deeply for her, the agony of this movie is much deeper.As to the film itself, at times it moves slowly. But you need the break to recover from the intensity of the major scenes. The performances of piano and vocal music are paradoxically delightful to hear, and this movie should win an Oscar for \"best sound\" (every creak of a floor board counts).This is a remarkable movie that should be taken seriously and will reward a mature approach.",

    "review/text": "Michael Haneke has adapted Elfriede Jelinek's novel to create this disturbing psychological portrait of piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert). Erika's claustrophobic life is filled with strict teachings and moral hypocrisy. She is a voyeur and masochist beneath her rigid exterior. Her life becomes desperate upon meeting a new student Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel). Their relationship becomes tumultuous when it becomes increasingly clear that she is incapable of nothing like a \"normal\" romance.This tragedy is at many times shocking and is likely to make you squirm in discomfort over the deranged levels of Erika's mentality. While frequently repulsed, I felt an odd sympathy for her at times over the fragility of her being and her difficulty with expressing love. The cinematography of this film is bleak. The atmosphere seems glazed with an impersonality and stark indifference equal to that of Erika's spirit. The air is bizarrely punctuated with the beauty of the many musical recitals throughout the film. Director Haneke has been much criticised for this work (it has been dismissed as pretentious). Though not for the faint of heart or morally concerned, I found it strangely moving and engaging in the way it unsettles.",

    "review/text": "The Piano Teacher is a beautifully acted, wonderfully cinematic, and deeply disturbing masterpiece. It is quite unlike any other motion picture experience I have ever had.Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress and she absolutely shines in her role as a psychotic piano teacher who can't get what she wants, so goes out to ruin the life of others. The movie reveals this slowly and beautifully. I was impressed that there was no attempt at pop psychology or mediocre explanations that you would expect in a Hollywood melodrama with similar subject matter. The film is done in a simple, elegant, and gut-wrentching style, sure to fascinate and disturb, even if the film is hated in the end. Also worth mentioning is that Hubert's troubled but sympathetic character lives with her mother, in what has to be one of the most chilling mother/child relationships since PSYCHO.This is an exceptional film, thought-provoking, powerful, and strangely moving. It is not for those who can't face the dark side of human nature. It's far from being a life affirming &quot;feel good&quot; movie; it's a movie that is difficult to watch and raises plenty of questions. If the difficult subject matter of 'Irreversible' interested you, then this is your kind of movie. I enjoyed it immensely, as uncomfortable as I was watching it, and consider it a worthwhile, rewarding experience.The film has a haunting and disturbing finale, and is not always easy to digest, and therefore, it is not for all tastes. For fans of French or art-house cinema, this is definitely your cup of tea.Note: Stay away from the R-rated version, which goes so far as to blur out the video images in a porn shop.Grade A.",

    "review/text": "This film is so stunning and indescribable! I have never known such joy and excitement watching a new release!Isabelle Huppert is playing one of her best roles here. She is undeniably the best actress in the world.You just need to look at her face in this film to comprehend that. Yes, she never plays the role: she is the character, she lives the character, she feels the character.She is deeply moving in this role. A cold, reserved, distant woman, yet so vulnerable, so tormented!The contrast between her face and her emotions is amazing, fascinating.Loneliness, despair, madness, anger, fear, pain, uncertainty, sadness...Her cruelty and indifference are amazing when she makes her students suffer, and her vulnerability and puerility are even more striking when it's her turn to suffer.The best scene takes place in her bedroom, when she locks herself up with her beloved, handsome student, ignoring her poor mother who is spying outside.She forces him to read a long letter, a letter that she has written and given him earlier, after the piano lesson.The absurd thing is that she insists on hearing the letter read to her, in which she describes what she expects him to do to her, in full details.What a more horrible thing to request from a young man you love!First, he seems embarrassed, surprised, amused. He reads it mockingly as she watches his face inquisitively, intensely, like a child hearing a story for the first time.He cannot believe what he's reading, the innocent young student.No, he refuses to believe her sickening requests. She wants him to humiliate her, to degrade her, to be cruel, to torture, to hurt, strike, rape.He cannot believe it. No, no, his beautiful and respectful teacher would not want such a thing. Besides, he loves her too much to hurt her. He shakes his head, bewildered. To prove that she is not joking, she pulls out her 'torture' tools from under her bed. She shows them to him, proudly and naively, and assures him she is serious.As he reads further, he is shocked, angry, disappointed, disgusted, and walks out of her apartment rapidly.Although there is no violence nor sex in this scene, the impact is heartbreaking, and leaves you breathless.The absurdity, the tension, the intimacy, the gaze, the provocation, allow you to imagine what might happen to her if he obeys her order, something even more frightening, more sadistic, more violent, more erotic, more painful, than the reality itself.It's based on the controversial novel by Elfriede Jelinek, an Austrian writer. The book is even more powerful than the film. If you love the film, you absolutely have to read the book. It's like seeing the film again, and still, the impact is tremendous. There's more in-depth analysis of the characters with a striking style from the author.The philosophical and psychological observations, the wild images are so detailed, so vivid, so absurd, so sarcastic that they make you cry and laugh at the same time.It is a passionate book and a frightening one. All the strongest emotions are in here, with beautiful classical piano for music lovers.Classical music lovers might not agree on the beauty of this book. Classical music is supposed to elevate our mortal souls, isn't it? But here it degrades the musician's soul. How can we tolerate such a thing?Yes, it degrades here, but it's how reality is. Classical music creates the strongest human emotions, and why not torment, suffering, degradation, the passion and pleasure of hurting and being hurt?",

    "review/summary": "Featuring a stunning performance by Isabelle Huppert",
    "review/text": "If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites, then the cinematic portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality. Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself. Her outward expression projects her desire. That is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse.Along comes talented, charming, handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity. He wants to become her student so as to be close to her. She rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent the Vienna conservatory votes him in. He falls in love with her. Again she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer, and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect.The question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control? The sadist or the masochist? Indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist? It is hard to tell. Is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment, or is it the person who is rushing out the door, sated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened.But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. She is a sex extreme freak. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability. Actually that isn't even true. She says she doesn't care what others think. She doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love. Love, she calls it. For her sex and love are one and the same.At one point Walter tells her that love isn't everything. How ironic such a superfluity is to her. How gratuitous the comment.The movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when Walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find Erika within). He also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another. This is particularly important in the scene in which Erika, like a blood-drained corpse caught in stark white and black light, lies under her lover, rigid as stone. Here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery. We don't need to see any more.The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them. I have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul. Like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. What matters to her is the performance and the challenge. No part is too demanding. No character too depraved. It's as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity, and wants us to watch her as she does. She is always fascinating and nearly flawless. She is not merely a leading light of the French cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work.I think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in The Lacemaker (La Dentelli&egrave;re) from 1977 when she was 22 years old. There she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser. Her character was shy about sex and modest--just an ordinary French girl who hoped one day to be a beautician. Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.Huppert is fortunate in being an actress in France where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets. (Hollywood could never make a movie like this.) In the American cinema, only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty. Huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in La C&eacute;r&eacute;monie (1995) in which she plays a vile, spiteful murderess.Do see this for Isabelle Huppert. You won't forget her or the character she brings to life.",

In other words, they explore parts of the human condition that Hollywood wouldn't touch. Huppert brilliantly realizes the portrayal of an emotionally twisted woman: maniacally focused on her art, from a bizarre household she cannot escape, and unable to form loving relationships. SHe is at times sad, cruel, and sexually experimental. However, as a reflection of her loneliness and pain, there is nothing whatsoever titillating about her sexuality.The ride is rough and it isn't for everyone. This is excellent psycho-drama, destined to be a classic that will never achieve a wide audience. Recommended with caution.",

In summary, the piano teacher follows her sexual fantasies down a path that leads to her destruction. It is as others have said a disturbing film, but for me this is not a compliment. There is little in the film worth taking away. The teacher herself is not especially interesting. She is abusive, mean-spirited, aggressive and destructive as a teacher. She maims one of her charges because the young girl dares to smile at the teacher's new sex toy, a young stud who has convinced himself, unconvincingly, that he loves his tyrant teacher. She is not just perverse; she is criminally insane. Her mother, who is every bit as sick and twisted, is a sexual voyeur and tormentor who exploits her daughter's bizarre sexual predilections which include porn shop cruising, drive-in movie peeping, and self-mutilation. Once she gets her hands on her new charge, she presents him in writing with a list of perverse demands. The handsome boy realizes that he is dealing with a sicko and runs for the hills. She stabs herself. I got little out of watching this mess. Who's to know what it all means or what the author intended. I came up with the idea that this \"World\" is meant to be \"Vienna,\" Europe's literal or symbolic music capital, a city of beautiful music and the birthplace of Hitler and the author, even though Paris has been used as the film's setting by the director. These two \"sides\" of Europe seem to coexist, according to the author, but we are given no hint as to what one is meant to do with this knowledge.",

But I'm sorry to have to say that I was very disappointed with this one. \"The Piano Teacher\" revolves around a sexually repressed piano teacher who never smiles, and who is very icy with everyone, including a young man who, for some odd reason, claims to love her. She still lives with her nosy, sometimes intolerable mother in a small apartment, and sometimes you get the impression they hate each other. This woman also likes to go to porn shops to watch porn videos, and she likes to watch young couples getting hot-and-heavy at drive-in movies. A lot of this film's content is racy... Even though some scenes are, well, deserving of being un-rated, they are not done pornographically. After all, this is an artsy French film. It wasn't so much the racy content that bothered me, but more of how it was executed. By the end of the film, I was frustrated. The piano teacher treats this young man horribly, and freaks him out when she gives him a list of violent things she wants him to do to her doing sex. He, of course, isn't amused by this, but I spent the entire film wondering why he even loved her in the first place.I kind of wanted to give this film one star, because I found a lot of it to be very disturbing. However, I can't because the movie is not a bad movie. The acting is superb, and the story, though not my cup of tea, is still a powerful, tragic story of a woman with some real problems. And of course, the music is great. So while it is not for everyone, it is an okay foreign film, so long as you're not looking for a feel-good one.",

The cotidianity establishes in her life an unbearable repetition of a long catalogue of common places. Indeed, the obvious conclusion you perceive after she punishes that promising and talented pupil through the most miserable envy feeling and impotence. In her soul depths she knows her pupil will overpass her in a future not so distant.But suddenly the passion appears and with it the Pandora Box will open with her cumulative sum of expected affection, sexual repressions and the wished love that came behind the masque of the oblivion.She will play hard this role of victim and victimary. In her role of teacher the last profile is well known but she knows the time is brief and somehow as the famous Proust novel she intends to search desperately the missed time.To be honest the camera is not to the same level than the performers. Huppert is overwhelming but the camera eye doesn't maintain the same level of required fierceness and mistakenly you can feel it. If you intend to change visual agression with the deepest insights of that troubled soul avid of love and consideration, we have big problem.Think in Nagisa Oshima with the Empire Senses and you will realize that important device. The way you use your filmic language is even much more important perhaps tahn the same script if you want to accent certain issues to achieve your purpose. Otherwise you will obtain a serious artistic deficit when you analyze the final result.",

    "review/text": "Ok, first, I like foreign movies, and I especially like French foreign films. They just have a different way of doing things, cinematography etc... But this film was really really bad.There really is no character development, you are just to take these vapid characters with extreme problems at face value. The main charcter is a piano teacher with deviant sexual eccentricities, and thats putting it lightly. Follow her through this film while she tries to make everyone and everything that she touches as sad and lonely as she is. She's a mean woman and it's just not entertaining to watch her spy on young lovers at the drive in, and then urinate next to their car while shes in sexual climax, nor is it interesting to watch her sabotage the young career of one of her students by putting crushed glass in her coat pocket. The only up side to this film is the romantic tendencies of her persuer who, for reasons unknown, is attracted to this woman at any cost.She's a nasty woman with serious problems.This film does not resolve a conflict, it abruptly ends.I would not recommend this film to anyone.",

    "review/text": "Hardly. Erika (Isabelle Huppert) is one of the highest regarded and sought after classical piano instructors around. She's held in very high esteem at the conservatory where she teaches. She holds private lessons and does recitals. She's prim, proper and brutally strict with her students. She also cruises porno shops, watches the porn videos (graphically displayed and the only skin in this film) and peeps in lovers' parked cars at the drive-in where she gets so turned on she urinates. She also cuts her vagina with a razor when frustrated. She lives with her aged harridan mother (Annie Girardot) who pushes her daughter to achieve so hard that it results in mama bashing. Then along comes stud-puppy/jock/wanna-be piano whiz Walter (Benoit Magimel) who starts hitting on Erika right and left until she caves in (in a bathroom) and reveals her inability to have normal sex which frustrates the heck out of Walter. But he professes to love her and agrees to whatever she wants. Sort of. She writes a letter telling him what she wants. The utter degradation she desires in that letter made me wonder, dear Lord---how many \"dark sides\" does this woman have? She wants to be tied up, slapped around, beaten, sexually humiliated, gagged---the list goes on and on. Walter is repulsed. No dice, Erika. She follows him and begs for his forgiveness and then promptly throws up when he complies to her demands for impromptu oral sex. He throws her out in disgust. Then he comes begging back in the middle of the night, claiming she's bewitched his brain with her \"sickness\". He locks Mama in the bedroom, brutally beats and kicks Erika and rapes her. He says in effect, \"Isn't this what you wanted?\" What a cad. He even gets away with it. But the ending is what really threw me. I felt like I was the one needing a good slap. The performances in this film are excellent. Especially Huppert. But I can't believe she let the director get away with that ending. It just left me empty and mad that I watched it. The character of Walter is disgusting. Erika is no less pathetic---she's extremely sick and even puts broken glass in a promising but scared student's coat pocket so she'll slice up her hand and can't play. And gets away with it! I don't know who I could recommend this film to. It's played so dreadfully serious---even the scene where Erika tries to have sex with her mother. All I can say is, if you've read what I've written here and you still want to see it, then go for it. But if you're the least bit hesitant, stay away from it. It's that disturbing and unbelievable.",

The students admission of love for his teacher forces her to face up to her repressed sexual urges and fetishes, which, in turn are initially rebuffed as madness .....Although we hope that this young woman would be able to overcome her obsessions there is always a feeling within the viewers mind that this tragedy will not end well.....Definitely for the mature viewers among us ....",

    "review/text": "Superbly acted by Huppert, but couldn't get past the painful granularity of a character that leaves the viewer no choice but to despise her. Her passive-aggressive sadism towards others is born out of the hatred she has for herself. Among the physical abuse she commits against herself in various ways, she also commits the worst kind of betrayal - a teacher who hates her own pupils to the point of committing acts of violence against them - no one is safe around her - she hates all equally. She pours broken glass into a student's coat pocket out of some senseless deranged jealousy, thus completely destroying that student's hope for a career as a pianist. As equally as she doles out the psychological and physical abuse (there is a revolting scene of some sort of bizarre sexual attack she commits against her own mother, whom she sleeps with in the same bed), she also demands to be abused. She asks her student-boyfriend to beat her (and he obliges, seemingly with some regret) but that can't compare with how much she hates herself.Instead of caring about this character, I found myself disgusted by her (mostly because of her own weakness and unwillingness to change). This woman puts on an air of strength, stoicism, and intelligence, but it is really just a cover for her weakness as a person devoid of any conscious. She is too weak to break the sick relationship she has with her dominating mother, so her life is a gradual escalation of a psychosis that she allows to destroy her. She is a dangerous, sociopathic individual with no hope, so the entire film becomes a disturbing examination of that, and doesn't offer anything else.",

I am always up for a challenging film, but there were times during The Piano Teacher where I just wanted to look away. I came close to cutting it off. However, I have set a strict rule for myself, in that the first time I watch a film, I watch it in it's entirety. I finished it, and I am glad that I did. There would have been no point in stopping it prematurely. The performances were excellent all around. Isabelle Huppert is totally and utterly convincing in what had to have been a difficult, exhausting role. Haneke's direction was amazing as well.

    "review/text": "When I first heard about Michael Haneke's \"The Piano Teacher\", about a sexually repressed instructor at the Vienna Conservatory, I thought it was exactly the kind of movie I didn't want to see. In a world awash in pop music, South Park and Britney videos, how could a film about the stultifyingly uptight classical music world have *any* relevance for a post-modern, post-everything film buff (even if he is American?) Didn't Bergman tread this ground 40 years ago? Didn't Bunuel make savage fun of the hypocrisy of bourgeois sexual respectability in \"Belle de Jour\" (1966)? Wasn't Haneke a little behind the times?Walking - or I should say staggering - out of the theater 2.5 hours later, I was humbled by the scope of Haneke's and Huppert's achievement. Rarely have I seen a film both so clear-eyed about sexual psychosis and yet so compassionate as well. Isabelle Huppert, who probably wasn't nominated for an Oscar only because the film can be so off-putting to some, gives what can only be described as an intense performance. Her clenched face and the darting movements of her eyes reveal more about her character - her inner rage, her self-hatred - than most actors can achieve with sheets and sheets of dialouge. That's the essence of the film, everything is very formally *controlled* - so that when violence, self-inflicted or otherwise, breaks out, it is startling because it emerges from such as civilized veneer.If the point of the film were to demonstrate the High Culture spiritually deforms those who engage in it (and I don't think it does), the film would have minimal interest. High culture has been on the defensive so long, it doesn't need to be blamed for driving Isabelle Huppert nuts as well. Rather the film gains its strength from watching a seriously damaged human being - damaged in ways only suggested at - construct a protective cocoon around herself that fails to protect her from troublesome feelings and desires. The film is somewhat similar to Neil Jordan's great film, \"The Butcher Boy\" whose protagonist uses an opposite strategy - relentless good cheer -to mask the absolute misery he's sinking into. In these two films, as well as other recent films like Noe's \"I Stand Alone\", Nyutten's \"L'Humanite\", Haneke's other recent film \"Code: Unknown\" and Tim Roth's \"The War Room\", European filmmakers are portraying contemporary Europe as a society rife with cultural and psychological malaise - along with a great uncertainty as to ability of others to ameliorate the misery that man hands to his fellow man.\"The Piano Teacher\" is important - essential even - not because Isabelle Huppert is asked to do things on camera few major actresses would willingly agree to. The film gets right to the dark heart of our contemporary malaise - our declining faith in the ability of culture - or anything - to ease us out of our despair and mitigate the cruelty we often see around us. The film is extremely distributing, enraging but not empty - it was the most provocative piece of cinema to be release in the US last year.",

    "review/text": "The Piano Teacher shows us a few days in the life of a disturbed woman who is both victim and victimizer. Isabelle Huppert briliantly plays the part of Erika Kohut, a middle-aged piano teacher at a music college in Vienna. Annie Giradot is no less effective as her domineering and watchful mother. The two women abuse one another physically and verbally. This relationship is long standing and comes to a crisis as the film progresses.Erika is unable to break the bonds that attach her to her mother. Instead, like a child who has never grown up, she wants to please her mother, but is driven to act out her own fantasies secretly. Her mother appears to be unaware of the deep seated repression that is consuming her daughter. What she does see is an angry, hateful person who lies to her and deceives her frequently.Erika's sexual frustration takes the form of physical and pschological self-hate. She visits porn shops to degrade herself and she mutilates her body to distract her from the intense psychological pain she suffers constantly.At school her anger takes the form of verbal abuse to her students who are unable to achieve the artistic integrity she demands. What appears to be an inflated sense of her own importance as an artist masks her frustration at being second-rate. She is not good enough to be recognized as an artist in her own right. Her hatred of herself and her inadequacy as an artist prompt her to strike out at students and colleagues alike.Into her seething cauldron of despair comes a young engineering student, Walter Klemmer, wonderfully played by Benoit Maginel, who wants to study Schubert with her. At first she refuses him, but pressure by the school to accept him forces her to work with him. The sexual tension between teacher and pupil is immediately apparent and moves forward to a collision some reviewers have likened to a bad car accident.In the end we see Erika and her student reduced to the lowest common demoninator as human beings. At first Erika is successful at dominating her young student, but the tables are turned as she becomes dependent on him. Both teacher and student are playing a zero sum game to lose. The final climax and its denoument leave Erika a wounded, broken woman.The director, Michael Haneke, elicits finely tuned performances by all the players, particularly Huppert, who is magnificent in the title role. Haneke has made this film for adults only. It is dark and disturbing from beginning to end with moments of pain and violence that are as real as anything one is likely to see on the screen.Huppert as the piano teacher has no redeeming qualities we are able to see in the short space of time covered by the film. Viewers looking for a pleasant and agreeable entertainment are urged to search elsewhere. Haneke shows us a dark side of life and he is unflinching in its portrayal.",

    "review/text": "In French, with English subtitles, this film is a risky psychological drama about a well-respected music professor at a prestigious Vienna music school. She's in her forties, wears no makeup, keeps her hair in a bun and dresses in the plainest of clothes. As a teacher, she is severe and demanding. She and her mother live together and their constant arguments include slaps and tears and reconciliation. Her secret life, however, includes pornography, voyeurism and genital self-mutilation. When an attractive young man starts to pursue her romantically, she shocks him with her perversions. How this all plays out is fascinating and the eventual conclusion is inevitable, but along the way the audience is plunged into this very unsettling world.Isabelle Huppert's performance as the teacher is absolutely magnificent. There are a lot of close-ups of her unsmiling freckled face and dark opaque emotionless eyes. There is a vague reference to her father being in an insane asylum; other than that there is no back-story to help us understand her. Benoit Magimel, cast as her young suitor, has a difficult role as well. During the course of the film, we watch him change before our eyes. All the other characters are also well cast and give outstanding performances.The director, Michael Haneke, kept the tension and erotic undercurrent strong throughout. There is a lot of classical music and scenes of recitals and piano lessons in a very rigid and upscale world. And then there are those scenes targeted to make the audience squirm in their seats. When all the elements are put together, the results are a film that will long haunt my memories.The Piano Teacher is not for everyone. But for those adventurous few who are willing to experience the different and dramatic, don't miss it.",

Isabelle Huppert plays Erika, a brilliant piano professor at a college in Vienna. At work she is respected among her peers and indimidating to her students. At home, she lives with her tyrant mother (Annie Girardot). Erika and her mother have an emotionally abusive co-dependent relationship to the point where they share the same bedroom. Erika's sex life consists of eerie visits to porno shops and sadistic self-mutilation. When one of her students (Benoit Magimel) attempts to seduce her, she agrees but on HER terms.A family film this is not. There are some very disturbing scenes of emotional and physical abuse. But as difficult as the subject matter is, it does help the viewer to understand the psyche of a woman who has been denied happiness all her life. Isabelle Huppert is fantastic in a very difficult role. Her performance of the tortured Erika is the only time, I've seen a character so disturbed and cruel who I found pity in and wanted to see succeed. Forget the Oscar nominations, this is the best female performance of the year! Annie Girardot and Benoit Magimel are wonderful and very convincing in their roles as well. Lastly, the director, Michael Haneke. I've never seen any of his previous work but few directors have the ability to take complete control of my attention and keep it long after their film is over. Haneke is one of the very few who did. \"La Pianiste\" is a masterpiece, I recommend it to anyone who has an appreciation for European cinema.",

    "review/text": "THE PIANO TEACHER goes places most film makers dare not tread - the dark aspects of frustrated sexuality where desire and affection cannot meet. In brief, this is the story of the inner world of an exceptional pianist and piano teacher who lives with her mother in a 'marriage arrangement' that appears to satisfy both with its accompanying fights, jealousies, cheatings, and clingings. This cold pianist (incomparably portrayed by the fine Isabelle Huppert) is absorbed by Schubert and Schumann and shares many of those composers' tendencies towards madness and melancholy. Her private acting out of her sexual life includes forays into pornography video booths, drive-in movies for voyeurism, and other sadomasochistic practices that leave her frustrated in her drive to be humiliated and beaten. Into this sad woman's life enters a sensuously handsome student (again, played with complete credibility and finesse by Benoit Magimel) and much of the film is a hard driving match between lust/desire and need/repulsion, the true approach/avoidance conflict. The pace of the film is so correct for a story about the extended periods of ennui between moments of exhilharation that mirror the life inside a music academy. We are treated to some wonderful Schubert, Schumann, Schonberg, and Bach that serves as the 'dialogue' during extended scenes where the piano teacher listens with her eyes and ears and dsitorted mind, reacting to the music in equal parts with the performing students. Yes, this is a distrubing film, but it is not a grotesque film. Director Michael Haneke manages to place this surreal sexual tragedy for us to understand just how wide the bell curve of human sexuality stretches. An astonishingly fine film - if you are open to explore the dark interstices of the human mind without prejudice. An added feature of an interview on the DVD with Isabelle Huppert about the character she portrays is exceptionally apropos and well filmed.",

    "review/text": "Being a piano teacher myself, I was very curious about this film. I don't teach in a conservatory, but do know that artists at that level can become very eccentric, and when they feel threatened, they can be vicious. Still, this film took that to the extreme and then some. Erika's relationship with her mother didn't make it any easier to achieve mental health, and her sexual fantansies and perversions drove her deeper into the abyss. By all outward appearances, she was a repressed, uptight bully with most of her students who went home to a quiet life with her equally repressed, bullying mother, but she often sneaked out at night to act out her fantasies. It's when an attractive student takes a romantic interest in her that she decides she can use him to act out her ultimate fantasies of being beaten and abused to an extreme. She controls him cruelly until he agrees to follow through. Some of this is hard to watch, but the film is never judemental, and Erika's humanity is always there. As twisted as she has become, she is never a caricature or a two-dimensional character. This is a very dark, very adult tale that left me a little shaken, as I'm sure was intended.",

    "review/text": "First let me put on the record, Isabelle Huppert gives a dynamite performance which is both disturbing, and ultimately very sad .I had first seen her in the movie \"Ma Mare\", which was also great. \"The Piano Teacher\" is a hard film to watch as the subject matter is quite disturbing. It is not the Caf&eacute; Latte S&M; of pretty young twenty-somethings exploring their boundaries here; it delves into the true nature of sexual perversity.Loneliness is a terrible burden to bear and part of the strength of the film is that the director never reduces Huppert to a freak show. Her pain is apparent even though she is at many times a fairly odious (and occasionally downright psychopathic character) Hints of what has led her to this situation are given, the unhealthy co-dependant relationship she has with her mother, the perfectionism and driven nature that pervades her working life, madness in the family. In the end it doesn't really matter how it came about as it is an examination of a person in that state and how they fall apart both emotionally and mentally that is being examined here. There are many scenes which stayed in my mind long after the film ended: 2 particular scenes stood out for me:The scene both embarrassing, horrific and also incredibly sad as the young student reads with disgust a letter Huppert has written to him in front of her detailing her sadomasochistic fantasies that she harbors. We are torn between horrors at the graphic nature of the degradation she fetishists and feel sorry for the horrible and humiliating rejection she receives at the hands of the young student.Also the gut wrenching final scene, the act of self mutilation and look of madness and despair on her face, the director has captured the despair and horror of so much of human existence.An important film to see but don't expect to be uplifted!",

    "review/text": "Like all of Haneke's films, the less you know going in the better, so I'm not going to discuss the plot. You probably already know that it's about a sexually, uh...different...piano teacher portrayed by Isabelle Huppert with astonishing and heart-breaking power, and really, that's all you need at this point. Don't read the plot synopsis above, as it gives away absolutely everything--really, I think Amazon needs to take it down immediately.Although this film might not be for everyone (particularly the squeamish or the faint of heart), it's an astonishingly powerful work of art. A lot of \"art\" movies are boring, perhaps because they are inaccessible; I can't think of anyone who could sit through this one bored. You can think about this movie on the surface or you can keep plumbing its thematic depths, to very worthwhile results. Aside from the obvious themes in the film, such as madness and sexual repression, the break between high art and popular culture, and sexual/romantic politics, I consider this an important feminist and even neomarxist film (insofar as the film is a criticism of capitalist society)--don't believe me? Google Adorno's essay \"The Culture Industry\" and see how closely his ideas are paralleled in the film. But this isn't just me being pretentious, Haneke has Erika drop Adorno's name in casual conversation in the second scene of the film; and of course, Elfriede Jelinek, Noble Prize in Literature winner in 2004 (a scandalous win that shook up the stuffy old academy) is a feminist writer, so we know to look for these themes. Other themes include: voyeurism (especially yours, the viewer...Haneke is definitely trying to punish you for your prurient search for titillation disguised as high art--we're all guilty of it!), parent-child relationships and stage parents, and on an intriguing level, the nature of love, and how it's perverted by capitalist society.Sound like too much for one film? It's not! This one will profoundly shock you, leave you thinking about it for days. I've been thinking about it for months now, and only slowly did many of the ideas in the film become clear.That's the great thing about Haneke; he can weave a lot of different concepts into a film which still works as a film--I can't say you'll have fun, but you will definitely NOT be bored.",

    "review/text": "After I saw \"La Pianiste\" several years ago, I said to myself that I would never see it again, so powerful and disturbing it was. Time went on but I could not get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut out of my mind. The story of a respected Piano teacher in Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing. I read the book \"The Piano Teacher\" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel Prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it I saw the film again. Second time, all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as \"Le Pianiste\". Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schubert's Piano music, \"soaked in the morbid humanity\", is another bright star of the movie.I only have one problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes to Erika's character comparing to the novel. In the book, the furthest she went to reveal herself to Walter, the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book would never chase Walter to throw herself to him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to act, she was not a chaser - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course, Huppert was heartbreaking) but it took the mystery that surrounded her - Jelinek did not write that scene, it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film.4.5/5 or 9/10",

Huppert is excellent as a middle class piano teacher who on the outside is a rigid woman in control of her life as much as she is in control of her students, she demands perfection and accepts no excuses. In her private life however, she is torn apart by contradictions. Hupperts commentary in additional material sums it up perfectly, she is almost like a child. Smothered by a mother who controls every aspect of her private life she resorts to what many would consider a 'perverse' private life.She becomes the unwilling victim of the attractions of one of her students, a young man who has it all, well off family, friends and the social standing that means what he wants, he gets. After a long pursuit Hppert finally gives in only to discover that by opening up to this young man she may lose more than she ever imagined.This is a film that does at time demand your attention as does last over 2 hours but sit through it, you will be rewarded by the end.",

I won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is one new area I want to touch on...**SPOILERS**Why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's pocket? Most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatifactory performance. I must disagree. Watch the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage. The student is quite an expressive girl (crying &amp; vocalizing her fears)- just the opposite of Huppert's character.There is a scene later in the film, after the girl is injured, when Huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. The mother, visibly upset, states &quot;We gave up everything so she could study piano&quot; and Huppert immediately snaps &quot;You mean SHE gave up everything, don't you.&quot;So it was my thought that Huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny. She didn't want the girl to end up like HER, repressed &amp; hardened, condemned to a life of recitals...gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection.For me, that realization made all the difference in what I experienced through this film.

But I found none of its explicitness gratuitous in the least. I thought it was a very honest portrait of the pain and anger of an individual. I wouldn't really say it was about sadomasochism, because I think it's much deeper than that. It's exposing, in a painfully raw way, the torment of a particular person. I imagine this film will resound with two kinds of people - cinephiles focused on the artistry of the film and those who identify, on a personal level, with pain. For those, Isabelle Huppert expresses more truth in the movement of an eyebrow than in just about anything else I've seen. If you know what you're getting into, &quot;The Piano Teacher&quot; can be an amazing experience.",

    "review/summary": "the exalted plane of art and the sad refrain of one life",
    "review/text": "Isabelle Huppert is in one great movie after another. A couple of years ago she played the mysterious and apparently selfless wife of a famus composer in Claude Chabrol's Merci Pour Le Chocolat. This time she plays a piano teacher in yet another role filled with subtlety and mystery. The role is in many ways reminiscent of the earlier one as Huppert reveals clues to her characters troubled psyche with odd and disturbing actions which offer a sharp contrast to her calm and collected exterior. She does much of her acting with the same expression which makes her one of the most interesting performers to watch for what she conceals with each performance is what fascinates and keeps us attentive. The performance Huppert gives as the piano teacher is a disturbing one for beneath her reserved exterior and her very high reputation seethe the passions of an unhappy woman. Whether her mother has caused her daughter to grow into the person she has become or not is perhaps a matter for debate. It appears the mother is over protective but then as the story progresses one sees the mother has good reason to be over protective. Huppert's piano teacher loves her mother it seems but also wants to torture her mother. For her students the piano teacher wastes no time with feelings it seems but again the performance is subtle and layered and offers clues that perhaps she does care for them in her way. It is possible to interpret some of her actions in more than one way. Ultimately we find it is only she herself she wants to humiliate/torture as we see her act out in various circumstances-- most notably in her actions toward a young student who has an infatuation with her-- her own self-degradation. Frame to frame the story is exquisitely shot and told. The music is used to incredible effect. In one particularly fabulous scene the director allows the high plane of music of a previous scene to follow Huppert into the next scene where she enters another plane,one that is not high.",

    "review/text": "Many of the reviews have provided very good plot summaries, descriptions of major scenes, etc., but none have really given a good description of how this film makes you, as the viewer, feel. This is a pity, because here we have a powerful film that leaves you unsettled and puzzled. The main characters are far enough askew that you cannot identify with them, but real enough that you empathize. Moreover, while it is easy to say that the sado-masochistic themes are what makes this film troubling, there are really many layers where we are stymied in our hope for resolution and explanation.Clues are strewn throughout the story, bits of history that we latch on to in our quest to understand why this piano teacher is so cruel, why she withstands the abuses of her mother, why she mutilates herself. The easy answers are unsatisfactory. She abuses her mother as much as she is abused. Her father went crazy, but was there something unspeakable in his past? She is a perfectionist, but seems jealous of others. Inevitably we attempt to use these clues to \"solve\" the puzzle, but our piano teacher always seems one step ahead in eluding us. Further, this leave-a-clue/elude-resolution pattern continues through the final scene of the film, thus we cannot attempt to understand or explain it until after we have seen it in its entirety. Watch this film with someone and you will spend hours discussing it in an attempt to understand it. Usually, when my wife and I watch a film, we discuss how it fits in with other films, its potential importance and influence(s). With this film our discussion never made it outside the film - we were trying to understand the characters.This film changes the way you look at other people. When we are introduced to the main characters,Erika Kohut and her student Walter Klemmer, we see characteristics that remind of of others we know. Yet as we learn more about them, we are disturbed. We don't like what we find when we cross from the public to the personal - and by extension we begin to wonder about those around us, even how we appear to others. That we never resolve the characters, that we never figure out how to categorize and place them, exacerbates this disruption of our view of humanity. The real and the surreal are so tightly woven in the characters that we lose confidence in our ability to discern. We become a bit like Walter Klemmer who is clearly flailing in his attempt to regroup after his teacher reveals a bit of her \"real\" self.While the film is disturbing, the shock comes from the characters, particularly Erika. Her actions defy our sensibility, and while there are serious sexual overtones - if not plain sexual actions - in the film, everything is so much imbued with a sense of pain and emotional sickness that we are shocked rather than titillated. Visually the film is beautiful, if a bit dark. Sense of space, mood, and feeling change with ease. This is a film that looks natural, rich, and vibrant. The disjuncture between the public scenes and the private interior of the characters (again, primarily Erika, though Walter throws us a few curves) is part of what makes this film work so well.Again, I highly recommend this film, but with the stipulation that it is not for the weak of heart.",

It seems that if something absolutely repulsive is created in an artistic way people are eager to praise it or risk being labeled anti-intellectual. I saw the rated R version and had to turn away and even fast forward the scene involving the violent confrontation. Anyone who can view what looks like rape to me and call out \"brilliant!\" or \"artistic masterpiece!\" is too twisted for my taste. This is not a film for a seeker of beauty or anyone with a sensitive heart. Even if you love drama and tragedy, as I do, this work is in a category all its own.

She was unused to men's bodies inexperienced and to be honest it takes practise to swallow an oyster on yer back when even trying to swallow a sip of water on your back would make anyone gag! ! All through the film I never lost empathy with her although tempting to ridiculeUp until he recognises what all the ice thrown on him really signified her suppression and perversion were carefully contained and the terror of opening up such a Pandora's box to her and their eyes was understandably something she fought tooth and nail to have control over. There is always something ingenuous about Walter because he is just too young and virile and compassionate to be complicated by the mess inside her head. If such a thing is possible in real life his direct approach helps her to finally mirror that which is dis-associated in her as sick and mad. He sadistically rejects her after her masochistic letter. Well fair enough because when she begs the error of her ways he does forgive and accept.But then throwing up an oyster is just BAD TIMING in terms of trying to come across as apologetic. That is the comedy before the film takes a dark turn when Walter returns and insanely beats and rapes her. At the concert there is a niave spring in his step as though partially delivering on the request in her letter will hopefully create another rebound from her in terms of coming to her senses again. But of course she already had. The knife meant to atone for the damage he inflicted she turns on herself in disgust but much more so-in self disgust.The film transitions from the world of polished classical recital to tragic opera and underlines the warning that men should never physically harm women because they don't know their own strength. Although the true villain of course is the mother ( and unbalanced father) in untold insidious psychological ways. This is a disturbing film. So was i'Funny Games'",

    "review/text": "I entirely agree with the previous reviewers. The actors and actresses are of the best choice. The characters are so well portrayed and the settings are so well depicted. The overall effects are quite convincing. It's defintely shocking and at least commercially this film is a success.The choice of Schubert's music at least serves two points. First, Schubert's music is one of the saddest in the history of music, it's the music of the loniest pilgrim. Second, contrary to Beethoven's music, which is so clear and straight forward, the changes of moods in Schubert's music are so sudden and so abundant and that it is often difficult to follow, and so are the turns and twists in this story.A general survey of the life of the pianists would making this story more convincing. An American critized Kissin for knowing nothing but playing on the piano from day to night all his life; Glenn Gould shut himself up in front of the piano since and before his pre-teens; Allica de Larrocha's mother begged her daughter to \"live her life\" (Allica's word), instead of sacrifying it to the piano; MargaretvArgerich's \"fiance\" (Margaret's own word) was the piano. The life of a musician destined to become a concert pianist could be very lonely ( and boring )to the point of abnormality unless you really enjoy it, or unless you can balance it with sufficient chamber music or the like. Yet, competition is so keen that 99 concert pianists out of a hundred would advise against a cereer of a concert pianist unless one is exceptionally talented.Obviously the heroine here as \"a piano teacher\", despite her sacrifice, didn't quite make it as a concert pianist. Her mother, so possessive and dominating, furiously urged her to earn more money to buy a flat etc. Furthermore, the family has a history of mental problem; and her mother sharing the bed with her even when she was forty something. Needless to say, this case is by no means a norm yet it is not at all unconvincing. And having been to the concert hall where this film was shot, it appears to me strikingly sad and true.What is controversial though is the deliberate distortion of the sound of all music, be it's piano or vocal music, so that there is NO MUSIC LEFT AT ALL, ONLY NOISES. Perhaps this serves the main theme of the story better, delivering a greater impact upon the audience. And yet on the other hand, one also wonders if that is really necessary, whether a mix of bitteress & sweetness would be more impressing.",

The one thing I have trouble understanding is the true reason of why the piano teacher (Isabelle Huppert) is the way she is. You can say out of nowhere, oh she was molested or raped when she was young or something but the movie never ever shows any flashbacks or reveal any true thoughts or opinions of her nature from her own point of view. The good job done by this movie is making the viewer a 'voyeur' into this woman's situation as she struggles with a man and her own mother. Another good reason why I liked the film is because of the ending. I just remember feeling so cold and depressed from the ending becuase it was something that I did not expect to happen at all. Personally this movie gave me a jilt and if your into ever watching foreign films than I recommend The Piano Teacher.",

    "review/summary": "Lust in the Lavatory",
    "review/text": "Shortly before seeing this film, I watched a DVD of Bertolucci's \" The Dreamers\", both for the first time. It was informative to compare the two products of film-makers who are regarded as serious practitioners of the Art, and whose work often incorporates explicitly sexual material that risks demeaning their serious intent and exposes them to the charge of gratuitous audience titillation. In the case of Bertolucci's movie, the sex was graphic and not in the best of taste, but one could argue that it had a place in the lives of its young protagonists who were representative of much of their generation: narcissistically focused upon their own self-gratification and freedom of expression at a time when freedom of expression as a whole was under restraint by the State. Not until their indulgence brought their cocooned existence crashing down did they see fit to join those at the barricades fighting for universal freedom.With \"The Piano Teacher\", it is an altogether different matter. We are exposed to two hours of sordid behaviour, self-destructive as well as destructive of others, by a totally deranged individual (Erika) with no redeeming feature beyond a certain musical talent, and no causal factor other than a domineering mother and a father who is mentioned only briefly, but who apparently went mad and killed himself. Even if we accept these as partially exonerating, it still leaves the whole experience as no more than a case-history of lunacy with no universal relevance and no political, moral, religious, ethical or philosophical purpose. The interview with Isabelle Huppert, who plays Erika, included with this DVD reveals the lack of anything meaningful that all concerned in its production have to communicate to its audience. She describes the objective of the director and the motivation of the central character that she plays as an attempt to explore the search for \" true love without the taint of seduction\". What garbage! On this premise, genital mutilation, maternal incest, fornication on the floor of a public toilet, and submission to requested flagellation and physical brutality, all become justified as acts of \"true love\". It is clear that Huppert has no valid idea of why she is doing the awful things she is required by the director to perform; viewed in this light, her much-lauded performance becomes no more than a meaningless charadeinvolving a limited repertoire of scowling gestures and hysterical outbreaksthat soon become boring and irritating to watch.It does not help that the other characters are equally unattractive, at least in their behaviour. As the object of Erika's perversions, Benoit Magimel initially presents as a sensitive and charismatic young man, but his descent into frenetic violence instead of simply walking away from an impossibly unsavoury relationship ruptures that bond of empathy with the viewer. The technical skills of Michael Haneke are evident in the composition of many of the frames and sequences that give this film an artistic texture, coupled with the gorgeous music of Schubert, Bach and others that introduce brief interludes of sanitizing poetry. His serious talent, demonstrated in \"Cache\" and \"The White Ribbon\" persuaded me to discount the 16 1-star reviewers and heed the recommendations of the 54 who awarded the movie 5 stars, especially as many of the latter came from intelligent and critically eloquent film buffs. I was fully conditioned by his above-mentioned movies to become immersed in the lives of thoroughly unlikeable individuals, since these seem to represent the only segment of humanity in which he is interested. I expected the compensation of a challenging and thought-provoking experience in return. All I got was senseless depravity without meaning or justification.",

But I didn't know that my pity would turn into disdain and utter contempt for the demon inside her.This movie takes female sexual frustration to an extreme, and shows just how painful and cruel it can be. It depicts the moral degeneration of a middle aged woman who never achieved personal or professional gratification despite her immense potential as a pianist. She has turned her art into a weapon of remorse and sadistic cruelty. This is a very adult movie, which I didn't enjoy, yet I found compulsively watchable. Huppert makes all female villains in all of the movies put together look like vestal virgins. This is the type of movie that plays with the viewer's mind to the point where one feels the need to take a shower after watching it.Huppert plays the-piano-teacher-from-the-bottomless-pit to near greatness.

Roz's theatrical tendencies toward roles (i.e. Auntie Mame, etc.) was annoying but reached great heights during a Sake binge. Eddie, the houseboy, was amusing in his Sumo wrestling adulation and western music and irritating habits. I found the surprise visit to Mr. Asano's home very educational in terms of how to adapt to this ancient culture. Also, a nod for certain religious aspects and rituals for the Jewish faith were intesting. Mr. Black's overacting following the foiled negotiations (doulbe gins, smoking incessantly, fearful anger, and pacing, etc.) were too far from his completely humble demure persona. I relished the taking back the respect from the youngins philosophy and found this the greatest treasure in the movie. Very complex storylines and surprise twists that made for compelling viewing.

I knew if I woke them, I'd be in big trouble. So eventually, I got too nervous to enjoy the movie, and went to bed. But, I never forgot the movie, and always wanted to see the end.Then one day recently, I suddenly thought about it, and realized I could probably buy it online. I couldn't remember the name of the movie offhand, but I did a search on Alec Guiness, and recognized the title when I saw it.So, I finally got to see the end. I won't tell you the end, but I will say it was worth the wait. This is a sentimental movie, true, but it also has a number of ideas that work through it. (You remember ideas...) One of the themes, stated in other reviews, has to do with racism. Then there is main theme that, if you are right, and the rest of the world is wrong, then you form a majority of one. Great idea! And there's the idea that mature people should be respected because they have more experience in human relations than young people.Funny thing is, my mother watched it with me, and loved it even more than I did. It was fun to watch it together as two adults, after my past history with the movie.Okay, accepting Alec Guiness as a Japanese gentleman is a bit of a strech.

A Majority of One was so heart warming and reminiscent of the great movies of old that left you wanting more. After viewing the movie I immediately started searching for the movie online to purchase because I wanted my family and friends to see such a wonderful movie. To my dissatifaction Movies Unlimited did not have this movie. I have searched monthly hoping that TCM would show it again and to the present day, it has not been shown again. Only today did I order a used copy from Amazon. If you love an old fashioned love story between two unlikely characters in a far away land with great obstacles to overcome, you will love this movie. It transported me to a time when I was a child dreaming that I would find someone to love me and express it like Mr. Asano did in the movie. This is a feel good movie and will be a pleasure for the hopelessly romantics at heart.",

    "review/text": "In 1961 Leonard Spigelgass adapted his Broadway play for the Warner Bros. film starring Rosalind Russell and Alec Guinness and directed by Mervyn LeRoy.This popular Broadway play weaves both comedic and dramatic elements to question whether individuals can overcome the mutual suspenses and prejudices that war wounds have left upon their souls.My husband and I watched this movie last night on TCM. We both thoroughly enjoyed it. An unusual story line. Alec Guinness and Rosalind Russell were old pros. They played it so well. It was enjoyable and funny watching their relationship slowly develop in spite of the odds. There were a couple of surprises especially at the end. I was taken off guard. (No spoilers here.) It was a real delight to watch on a Saturday night. Just one criticism: the Asian appearance of Alec Guinness' eyes was poorly done and I found it somewhat distracting. They simply didn't look normal. Rosalind Russell won her fourth Golden Globe for Best Actress for this performance. Alec Guinness worked hard to play a Japanese man, spending time studying Japanese culture. He seemed totally at ease playing the part.Madlyn Rhue was one of my favourite actresses from the 50's-1984. It was nice to see her again. She died in 2003 from MS complications.Awards and nominationsAcademy Award for Best Color Cinematography (Harry Stradling Sr., nominee)Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures (Mervyn LeRoy, nominee)Golden Globe Award for Best Film Promoting International Understanding (winner)Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy (winner)Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actress - Musical/Comedy (Rosalind Russell, winner)Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Comedy (Leonard Spigelgass, nominee)(Ref: Wikipedia.com)FYI:It has been produced on a DVD from the manufacturer.

    "review/text": "I was watching the bizarre makeup jobs in the current Cloud Atlas, in the segment set in Korea, and Hugo Weaving and Jim Sturgess are made up in what amounts to \"yellowface\" when suddenly I remembered watching A Majority of One long ago and thinking, why on earth did they put Alec Guinness in the part of the Japanese millionaire? Back then, the answer was that people thought Alec Guinness was such a great actor he could play anything! Even 20 years later, Guinness was being cast as a native of India in David Lean's film of Passage to India, and it didn't really work there for him. Maybe times had changed, but even in the 60s there must have been an eyebrow or two raised up seeing Guinness acting like Peter Lorre with gray stripes painted under his eyes, and looking down at the floor instead of looking at Rosalind Russell's face.Basically the acting is so stylized that many will not buy it, but after awhile, I just let the pleasures of the story sink in and before I knew it, my liberal tear glands had been stimulated and I was all abawl and nosedeep in Kleenexes. Watching this movie must have made Rodgers and Hammerstein wonder why they had even bothered with the sturm und drang of South Pacific, because here was South Pacific, except perfected. They must have felt like two John the Baptists preaching the coming glory of A Majority of One. In fact it's not surprising that Hammerstein died not too long after the release of the Majority of One movie--his work on earth complete. Maybe South Pacific does better in the scenery department, though those tragic red and yellow and blue filters are still recalled with horror by every musical fan. But at least the actors seemed like they were outside, somewhere, in South Pacific. I daresay that stage sets were used both for Brooklyn, Pan An cabin interiors, and all of Japan--which amounts to two plain looking streets and as dockside steamer lounge. The rest of the budget for the movie must have been spent in hiring box office titans Russell and Guinness. I'd like to say a few words concerning the performances of Madlyn Rhue and Ray Danton as Russell's daughter and son-in-law. They are wonderfully Mad Men in their ways of dressing, speaking, and sexing it up. Danton is particular swaggers through his ambassadorial role as though he thinks he';s playing the lead in a biopic about Hugh Hefner. The young actor who plays Eddie, the vicious Japanese houseboy, is worthy of a Quentin Tarantino cameo himself. He is extraordinary in his part, a shot of sheer adrenaline in a very dainty and refined picture.As many have noted, Rosalind Russell is supposed to play a Jewish widow in this movie, and she is famous for trying to relate Jewish holidays and customs to Japanese ones, as though to underline the point that it's a small world after all. I have no idea of how to say You're welcome in Japanese, but I expect that if ever put to the test, I would say, Don't Touch My Mustache, since Russell advises her charges to do just that, not once, but three times in the picture. If you liked Hiroshima Mon Amour, A Majority of One might upset you with its somewhat casual attitude towards the markets opened up by the atom bomb, but there you go, you can't please everyone. After awhile you do notice how the movie is one big commercial for capitalism, the trade conference stuff is so boring until you realize that the whole point is that America and Japan can get along because both countries have an appreciation for getting wealthy. Would Guinness have gotten to first base with Russell had he not been a plutocrat? Hard to say.",

    "review/text": "Let me tell you what you get when you buy this movie: We start with a mental patient escaping from a hospital. This takes about 1 minute, as the nurse walks into his room, the lights are out, and someone grabs her. Okay, then we get the longest thrash metal song ever recorded. A really generic thrash metal song. While this thing plays and plays and plays, we watch feet walking down the street. For about two minutes. Then we watch an elevator door open and close while the opening credits are displayed. This takes probably 8 - 10 minutes. Then we're lucky enough to watch the camera go around in a circle over a bunch of garbage laying on a floor. And the thrash metal song still plays! Congratulations movie makers, this marks the first time I've hit the fast forward button withing the first two minutes of a movie.Then we meet our characters. The guys are basically dirtbags, and so are the girls. A couple of the girls are quite well endowed, which is about the only good thing in this whole movie. Even though they all look to be in their mid-late twenties, we're apparently supposed to believe that they're too young to buy alcohol, so we waste some time as they discuss how they're going to get alcohol and then we waste some more time actually watching one guy standing outside a liquor store trying to talk somebody into buying beer for them.Anyhow...they eventually arrive at this building where they're going to do some partying. It's under renovation, so nobody lives there. Oh, except for the slasher. The \"kids\" go up to the roof and we get another thrash metal video. At least the photography is nice this time, the cameraman zooms in on the girls' chests quite a bit. Then we waste some more time as they play with a Ouija board (one girls spends a while talking about how dangerous it is), and it spells out \"death\". Oh yeah, now we're terrified. A couple wander off for a makeout session, and the slasher kills them in a pretty routine manner. I have to say, there is a fair bit of scary atmosphere when they're wandering around inside the dark building. Unfortunately, it's too little and way too late to help this movie much.Another couple wanders off and gets killed in another pretty boring scene, then the others meet a crazy lady who explains the killer's motives to them. This scene is pretty laughable actually. They're running for their lives but stop to chat with a crazy lady, lol. The showdown between the killer and the last survivor is pretty good actually, I'll give them credit for that. Okay, now the movie's pretty much over, but we get another music video, a completely pointless surprise, and then ten solid minutes of closing credits. Whew, I think we can almost call this a movie now!Overall, crummy characters, so much padding it'll have you fast forwarding within five minutes of putting in the DVD, no plot whatsoever - even for a slasher - and a small amount of good atmosphere. A small amount of T&A;, and some boring deaths. It's not the worst thing I've seen lately, but it's in the ballpark.",

Was it necessary ? Hell yeah it was !! It was because the world always need another SLASHER flick if you ask me. That one is about a bunch of (very) horny teens having an orgy in a abandonned buiding. All they want is to get stoned, get high and have sex. All we want is to see them die ( it's not that there is something wrong with them though... ). Fortunately for us, a big ape-like machete killer fresh out the looney bin has found shelter in the same very building. So you know, some people are being dismembered, strangled, impaled while making love... the usual lovely stuff we've come to expect and enjoy.CORBIN TIMBROOK got major skills, his movies always look more expensive than they are. It's especially obvious with this one being a STERLING production. When it comes to production values everything is pretty much on point.Most of the actors are good, the editing is involving and the cinematography is allright even though they could have used more lights ( it's a bit too dark at times ). Now the GORE... don't expect much it ( in other words this is not VIOLENT SH.. man ) but enough for you not to feel cheated.The bottom line is : if you wanna see some machete slashing into some sexy bimbo's skull and some nudity, GORYSSIMO advice you not to go further and to enter the TOWER OF BLOOD.",

This would have subbed for the lack of story. Instead we got yet another masked killer, with a bid knife killing a group of horny teens, who should have been at home, but instad chose to spend the night in an abandoned building.

Knut Skram, though relatively unknown, gives a great performance as Figaro- his, &quot;Se vuol ballare&quot; is now tied with Samuel Ramey's as my favorite version of this song. Ileana Cotrubas makes a funny, playful Susanna, if a bit overshadowed by Dame Kiri. Benjamin Luxon makes an ideal Count, with a fabulous Act 3 aria, &quot;Vedro mentr'io sospiro.&quot; The smaller parts are all quite good, especially Marius Rintzler as Bartolo- he made me laugh a million times, especially in the Act 3 Sextet. Though Sir John Pritchard may not have as tight a grip on this score as, oh, Bernard Haitink or Sir Georg Solti, but he keeps the orchestra under control well, and the sets are authentic and impressive. Here's what to look forward to in this video: A fabulous &quot;Voi che sapete,&quot; a beautiful &quot;Dove sono,&quot; a few great costumes- Cherubino, the Count, an incredible Act II and Act IV finale, In all, a great video, I really suggest it.",

    "review/text": "I wish Amazon would let customers use 1/2 star ratings cos this is actually a 4 /12 out of 5; Just short of a brilliant masterpiece in mid-80's four to ten minute attention spans, with a fake band aping Menudo and playing a song that makes Rick Springfield sound sophisticated.I first watched this on a drunken movie night binge and we were so impressed we played it twice: Half of which was due to being able to make zero sense of what was going on. Under initial scruitiny, the film appeared to be three features that had been edited down to become \"chapters\" in an athology piece, and ten minutes or so of research proved that to be true: NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR is actually three features from director John Carr, two of which were miserable bombs and one of which was apparently never finished, that the producer[s] then cut down to the barest minimum of footage deemed necessary to make them into the anthology chapters.The most popular & memorable of the three is actually the unfinished SCREAM YOUR HEAD OFF with the great John Phillip Law in what would have been another one of those sad exploitation & horror films he was reduced to appearing in just to keep up on the alimony payments in the late 70s/early 80s. Because the film was never finished & trimmed down to about 27 minutes or so of footage, what we are left with is a dizzying tale about an insane asylum that is a front for a body parts harvesting organization, with Law being their latest recruit to be hypnotized, go out into the world & drug people [usually attractive B movie would have been starlets], bring them back to the asylum and turn them over to Richard Moll [billed as Charles Moll] who straps them down to gurneys, strips them nude, molests/assaults them, and then uses a hacksaw & other implements to carve off the marketable portions. Along the way we get a sexy head nurse Ratchet from hell, a lobotomized asylum director, John Phillip Law singing a church hymn, and what would have been the finest American made Mad Asylum thriller since DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT, which this movie is very reminiscent of. Gory, filled with exploitative nudity and utterly incomprehensible, this is my favorite of the bunch as well & the lost footage should be resurrected for a reconstruction -- It'd be an instant classic.Part two is actually all that is left of what was known as DEATH WISH CLUB, a straight to video bomb that actually is very reminiscent of Jess Franco's exploitation/murder mystery hybrids & shares their air of tacky immediacy. A not so young couple run afoul of a pornographer who enrolls them in a suicide thrill club, with results that are utterly hilarious and, again, edited down to the point where the film has no continuity on it's own and had to have a voiceover narration explain the events which unfold. They are not bothering mentioning, but the claymation killer bug is, a device that Carr apparently became enamored enough with to invest a serious amount of screen time to it in the next chapter;CATACLYSM. This was another home video only bomb that actually did find a release & is the least comprehensible of the three: What starts out as a sort of (...) Atrocicties From The Past bit turns into a confrontation against the Antichrist that allows for Carr to do a series of claymation sequences involving a giant Golem like creature run amok, as well as the anthology's most extensive use of his trademark horror gimmick: Having a victim electrocuted so that their head begins to shake back & forth like one of those mechanical paint shakers, while the flesh sizzles & smokes & melts off the skull [when allowed to run it's course]. While this may sound \"gross\" it looks about as realistic as his claymation Golem, and makes for laugh out loud moments that lovers of trash horror will go bonkers for.Linking these three segments are a series of discussions between God and Satan [both played by Cameron Mitchell, who also plays the detective in the CATACLYSM segment] who are presiding over a train wreck about to happen. How this movie came to be in the form it exists as may be one of the great puzzles of the 1980's. If you are looking for meaningful plots, convincing performances and deft filmmaking, this title is not advised. But if you want a movie that will demand repeat viewings, elicit repeat laughter & cheers as well as jeers, this DVD is the best money you can spend on entertainment this side of ZOMBIE LAKE or KING KONG VERSUS GODZILLA.Of additional note: (...)",

Yes, the demonic bug, rattling head, claymation monsters, and maniacal Richard Moll are all highlights.

    "review/text": "Released in '84, &quot;Night Train To Terror&quot; was an instant late night horror cult classic. It enjoyed a following in its day although it has gone on the wayside. But anyone interested in cult classics of horror will really find this rare find appealing. The movie is a series of vignettes, three major cases argued by God and the Devil as a group of punk rockers ride an evening train. Warning: This movie is very gory, violent and scary and rated R. Kids under 16 more or less should not watch this film. Not for the faint of heart.God and the Devil battle over souls in a philosophical &quot;Seventh Seal&quot; sort of way. The first case is Harry Billings (John P. Law)a man caught up in the horrors of a hospital in which patients are unwillingly severed and their body parts encased in jars for donation. Gory and disgusting scenes are rampant as the rest of the movie. The second case is that of a young girl who dreams of fame and fortune. She is made into a porn star by a domineering boyfriend/director. She joins a Death Club which plays a twisted Russian Roulette resulting in the electrocution of a Jimmi Hendrix look-alike. That scene is veyr disturbing and not intended for younger viewers. Actually, it is very unnecessary but the director of this film was getting away with nudity, violence and gore because it was late night. The last case is that of Claire Hansen, a faithful God-fearing woman, married to an atheist scientist who has written a controversial book &quot;God Is Dead&quot;. The segment opens with a nightmare sequence involving the Nazis in World War II days. The final confrontation between good and evil collide as Claire faces the Devil's son. The claymation here is used for the images of demons (including one female demon named Ishtar). This movie is very bad if you really think about it but then again many bad movies have enjoyed popularity. As far as horror film goes, this film is a rare cult classic that appears tame and even intellectual in a &quot;talky&quot; way compared to the slice and dice slasher films of today with less plot.",

    "review/text": "\"Night Train to Terror\" is a wretched combination of (apparently) three horrendously bad movies which have been edited down to a singular completely incoherent plot, with links added featuring good versus evil on a model train scheduled by Satan to crash at dawn, all combined in the format of a wretched music video from the 1980s, complete with breakdancing.The first storyline concerns a man who kills his wife by driving off a bridge, and who then becomes involved in a plot to remove organs (only from attractive women) and sell them to medical schools. Plot emphasis is on random gore (including the most unrealistic beheading ever), bad dreams, and lots of screaming, all tied together with no production values.After an intermission from the debate club on the train where horrible dialogue is exchanged (sample: \"You have no tears; you don't know how to cry.\"; \"I can laugh and cry at the same time.\") interspersed with more of the same horrendous pop song and stock footage of a steam locomotive, the film progresses to subplot two, \"The Case of Gretta Connors,\" which starts at a carnival with Gretta selling popcorn. Needless to say Gretta is a struggling musician and actress who only lives for stardom and playing the piano. She is quickly seduced by the evil George Youngmeyer, who puts her in risque movies. The oldest fraternity brother in history, Glenn, sees one of her films and falls in love with her. He then tracks her down (today this is called stalking) and they fall in love. George is furious and vows revenge. He involves them in something called \"The Death Club\" where members try to die in creative ways. I will tell you that while this movie is generally only worth one star (if that), I gave it a bonus star for the most hilarious special effect since \"Robot Monster,\" namely the claymation \"Tanzanian Winged Beetle\" which could not be made funnier if they tried. The electrocution computer is also ludicrous as it melts the face of its randomly selected club member: watch for the classic line \"Excuse me while I smoke.\" What isn't clear is why Glenn and Gretta decided to participate in this club if they were so in love and had such a lust for life. Also watch for the endless pontification on the subject of a wrecking ball, and a special guest appearance by Mark Ridley as Prince Flubutu.After yet more singing the same old song and even more breakdancing, the case of Claire Hansen delves into a confusing and sacrilegious subplot about good versus evil in Nazi Germany, which segues into an extended disco and claymation debacle of epic proportions. It's kind of like \"The Omen\" combined with \"Can't Stop The Music.\" This story was the most pretentious and the most boring. Fortunately it's only a half hour until the train wreck, which features a terrible scale model which would embarrass the producers of the Godzilla series. Finally, after a bit more pompous pontification, we get to see yet more of the song (\"Everybody's got something to do, everybody but you!\"), and after another round of breakdancing the credits roll, and not a moment too soon.Although I am a hardened veteran of numerous B-movies, I found this one trying in the extreme: it took me four attempts to make it all the way through this mess. It turns out that when you put three otherwise awful films together into a single cinematic work that the synergistic effect does not improve them: to the contrary, the net result is one of the most jaw-droppingly bad films in memory.I do not recommend this movie for humans.",

    "review/text": "Well, I'm very sure that by today's horror standards, Night Train To Terror, released in 1984, is tame, but there were moments in the film that were genuinely frightening in its intensity. On DVD, it has been restored to look crisp and new, with great sound. It all begins with a train ride where abet between God and the Devil, a classic theological theme (as presented in the Book of Job)triggers a series of horror vignettes. The struggle between good and evil abounds in these stories. The first tale is of a man who becomes a guinea pig for a group of doctors who cut off body parts (without anesthesia) to sell them off to schools. The second story is about a wayward young girl who gets trapped in the world of pornography and a deadly cult who play a fatal game of Russian Roulette. This particular one is awfully disturbing, especially a scene in which a Jimmy Hendrix type is electrocuted to a crisp. This material is R-rated and I sense this film probably aired late nights on TV or cable in the 80's. The last story is about a courageous woman whose husband is the Devil incarnate who was also a former Nazi officer. The heroine defeats the devil with a box made of the True Cross. The whole thing is a mixture of cult campiness and 80's nostalgia. The song \"Dance With Me\" is straight out of early MTV as the young kids dance on the train that is awaiting a collision. Not for the faint of heart.",

The general idea of the movie (e.g. God and Satan bartering over souls) is interesting but this movie does not pull it off very well. The only thing that keeps it remotely interesting are the short parts with gore that is so fake and funny you end up laughing your ass off (clay animation anyone?).

Here he is gently underplayed by Berger whose dignified portrayal is one of his best performances.Whether madness or medicine we will never know but our sympathy for this tormented man is enlisted from the start. How much is historically accurate I am not sure but it seems to follow the well known facts and presents them dressed in all the splendour of the day.Visconti strikes the right note from the very start with sumptuous costumes, ultra romantic settings, and beautiful actors - he has a craftsman's grip on his subject and never once does he allow the film to descend into a clich&eacute;d costume drama, nor does the usually irritating dubbing have any detrimental effect on the overall enjoyment of this film - all this accompanied by the strains of Wagner's monumental music and what more could you ask for?The DVD is value for money, picture quality and sound are excellent and there is a bonus disc containing a documentary on Visconti. A must have for any serious movie collection.",

    "review/text": "I was fascinated and amazed by this movie which evokes so perfectly what I have learned of this intriguing king during visits to Bavaria and his castles and what I've read about him. His rather sad life and mysterious, tragic death vie with his extravagance and at times to his duties as King. His relationship with Wagner was most interesting and clearly each \"fed\" off the other - the King wanting this connection with the artist whose work he so admired and the composer who frankly needed the money and didn't like to live in penury.The stage musical Ludwig II, performed for some years in the specially-constructed memorial theatre in Fussen, was equally fascinating, with some clever on-stage ideas and glorious music. A show well worth seeing if you ever get the chance.Both highly recommended.",

    "review/text": "Luchino Visconti' s cinematography is extremely interesting to analyze because of the fact, he is just one of the few directors in the cinema' s history that demands from the viewer a compelling vision, that ranges an impressive sort of artistic disciplines, (such as Robert Bresson, Andrei Tarkovsky, Carl Dreyer, David Ward Griffith, Jean Renoir among the most representative ones) who embodied what Wagner meant by total art.In this sense, Ludwig is one of the most ambitious films ever made. You must be prepared to watch a movie that tells us a story enrooted in a crucial historical period, so you must know what happened in Germany after the 1848' s conflict, the life of Richard Wagner, the complex relations between him and Nietzsche, the historical moment is determinant, Wagner is preparing his Tristan, but the main aspect to remark is that possibly as never before we have the most brutal portrait of any other monarch before the art after the bloody French revolution,Visconti becomes aware his tribulations, grandness delirious, as well as his gradual breakthrough with his surrounding and ominous reality, his interior conflicts, his not corresponded love with his cousin; so lyrically expressed by Visconti through an emblematic game of shades and lights, his efforts for trying to return the art its authentic importance into the social body, Ludwig is conscious about that; all of us know about how the trivialization of the arts achieved an undeserved place around the world. To restore the antique dignity and sheer relevance to the art was the main reason that led Ludwig to build Bayreuth in 1876 for Wagner's sake.And Visconti - who also was a true aristocrat of the visual arts - you may realize about his visible sumptuousness, the winged elegance in what his characters displace, the particular tempo in which Visconti displays the story, the breathtaking landscapes, the formidable angle shots and the poetic language makes an artistic wholeness in which the voluptuousness, solitude, desperation and decadence are certainly a part of it.So, when you are ready to watch this supreme artistic legacy, take your time and get into an universe completely different. There have been two notable directors in the actuality who have been captivated for Visconti' style, because they are aware how effective and expressive results: Coppola (establish by yourself the surprising analogy around the use of the game of lights and shades in the most intimate sequences of the Godfather I, and Martin Scorsese in The age of innocence), but the style will never be achieved by simple imitation, due it's the final product of a Cosmo vision.At the moment to make a scrutinizing selection of the most important films of the seventies, include this one and the Innocent (the swan's song' Visconti) among the most pyramidal ones.",

A great character piece that paints complicated portraits of its character both both good, bad, and neurotic.

Toni Collete as always gives an incredible performance alongside quasi walking legend Piper Laurie, Mary Steenburgen, Giovanni Ribisi, Kerry Washington, and many others including stand out performances by an amazing Mary Beth Hurt and a right on target Brittany Murphy (nobody does almost-insane and/or drugged out better than her).

    "review/text": "Karen Moncrief has written and directed this terrifying, searching, agonizing, and exceptionally fine story of the responses of five different people to the discovery of a dead girl. By dividing her story into chapters named after The Stranger, The Daughter, The Mother, The Wife, The Sister, and The Dead Girl she offers us fully realized characters, each of whom is affected by the opening discovery of a mutilated young dead girl's body. The technique of non-linear film is not new, but Moncrief raises it to a new, powerful level, a fact that makes this film one of the more sophisticated and successful of the past few years.Arden (Toni Collette) is a homely frail girl who accidentally discovers the dead girl, taking a necklace from the corpse before reporting the discovery to the police. She is a caretaker for an invalid, foul-mouthed cruel mother (Piper Laurie) who berates Arden for being so ugly and for involving them in a murder case. Arden flees, meets The Stranger Rudy (Giovanni Ribisi), a tattooed, scary appearing guy who is attracted to Arden because she appears so innocent. He courts her with tales of serial killer manners and yet eventually gains Arden's fractured self-perception trust with physical contact. The next chapter introduces Leah (Rose Byrne) who works with Derek (James Franco) in the mortuary where the dead girl's body has been deposited for autopsy. Leah discovers markings on the dead girl that convince her this is the sister who has been missing for 15 years, a fact that her parents (Mary Steenburgen and Bruce Davison) refuse to accept. Leah's tenuous hold on reality is altered by Derek's consolation and physical attention.The Wife episode offers a view of Mary (Mary Beth Hurt) and Carl (Nick Searcy), a married couple with mutual distrust: Mary knows Carl has flings with prostitutes while Carl feels Mary is too controlling. Mary discovers a chest of torn bloody underwear in one of their business Storage Containers, connects the items with Carl in a suspicion that Carl may be related to the death of the dead girl, and burns them. In The Mother we finally meet the true mother Melora (Marcia Gay Harden) of the dead girl Kritsta (Britanny Murphy) as she traces the clues from the body to a seedy motel where she meets Rosetta (Kerry Washington), Krista's roommate and lover, only to discover that the dead Krista ran away from home to become a prostitute and drug addict in response to a childhood abuse problem with her father. Melora is informed that Krista has an illegitimate three-year-old daughter Ashley whom Krista loved and Melora seeks to care for the only remains of the dead girl - her granddaughter and her lover.This film beams with brilliant performances: Collette, Harden, Byrne, Laurie, Hurt, Searcy, Washington, Steenburgen, Franco and Ribisi are poignant in their depiction of damaged people whose lives are altered by the Dead Girl. This is ensemble acting of the finest category. The production values are strong and the director's control of what could have been a meandering saga is firm and keeps the story from becoming sensationalized. This is yet another brilliant little film that deserves a very wide audience. Grady Harp, May 07",

    "review/text": "Several seemingly unrelated individual vignettes culminate to form THE DEAD GIRL, including a piece on the victim herself.The first story surrounds the mundane and abusive life of Arden (Toni Collette,Little Miss Sunshine). Mrs. Collette gives a stunningly fine dramatic performance, moving fully away from her recent comedic roles. She is the discoverer of the dead girl's body, but she doesn't report it right away. Found not far from her shabby home where she lives with her scornful mother, Arden takes a few mementoes away from the dead girl's final resting place before notifying the police. Her mother is livid about Arden's find and just wished that she'd left the dead girl alone without telling anyone about her. There is an unseen tie between Arden and her mother (played by Piper Laurie), but the death of an infant (probably Arden's) is quickly surmised. This \"other death\" eats at Arden and her mother's relationship, feeding guilt to one and anger to the other. Arden's celebrity status (\"That's the one who found the dead girl\") also peaks the love interest of Rudy (Giovanni Ribisi,10th and Wolf), a town local who soon learns how mentally damaged Arden really is.The effect of the dead girl is then transferred to the medical examiner's office where we meet Leah (Rose Byrne,28 Weeks Later). Leah (an M.E. herself), along with her mother and father, have yet to come to grips with the disappearance of Leah's sister some 15 years earlier. Leah believes the dead girl to be her long, lost sibling while her mother and father (especially her mother) refuse to believe it. The family tension is palpable here and much credit must go to director Karen Moncrieff for \"keeping it real.\"We then run into Carl (a distant husband played by Nick Searcy) and his wife Ruth (Mary Beth Hurt,Lady in the Water). Ruth is terribly embittered because of Carl's absences, and she believes her strong religious philosophies are being tested when she finds some disturbing clues as to Carl's activities while he's away. It is Carl whom you want to keep a close eye on throughout the film.The discovery as to the dead girl's true identity is finally meted out and her mother, Melora (Marcia Gay Harden) comes to I.D. the body and discover why her daughter ran away from home. Guilt, shame, fear, and redemption await those who stick it out and finish watching what happens to Melora as she learns the truth behind her daughter's roughshod life and what lay beyond her final resting place.And then we get to meet Krista (Brittany Murphy,Happy Feet), The Dead Girl herself. Interlocking all the other storylines with Krista is a pretty phenomenal piece of cinematic work, and it is done effortlessly. The connections are made in whiplash quick fashion so watching the final segment may take a few viewings before all watchers actually \"get it.\" Krista's prostitute life is not relegated to \"the hooker with a heart of gold\" cliche. She is not the best person to hang around with, but she is a \"real\" human being who makes poor decisions, good ones, and one, final, fatal choice.The Dead Girl is not a thriller. It doesn't show the murder nor have men with chainsaws jumping out from behind trees to cut-up our nearly naked victim. It is a slow immersion into the terrible lives of these messed up folks. Don't get me wrong: this film isn't without tension. It has PLENTY. It's just not the type your sixteen-year-old will be used to and will probably fall asleep watching.The ensemble cast, I think, speaks to how motivated the actors were to do this project and make it an effective piece of cinema. All of the cast were spot-on in their character portrayals and it is these characters that drive the entire production.",

The mother of the victim fearlessly seeks the truth about her troubled, lost daughter's life including the shocking discovery of why the girl left home in the first place. Above all the best segment is the last... the actual experiences of the victim during her last days alive.A well acted, dark & mysterious movie... a bit depressing yet there are small rays of hope.

The movie itself is in five parts which is told from the point of view of the different characters in the movie. \"The Stranger\" revolves around Toni Collette who plays Arden, a homebody & plain woman who is caring for her emotionally abusive aging mom, played to great effect by Piper Laurie. Arden finds the 'dead girl' and takes the necklace on the corpse as her own treasure. She also engages in some creepy conversation & sex with a guy she met at a grocery store, played by Giovanni Ribisi.\"The Sister\" is about Rosie Byrne who plays a sibling who is tortured by her parents' continuous grieving for a sister abducted 15 years ago. She also works in the pathology lab, and thinks the \"dead girl\" could be her long-lost sister.She plays someone who is desperately seeking closure and an end to the endless hope of her parents [her mom is played by Mary Steenburgen].\"The Wife\" was the most chilling part in the movie...it centers around a woman who is loud and abrasive and whose husband goes on mysterious trips out of town and they both manage a storage place. She takes over for him on one of his trips, and makes a startling discovery in one of the storage spaces, which in turn leads to an interesting if morally questionable decision on her part.\"The Mother\" focusses on Marcia Gay Harden who plays the mother of the \"dead girl\" and her grief is very palpable and touching to watch. She takes the initiative to trace her daughter's last residence and meets Kerry Washington, who plays a hooker and drug addict who was also her daughter's best friend/lover.\"The Dead Girl\" takes a look at the last hours in the life of the victim, played convincingly by Brittany Murphy [one of her best performances so far]...the last frame was truly chilling to watch.Overall, I found this to be a compelling movie with a tightly-woven plot. The excellent casting added to the emotional depth of the movie and each character was convincingly fleshed out.A worthwhile addition to the thriller genre.",

Since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS nearly 20 years ago, we have been bombarded with the serial killer in film over and over. Sometimes something good like SEVEN comes along, but most of the time its by-the-book blood and mayhem that only gives a lame story a convenient excuse. Oh, it's a serial killer.In this movie, we travel back and forth in time to see how one really messed-up girl's murder affects friends, family and total strangers.If two of the stories had better conclusions (not easier, just better), I would've given this movie 5 stars. The first one, THE STRANGER, is interesting and definitely well-acted...but it just stops, it doesn't end. I wanted to know more. I was hoping for something better for her. Same for THE WIFE. Mary Beth Hurt plays a middle-aged house frau who watches her sinister husband go out night after night, leaving her to keep their miserable, loveless lives going. She thinks he's just frequenting prostitutes...until she finds a dresser filled with bloody trophies like slashed underwear. (I didn't even know it was Ms. Hurt until the end titles! I remember lusting after her as the girlfriend/wife from THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP back in '82! She really becomes this sad character in this movie.)I guess the complaint I have is that these two stories didn't give me enough of these characters. And I wanted more.The other stories are filled with authentic performances and gritty details. Unfortunately, I knew a girl just like The Dead Girl. Fortunately, she pulled it together...and survived the streets. But she could've ended up like the girl in this movie.You never see The Dead Girl's murder. Or see Ashley Judd or Morgan Freeman heading up the investigation to bring the killer in, or any investigation, for that matter. But you do see how far reaching a senseless murder can go and the damage it does beyond its sad victim.",

    "review/text": "The film should have a warning label. Anyone struggling with depression should not watch this movie. Few movies about serial killers are happy affairs, so what's the problem? It would seem that every character is in some stage of being off kilter beginning with the gruesome opening when Arden (Toni Collette) finds the decaying remains of a young woman in a field near her home. She is shy and intimidated by the attention and publicity given her. A clerk in a grocery store asks her out on a date, but is freaked out when Arden suggests he manhandle her. This opening act is followed by 4 more (I think) where the characters are linked to the dead girl. Although I'm not familiar with the writer/director Karen Moncrieff, even casual movie goers would recognize the cast: Piper Laurie, Giovanni Ribisi, Rose Byrne, James Franco, Mary Steenburgen, Bruce Davison, Mary Beth Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Kerry Washington, Brittany Murphy, Josh Brolin and others. Obviously the actors trusted Ms. Moncrieff. How else do you get Collette doing the \"full monty\" and a nearly 60 year old Mary Beth Hurt going topless?This is conflictingly what is right and what is wrong about the film. Each actor is brilliant and manages to chew up their role, small though it is in all cases. At the same time, I felt like I was watching individual performances rather than a cohesive story. There's nothing wrong with the detachment of the characters and how they ultimately fit into the dead girl premise, it's just that so much information is missing along the way. I did like the chapter where Hurt's character discovers her husband's secret. Her response and her ultimate plan of action were creepy and interesting. While the parts are very good, the whole of the movie is just a little lacking. Now, where's my Zoloft?",

There isn't one character who isn't tragically flawed; instead, the film presents an unbroken chain of murky, polluted existences. Few of the characters even exhibit a potential for improving themselves or their lives. The movie is almost beyond depressing, because it's all too real.Within this web of misery, there are some strong acting performances. Old pros Piper Laurie and Mary Beth Hurt portray grasping, whiny matriarchs. Toni Colette shines as a trampled flower of a character, a shy woman who hides a masochistic streak. And Brittany Murphy--yes, the much-maligned Brittany Murphy--is extremely good as the hard-living murder victim (seen in retrospect).Director Karen Moncrieff purposely dispenses with all the cliches that allow viewers to vicariously enjoy \"serial killer\" flicks. There are no super-monsters like Hannibal Lecter, pursued by heroic FBI profilers. Instead we get a pool of unrelenting squalor, and the characters who swim through it, trying to stay afloat.In the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, \"Human, all too human.\" Those looking for virtue need go elsewhere.",

That being said, his part wasn't the biggest, nor was it the best. He did the best he could with the part given, but his segment (the movie is divided into 5 segments) was mainly focused on Rose Byrne's story. She gives an excellent performance, likely the best in the film.The 4 remaining performances, all centered on women, are held together by strong female performances. I found Toni Collette's part to be the most emotionally touching, and Brittany Murphy does a good job as well. She was a bit over indulgent at times, but I have always admired her acting skills. This movie was no exception.Overall, the movie was pretty depressing. The story was moving and engrossed me, but I can't say that I would recommend it unless you are a die hard fan of one of the actors. The plot is interesting, but the acting is the real story.",

There is no comic relief, no moments of hope. The shock of the movie is the beginning scene, and from there the movie moves slowly down to its inescapable ending.Most of the characters are drowning in their inability to cope with their lives. One woman in a miserable marriage destroys evidence that would implicate her husband in a hideous crime. She would rather continue living with this monster than be alone. Another woman who shows great kindness to others is married to a child molester. A third character showers her daughter with unbelievable verbal abuse. The seriously flawed and failing woman who is the dead girl comes across as one of the few likable people in this film.Most of these people are sinking in the quicksand of life. Yet this is a fascinating piece of work, and the actors are masterful. If you enjoy this movie (is \"enjoy\" really the right word to use?) you should also see Junebug, and Vera Drake. Don't see all three at one time, though. You might have to start taking anti-depressants.",

    "review/summary": "Better and Deeper than a CSI Episode",
    "review/text": "The blurb on this DVD jacket implies the movie is a forensic science mystery. This is very misleading. Don't get this movie if that would be your sole interest in it. Yes, a body is discovered here, and there is a scene or two showing the Medical Examiner probing the corpse for clues. But these scenes are minor moments in the film. This movie is essentially about the transformations wrought in the people surrounding the dead girl.It's all women who are shown being touched by the death. So for some viewers, that might skew this movie in the direction of being a \"chick flick.\" But the film is actually in a genre all its own, beyond classification.In the sort of flat commentary that's included in the bonus materials, filmmaker Karen Monrieff steers us to the conclusion that these are stories about redemption. She suggests that the transformations catalyzed by the girl's death are all positive ones. One proposed subtitle for the film is: \"One Life Ends; Six Others Begin.\" I'm not so sure about that though.All the women depicted do start from utterly bleak places. Possibly the worst condition of initial entrapment is seen in the vignette starring Toni Collette and Piper Laurie. Laurie plays the ultimately controlling mother who is grinding her caretaking daughter into dust in the suffocating closeness of their dingy, curtained house. When Collette is the one to discover the dead body in a nearby field, the resulting notoriety she gets brings her into contact with the outside world. Specifically, it brings her the attentions of a store clerk who has a morbid interest in serial killers. The two unworldly, childlike adults tentatively work their way towards a romance.However, it's difficult to be convinced that this will be a turn-for-the-better for Collette in the long run. Her boyfriend seems to be all too fascinated with the details of serial killings. One gets the feeling she might be exchanging a metaphorical entombment for a literal one.So while I don't find all these vignettes to be necessarily life-affirming, I did find them all to be absorbing and worth watching. The final vignette tracing back to show the dead girl's fate is especially touching.The acting is realistic and inspired throughout. But the photography is truly brilliant. Much of the drama is filmed using appropriately dim lighting. But then a unique outlining effect is used at key moments. The actor's faces are limned in light. They become silhouettes, unknowable quantities hung against a universal background glow.",

    "review/text": "I was at first put off by the title and premise of this film, but after reading so many positive reviews from credible sources, I thought I would give the film a look. It is definitely a film you have to be in the mood for, and you will most likely be in a mood for a while after seeing it.It is a film divided into 5 stories whose respective main characters - on the surface - seem to have no direct relation to those in the other stories, yet they all do have a connection to the central plot which is interwoven into each of the stories.The first story deals with the incidental discovery of the title character's corpse by Arden (Toni Collette) who is a lonely and socially handicapped care-giver for an abusive relative (Piper Laurie) whose sadism and cruelty is limited only by her physical disability. During the course of her mundane and miserable day, Arden also achieves two other relatively significant (though still somewhat troubling in their manner) milestones in her otherwise bleak and dismal life.Another chapter features a medical student (Rose Byrne) working a shift in the Coroner's office. When a young woman's corpse turns up at the morgue, there are indications that lead the med student to believe that the body might be that of her long-missing sister, who disappeared when they were children. Her need and efforts to find out the truth of the matter becomes a consuming obsession with her own emotional well-being at stake.The next vignette features a dysfunctional couple - presumably married (though possibly common law) - whereby the woman (Mary Beth Hurt) is alternately a passive-aggressive nag and whining martyr-wannabe and inveterate enabler who is annoying from the get-go. The man (Nick Searcy) is a no-account, shiftless loser with a penchant for impromptu, late-night travels that last for days and offer few details. Although his mannerisms are less grating and more reserved than hers, there are eerie inferences that he may possess another side to his otherwise banal disposition.The fourth story features a woman (Marcia Gay Harden) who has been informed that the body of a young woman found dead has been identified as that of her daughter. The grieving woman travels across the country from her small town to the seedy and lurid underbelly of the big city. It is during this heartbreaking trek that she begins to take on the role of ad hoc gumshoe, in order to find out as much information as she can about her deceased daughter. During the course of her inquiries, she discovers that she has a granddaughter who she then becomes determined to find.Finally, there is the last vignette featuring a young woman (Brittany Murphy) who is in single-minded, reckless pursuit of two quests of very different purposes and natures.The characters in the film are a departure from the standard Hollywood fare of likable, affable, and heroic protagonists. Of these, only the dead girl's mother is one the audience can really connect with and feel a sense of empathy as well as sympathy towards. She is not necessarily imbued with any particular strengths or exceptional character traits, but she is a decent and compassionate person who has suffered a great deal, first from the news of her daughter's death and then from the revelations about her daughter's life. A few others - such as the father (Bruce Davison) of the missing girl, and possibly the co-worker (James Franco) of the missing girl's sister - could also possibly be considered likable, though the audience really doesn't get much of a chance to know them. A few others can be considered sympathetic, such as the missing girl's mother (Mary Steenbergen), whose efforts to maintain a seemingly incessant (if not convincing) air of hope for her missing daughter still being alive have an almost oppressive effect on her other daughter's efforts to accept the tragedy and begin the slow and painful but necessary process of healing by accepting and moving forth. It is a strange but coldly pragmatic paradigm in which the sister's hopes and optimism hinge on confirmation of her sibling's death rather than embracing the remote possibility that she may still be alive. These two women can be considered sympathetic, but this is most likely borne out of our empathy for them rather than any particular virtue they display.Other characters invoke ambivalence at best, such as a creepy convenience store clerk (effortlessly played by Giovanni Ribisi) who in spite of his interest in serial murder cases and trivia, is the only source of positive attention (relatively speaking) that Arden seems to receive. Although one is inclined to feel pity for Arden's deplorable situation, she also tends to alienate the audience with her own considerable personality shortcomings. Another character who doesn't quite seem to inspire sympathy or enmity is Rosetta (Kerry Washington), a junkie & prostitute whose nihilistic outlook and self-destructive lifestyle have reduced her soul to a mere husk. The remaining characters in the film evoke utter contempt or outright abhorrence for their despicable lack of morality and/or their actions which run the gamut from appalling to horrific.Finally, a mention of praise for Brittany Murphy. She portrays a very different type of character than what she has done previously, although it is ironically just a minor supporting role. Yet, for those of us who have always liked and remembered Brittany Murphy for her familiar combination of quirky humor and offbeat beauty, this role is a big departure which pays off as a gamble for displaying her range of characters and acting ability. She even undergoes such a different physical appearance for the role that it takes a fraction of a moment to remember that it is her and not another actress. Her character in this film is not a likable or even a very sympathetic one, although she is not completely without a potentially redeeming quality.This film is well made, in terms of both technical competence and artistic merit. The writing and direction are skillful. The acting is effective, and in some cases engaging. However, it is more thought-provoking and emotionally evocative than it is likable. Due to the brutally unsentimental content and thoroughly depressing nature of the stories, this film's appeal may be limited.In fact, it is a film that will be more likely appreciated rather than enjoyed.",

Performances are provided by a cast of mostly seasoned actors, the most moving of them being Marcia Gay Harden, who gives a devastatingly understated portrayal of the victim's mother. While all the episodes are unnerving, perhaps the darkest is the gradual revelation of the killer.

    "review/text": "\"The Dead Girl\" offers a rather unexpected piece of storytelling. Actor-turned-filmmaker Karen Moncrieff knocked the wind out of my sails with Blue Car, her 2002 debut about a teenager who transforms a troubled home life into an uncanny ability to write poetry. After working on episodes of Six Feet Under and the woefully short-lived American version of Touching Evil, Moncrieff returns with an even more impressive feature about a young woman who, as the title suggests, isn't quite as lucky at escaping the dark elements of her existence.Unlike Rashomon, that great Japanese film in which a crime is recalled differently by a number of witnesses, \"The Dead Girl\" uses the victim as a trigger to ignite each part of the movie. The titular prostitute is played by Brittany Murphy, though we mostly view her as a corpse (it's her best performance ever!) because Moncrieff unfurls the tale in a series of vignettes that show the impact her death has on people she's never spoken to or even met. Like, for example, the person who discovers the body (Toni Collette) or the morgue worker who is forced to re-open some upsetting familial wounds.First we meet Arden (Toni Collette), a shy spinster who suffers daily humiliation from her demanding invalid mother (Piper Laurie, doing a riff on her crazy-mama shtick from Brian De Palma's Carrie). However, Arden's bleak existence gets considerably more interesting after she finds a dead body covered with ants. She even becomes daring enough to take up with an aggressive stranger (Giovanni Ribisi), and we can't help worrying that he might be the killer. Next, our attention shifts to Leah (Rose Byrne), who works in the morgue and thinks the corpse might be her missing sister. And our heart goes out to this sad, neglected daughter of a mother (Mary Steenburgen) obsessed with finding her long-lost child. We are then allowed a harrowing glimpse into Ruth's (Mary Beth Hurt) extremely unhappy marriage to Carl (Nick Searcy), who frequently leaves her alone while he takes mysterious trips. When Ruth finds evidence to implicate her husband in the serial killing of young girls, we wonder what she will do about it and are shocked at how she handles her horrific discovery. The fourth segment centers on Melora's (Marcia Gay Harden) efforts to deal with her devastating guilt over failing to listen to her daughter (Brittany Murphy) and her search for a little granddaughter(Elle Fanning) she didn't know existed.Finally, we discover what really happened to 'the dead girl' as well as the misery this murder caused her close friend Rosetta (Kerry Washington, wonderful but barely recognizable in this role). You may wonder why such a group of actors would flock to a little-known filmmaker like Moncrieff as if she were Spielberg or Scorsese, but the work they do for her puts a feather in each of their caps so there should be no regrets. The female performances are what really save this film. Even with a weak screenplay, the ladies never fail while bringing to the screen their characters. \"The Dead Girl \" is a very unconventional way to tell a story we've seen about a million times, and for that (along with the lean 94-minute running time), I am thankful. Keep an eye on Moncrieff - she's the real deal.",

It begins with Toni Collette as a shy caretaker of an abusive old woman. When she finds the body of the murdered woman she is shocked and fascinated. She realizes that life is too short to be sitting in one place letting other people make you feel worthless and she acts. The movie continues with the ME preparing the body. The ME thinks that the dead girl could be her missing sister. Her life and that of her family has been frozen since her sister went missing. Her parents won't accept that their daughter might be dead. This weighs heavily on their remaining daughter who only wants to get on with her life, but this obsession with finding her sister overwhelms her. We also get to meet the dead woman's mother, her roommate, and the dead girl herself. I've never seen a movie quite like this and I found it an interesting character study and mystery.",

    "review/text": "Short Attention Summary Span:1. There is a girl who is found dead by a caretaker. It turns out that the caretaker has an abusive mother, and finding the dead girl is a catalyst for her moving out and starting her own life.2. It was initially thought by a family that the dead girl was their own (long missing daughter). It turned out to not be-- but this was not enough to stop the surviving daughter from bringing closure to a long and painful ordeal.3. From there, we move to an unhappily married husband and wife. The husband disappears for long periods of time with no explanations. It happens just by chance one day that the wife finds that the husband is killer by fortuitous discovery of the evidence that he has kept for his crimes. She does not report him to the police and burns the evidence.4. The movie then goes into the mother (of the murdered girl) going back and finding out what kind of life her daughter lived-- and what drover her away from home. Along the way, she finds that the daughter had a child-- that she decides to keep.5. Finally, we get to see the events leading up to the death of the girl (her life as a prostitute) and it is proved that the man that we saw earlier was indeed the killer.Comments:This was a brilliant film. Brillant writing and brilliant acting.1. There were several plots and several resolutions, but they were introduced one at a time. Many movies that have several subplots make the resolutions all at once in the end. But these resolutions were made at the end of every vignette and that made for a refreshing change.2. The film was obviously lower budget, but the acting and writing made up for that. (This is as opposed to a lot of films that have a high budget that can't cover up a crappy plot.)3. There were a lot of unresolved elements-- which was somewhat unsatisfying. But on the other hand, the fact that these existed prevented the movie from being hackneyed.4. The acting was generally very strong and the characters were well cast and very believable.This is worth an evening movie ticket.",

    "review/text": "The Dead Girl (2006) is a thoughtful and poignant film that features five separate stories that are all related to a single event, the murder of a young woman. Written by Karen Moncrieff, the stories resonate and touch the heart to varying degrees, while mostly reflecting a female point of view. The sensitivity of the writing and the meaty characters, are no doubt why the film garnered such a superb cast, and contains such deep and emotional performances. While there are more than a few convenient coincidences, and some segments are stronger than others, the overall story holds together nicely, and presents a unique perspective of a tragedy. Most who view the film can't help but be touched to some extent. (Some mild spoilers follow)The story is told non-chronologically, and begins with \"The Stranger\", where a woman named Arden (Toni Collette) discovers the dead body of a woman on the farm where she lives with her invalid mother (Piper Laurie). After being interviewed on the news, Arden becomes something of a celebrity, a fact that results in only scorn and criticism from her tyrannical and controlling mother. Arden's notoriety leads to her being asked on a date by Rudy (Giovanni Ribisi) a mildly creepy supermarket clerk, which in turn opens a whole new page in both Arden's and her mother's life.Coincidence plays a major factor in \"The Sister\" as Leah (Rose Byrne), a medical student working in the medical examiner's office, believes that the dead woman is her sister, who mysteriously disappeared some 15 years ago. Leah's family has never recovered from the tragedy, an event that still weighs heavily on them all.In \"The Wife\", Mary Beth Hurt plays Ruth, a woman who discovers evidence that her husband Carl (Nick Searcy), who runs a warehouse storage business, is a serial killer. When Ruth confronts him, he admits nothing. Now Ruth must decide what to do.There are probably few, who would not be truly moved by Marcia Gay Harden's heartbreaking performance as Melora Kutcher in \"The Mother\". Harden plays the mother of the dead woman, who has been identified as her daughter Krista. Looking for some closure Melora visits the dingy apartment where Krista lived with her roommate Rosetta (Kerry Washington). The crushing emotional burden of knowing that her daughter was murdered and left naked in a field, gets even heavier when she learns from Rosetta that Krista was a prostitute. One more shock is coming her way, when she discovers that Krista was the mother of a little girl, who is now alone in the world.\"The Dead Girl\" brings the story almost full circle, as we follow Krista (Brittany Murphy) on the last day of her life. She has bought a doll as a birthday present for her daughter, who is staying at a nearby town with a sitter. It's too late to have the doll delivered, so she plans to get a ride and deliver it personally. The nature of Krista's relationship with her roommate Rosetta is clarified, as at the end of a tumultuous day Krista finds herself hitchhiking in need of a ride, when Carl happens by and picks her up.A multi-faceted tale that revolves around a sad tragic event, The Dead Girl pushes a number of emotional buttons, as Karen Moncrieff's terrific screenplay brings forth a number of powerful performances, with Marcia Gay Harden, Mary Beth Hurt, and the late Brittany Murphy, perhaps shining the brightest among them. The Dead Girl is hardly a feel good experience, but is a film is well worth your time.",

It is a movie about different people and how all of their lives are somehow interconnected. A girl is murdered and a woman finds her in the back yard, then she gets in a fight with her mother, goes off and meets a random guy and has sex with him?. Next scene is a girl who works in the morgue where the dead girl's body is taken, and she sees a birthmark resembling that of a sister of her's who went missing years ago. The parents don't believe her and then it turns out it isn't the girl's sister. Then it moves on to the mother of the dead girl coming and identifying the body, which leads her to her estranged daughter's girlfriend and they are both prostitutes who live in a nasty hotel. She finds out that her daughter had a child and goes and gets the little girl. Then there is the scene about the creepy old couple who live in a house near their storage shed business and while the husband is gone the irritated wife finds a dresser in an empty storage unit full of dead women's clothing. She bags it up drives to the police station, sees a cop, then takes it home and burns it and her own clothes, and walks away back to the creepy murderous husband naked! Then at the end there is a flashback scene to how the girl met the killer (old creepy man) while hitch hiking because her loser pimp? boyfriend wouldn't take her to give her daughter a present. Then when the scene comes that the dead girl and murderer are in the car together it just ENDS!! So basically you waste all this time and it ends in such a random spot....I hate this movie and it was a waste of money renting it.",

Normally I like more independent films but sometimes there just so awful and \"boy-are-we-smart\" attitudes that you feel like the more you roll your eyes, the more they'll pop out of your sockets. \"The Dead Girl\" is one of those kind of films where it really shouldn't work and yet everything fits right but not quite enough. There's nothing inherently wrong with the story but it's like performing a long piano piece and hit 2 bad notes, it's like \"argh, so close!\"The movie opens with Arden (Toni Collette) discovering the body of a young girl, Krista (Brittany Murphy) dead in a field. Krista's mother (Marcia Gay Harden) is in town trying to find her as well as finding out some surprising news. A body believed to be Krista's is found by a morgue assistant (Rose Byrne) who's been looking for her sister for years. Krista's killer is slowly being found out by his wife (Mary Beth Hurt).There's different segments to the film and they're all played one at a time so it doesn't suffer that Crash format of having everyone somehow passing by each other. While the characters are all connected, it's not presented in this sort of implausible fashion that really only Robert Altman films can pull off. However, that means that each segment relies on the strength of where it is in the running order and how well done it is. For example, the \"Sister\" segment centering on Byrne is definately my favorite yet the previous segment, \"the Stranger\" which focuses on Collette is kind of boring.The acting though is by-and-large excellent. There's some that are surprising (I always found Rose Byrne underrated yet nobody listens to me) while some are just obvious standouts such as Toni Collette but she's always good. Strangely, the one weak link is the titular character played by Brittany Murphy. Of course, the whole idea of a drugged out/messed up girl doesn't seem like a stretch but sometimes she's almost all over the place, being quietly reflective and subtle than she turns on the hysterics and kind of goes overboard. Sure she avoids the Sean Penn style of overacting but it's kind of distracting. The other I felt was James Franco as the lab assistant who gets involved with Byrne. He didn't feel like someone she should find comfort in since he almost seems more like someone who'd rather keep her in his bed than be a friend.It's probably not a film for everyone. While the indie crowd would love it, it's one of those out of the way films where you'd almost have to overexplain what the whole thing's about. It's best a film you discover on your own or word of mouth and whether it interests you than some guy saying it's \"best movie of the year!\".",

    "review/text": "THE DEAD GIRL takes the typical serial-killer movie and turns it inside-out. Rather than show us the eeevil stalkers and the bloody mess they make, TDG allows us to witness the aftermath. We are given five separate tales showing the effects of murder on family, friends, and total strangers. Brittany Murphy (Sin City) is the doomed title character, Marcia Gay Harden (The Mist) is her devastated mum, Jerry Washington plays her girlfriend, and Josh Brolin is her boyfriend. The rest are strangers who are involved in the story in various ways. Toni Collette (The Night Listener) finds the body. Rose Byrne examines it. Mary Beth Hurt is married to the hollow-soul who just might be responsible. Giovanni Ribisi (The Gift) Mary steenbergen, Piper Laurie (Carrie), and James Franco round out the cast. With so many movies that make serial-killers out to be unstoppable, homicidal genius' and / or anti-heroes, (which I fully admit to enjoying), It's refreshing to see the actual pain they cause and the lasting effects of their actions. I also like the few rays of hope within the hopelessness here. Though some lives are destroyed, others are reborn. THE DEAD GIRL isn't just a faceless victim, she is actually missed...",

Twenty minutes into it I seriously doubted that was going to happen.Though the actors were brilliant, the screenplay intelligent, and the music stirring, I felt the story was disjointed. I couldn't fully get a handle on what the writer was trying to say...until it was over.When it ended (and the ending came sooner than I wanted), as I watched the credits, listening to the eerily beautiful music, I thought about every character in the movie and how much I had been emotionally moved by nearly all of them. How much more I wanted to know about them. How strange that I felt that these people had so much more to say and at the same time I knew that they had said as much as they could.The story wasn't disjointed, it was perfectly laid out and, yes, the film was quite extraordinary. I can't stop thinking about how amazing this would look on a live stage.The Dead Girl needs to be watched twice, at least. Be careful though, it has the ability to suck you down into dark places that aren't so easy to climb out of.You have been warned. Proceed with caution",

A few years ago, it was issued in a wonderful &quot;Collector's Series&quot; widescreen disc with just about everything that is included on the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; (save a promo or two for the sequel). It's out-of-print now, but you should still be able to track it down, and it is worth it. Remember, you want &quot;Collector's Series&quot;, NOT &quot;Deluxe Edition.&quot;As for the movies, well, both are fun. The original is undoubtedly superior, as it's entirely enveloping for young and old alike, with a mix of heartwarming drama and some witty humor. Michael J. Fox is perfectly cast as Stuart, the little mouse with a big heart and a big family. His adventures in New York City are handled with fairy-tale treatment, that also, seems appropriate.The sequel feels a little too formulaic, while not remaining entirely true to the first film at the same time. Overall, it doesn't work as well as the original, but it's very entertaining all the same, and James Woods voices the villain like only he can (his recent resume illustrates that this role is a forte).&quot;Stuart Little 2&quot; contains both Widescreen and Fullscreen on its only release, but you'll want to pass this 2-pack and get the &quot;Collector's Series&quot; (Widescreen) for the original &quot;Stuart Little.&quot; (Rating applies to the DVD 2-Pack.)",

The story itself is just a setup for gore, trash and brief nude scenes setup to entice the viewer. Just think of a very cheap porno movie and you know what production values to expect.The story is about a couple (not really bright as seen by the *ahem* \"twist\" ending) that stumbles upon a town's secret...which I won't spoil. I'll just say that it centers around the production of snuff movies.The acting is poor, very poor. Even if these guys had looked at the script ahead of the time, it wouldn't have changed their performance!!!Of course all this adds to novelty of junk films like this. You love to see how bad they are and thus put them in the classic category of \"it's so bad, it's good\".I will say though that the villians in this flick are disgusting and horrendous and to an extent lifelike of what you would find in the minds of any serial killer. If this was a movie produced on a Hollywood budget with big name actors (think Vacancy), then a movie like this would have gotten more attention.I heard there is a DVD release, but I wouldn't spend a dime on it. For me this is one of those flicks that are at best worth a buck or two and you save them for those special times when you and your buddies are kicking back but not a flick that you would spend money on. The movie has memorable lines at well...including one cameraman who mutters \"did I miss anything\" when he wants to know if he miss any gore that didn't get caught on film.Anyhow, worth a rent for a laugh but nothing more unless you're really into this kind of flicks.",

    "review/text": "When you see a movie collection with Colin Firth, Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett on the front cover (plus Hugh Grant, Jeremy Northam, etc.), you just assume it will be good. Well, it isn't. It's marketing. I already owned an Ideal Husband (on VHS) so saw it was in this DVD collection and assumed the other films would be similar quality. They are not. I own almost every Jane Austen and period movie ever made and love that genre and usually love British cinema, BBC, etc.; however, the only good films out of this 8-movie collection are An Ideal Husband (excellent, 4.5 stars, really fun movie about politics, love, forgiveness, second chances, etc.) and Her Majesty Mrs. Brown (3.5 stars) about Queen Victoria mourning her husband's loss and the Scottish servant who helps her move past her loss. I couldn't even get through the rest of the films -- A Month by the Lake was incredibly boring and pointless with Vanessa Redgrave as an older lady chasing an older man who was flirting with a young nanny (Uma Thurman) and the same basic thing kept happening over and over again -- I had to force myself to watch it. My Life So Far was crass, with an awful performance by Colin Firth as a second-rate, eccentric husband flirting with his brother's wife while his young son looks at naked lady pictures. The Englishman who went up the Hill is okay (3 stars) as it's kind of interesting that a town would put dirt on a hill so it gets taller and can be called a mountain, but most of these movies aren't even the kind I would watch if they were on TV (definitely wouldn't buy or watch again). I haven't watched the others yet -- Restoration, Sweet Revenge or Tom & VIV, so maybe one of those will be good but I'm not expecting much. So far, only 2 of the 8 were worth having. At the price, it's worth buying the set only for An Ideal Husband and Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown unless you can get An Ideal Husband by itself for less. Again, not sure why these films are &#34;acclaimed&#34; as most of them seem pretty poor.",

    "review/text": "All but two of these eight are movies I'd seen on the big screen years ago. Four I'd liked well enough to know I'd want to see them again from time to time--especially Oscar Wilde's \"An Ideal Husband,\" if only for Rupert Everett's hilarious performance. Also Judi Dench as Queen Victoria in \"Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown\" and Vanessa Redgrave's middle-aged war with a very young Uma Thurman for the affections of Edward Fox in \"A Month by the Lake\", and \"My Life So Far,\" based on Sir Denis Forman's memoir of his Scottish childhood*, with Colin Firth as his roving-eyed father.The two I didn't much like the first time I saw them I liked even less the second time. (\"Restoration\" with Robert Downey Jr. and \"The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain\" with Hugh Grant) but I suspect that's a minority viewpoint.The two I was seeing here for the first time made this purchase well worth the buy all on their own. \"Sweet Revenge\" with Helena Bonham Carter, Sam Neill and Kristin Scott Thomas is an absolute hoot and I can't believe I'd never heard of it. \"Tom and Viv\" with Willem Dafoe and Miranda Richardson tells the sad story of author T. S. Eliot's angst-ridden first marriage, back in the days when women with \"female\" problems were diagnosed as mentally ill and carted off to the looney bin.There are no extras--no subtitles, no closed-captioning, no scene indexes. Also, from the product info above you might get the impression that Gerard Butler is Dench's co-star in \"Mrs. Brown.\" Her co-star is Billy Connolly; Butler plays a supporting role as Connolly's brother.*Seeing \"My Life So Far\" again reminded me how very much I've loved the book it's based on,Son of Adam, now also sold under the titleMy Life So Far. I wanted to see if Sir Denis had continued on with his bio and indeed he had, with a World War II memoirTO REASON WHYthat I've just ordered.Addenda 12/31/12: Also, Firth fans please note that, despite his dominance on the cover of this set, he is in only one of these 8 movies and, like all the adult roles in it, plays a supporting role to the wonderful child actor Robert Norman who plays the lead.",

Each is 90 to 118 minutes and all are in widescreen and color. They are loaded with star performers in stellar accomplishments. It is a satisfying mix of comedy, historical drama, romance, and biography. What more can you say except the price is less than renting. And you will want to watch some of the offerings more than once. They are as good as any of the new cinema creations put out today.Restoration: Robert Downey Jr, Meg Ryan, Ian MacKellan, Hugh Grant, and more. London 1663 drama of one mans journey through the light and dark of the period times. R rating for sexuality, nudity. One of the best.An Ideal Husband: A delightful period drama/romance with stellar performances by Minnie Driver & Cate Blanchett. Another of my favorite from this lot.A Month by the Lake: An older (Vanessa Redgrave) lady finds romance in a wonderful adaptation of a story by HE Bates.My Life So Far: Scot lad Fraser lives a somewhat wild childhood and viewers get a very funny accounting of his coming to terms with puberty. Colin Firth is the dad. I'll watch this film again and again.The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a Mountain. What will Welsh townsfolk do to retaliate against surveyors (Ian McNeice, Hugh Grant) claiming their prized local mountain is less than 1000 feet--thus a mere `hill'? Another top winner.Sweet Revenge: 2 souls fail to complete suicides off London's Tower Bridge. They form a pact to play a deadly game of revenge against those that drove them to the brink. Lots of UK stars.Her Majesty, Mrs. Brown: Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) gets close and personal during her grief from losing the King with Mr. Brown, a man who cares for her horses and the emotional state of his queen. True love?Tom & Viv: A very accurate & well done fictional/biographic look a the life of T.S. Eliot (Willem Dafoe), poet with an insane wife.NO SUBTITLES OR Closed Caption--shame on ECHO BRIDGE. No bonus stuff.Yet highly recommended.",

With the exception of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down A Mountain (the only redeeming film in this collection; Hugh Grant portrays the real British style well) the makers of the other 7 have obviously visited Hollywood too many times and have drunk their Kool-Aid. The courseness, vulgarity, even offensiveness in dumbed-down run-on dialogue, babbling idiotic nonsense, and lack of plausible plot is not up to the usual British polish. The 7 films that lack class and levity of the usual British approach obviously came from the hog-pen of the U.S. cinema trough.",

Good romantic plot as well.\"My Life So Far\" with Colin Firth was very good...I would describe it as a bittersweet story about marriage, with a happy ending...presented through the point of view of a child who has a crush on an older woman.Couldn't get into \"The Englishman Who Climbed a Mountain.\" Though Hugh Grant is one of my favorite actors of all time, the subject matter just seemed trivial and silly.\"Restoration\" was just too bawdy for me...within just the first 5 minutes of the film, you see Robert Downey Jr. getting it on most energetically with some tart and I'm just not into that kind of film.Couldn't get into Tom & Viv either for some reason.Her Majesty Mrs. Brown is a quality film, but I guess I've just become bored with films about monarchs and people who loyally served them.",

    "review/text": "Bergman is deeply aware of the gap that separates \"saying\" from \"meaning\". His characters always put honesty before consideration, and this is usually the drama they are faced with. His plots take place in the hiatus that separates the depth of thoughts and feelings from the surface of expression. The soothing, conventional expressions, the high-sounding words of love and gratitude, the hollow and pathetic apologies are never uttered, or when they are they do not come without a sense of betrayal. The most genuine impressions are faked as soon as spoken-- because as soon as they are shaped into words one becomes aware of what one is saying; feeling gives way to acting, and, in an irony that reveals the ambiguity of the very word \"acting\", we, the actors, immediately become spectators of ourselves. We then listen to ourselves speaking, we weigh the words against their meaning and watch ourselves as if from outside while hoping to speak from the inside, and in taking the utmost care to make sure the words and gestures are convincing, we betray them with a false, phony spontaneity. This complex tension between words and meaning, spontaneity and acting, truthfulness and consideration, is the matter of which Bergman's movies -- particularly Scenes from A Marriage, together with its sequence, Saraband-- are made. There's a grain of contempt in every spoken word, Nietzsche said somewhere. In Bergman, each word is spoken as if the speaker, or even the words themselves, were painfully aware of the contempt they carry and the betrayal in which they incur. And because of this they carry a weight and a significance that are rarely to be found today, when the right expression comes instantly on-demand and tailored for the right situation, and words abound full of sound, fury, and little else.",

The sub-plot concerning Henrik's over-reliance on the lovely, talented Karin is heart-rending, as is the nasty, unbridgeable divide between father and son. Ullmann's Marianne, wiser and more observant than in earlier days, calmly tries to make sense of all this dysfunction, right along with us.

    "review/text": "For Bergman devotees like me, any morsel tossed our way by the great master is a treat. Saraband is a good deal more than a morsel, but not the true masterpiece others are claiming. And it takes some investment in Bergman's biography and past works to truly appreciate its depth, I think.As has been pointed out, the film is a tribute to Bergman's late wife, Ingrid (not the actress) and his mourning for her; the film is dedicated to her, and the photograph of \"Anna\" that is lingered on lovingly by the characters throughout the film is actually a portrait of Ingrid. (Bergman made a short film--never released in the US--called \"Karin's Face\"--a tribute to his complicated relationship with his mother, where her photographic portrait is similarly examined by the film camera.)As with Fanny & Alexander, I was intrigued to see how Bergman quotes his past works and themes in this film. The Bach saraband that haunts the soundtrack is the same piece of music he used in Cries and Whispers, when the two estranged sisters temporaily make contact in a montage of carressing hands and faces (Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Thulin), silent except for the lone cello of Bach's saraband.Marianne's institutionalized daughter echoes that of Ingrid (the actress) Bergman's character's in Autumn Sonata. The concluding Scene 10 in Saraband is titled Vargtimme (translated as The Hour Before Dawn)which is also the Swedish title of Bergman's 1968 film \"Hour of the Wolf,\" which also begins and ends with Liv Ullmann speaking intimately to the camera (when she was pregnant with Bergman's daughter).As in The Passion of Anna and Cries and Whispers, a character's secrets are revealed in letters and diaries--things they could never say \"face to face.\"It is a melancholy treat to see Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson together on screen again (much like seeing Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg reunited in Fellini's Intervista many decades later to watch their youthful selves in the famous Trevi Fountain scene in La Dolce Vita). I was reminded how much I've missed Ullmann's magnificent face, now wrinkled with age and experience, which has been absent from the movie screen for far too long.To me it's the film's themes of retrospection, regret, loss and becoming reconciled (or not) with one's past that touched me deeply, something the nearing-90 year-old Bergman is obviously engulfed by.There are other things that disturbed or at least distracted me in Saraband. I must say, as someone else pointed out here, I too was puzzled by the \"bad math\" of Johann and Marianne's history; their ages don't match up with their stated years married and apart. And maybe it's my American puritanical heritage raising its ugly head as I age, but do middle-aged men really sleep in the same bed with their adult daughters in Sweden? Yes, Dad sees Karin as a replacement for his lost wife, but such overt incestuous overtones are over-the-top and unnecessary.And I have never bought into Bergman's trite \"crippled child\" metaphor. Yes, we are all \"institutionalized\" in some way by our parents' actions or inactions, but doesn't he make that point without having to rely on such obvious symbols? Nevertheless, I was moved to tears in the epilogue when Marianne reveals that following her time with Johann and his family, she truly touched her instituionalized daughter [the crippled child metaphor] for the first time. It's Ullmann's performance that overcomes the contrivance.The other thing that makes this film outstanding is Bergman's continued reliance on close-ups--and his camera especially loves women's faces. Even without his now-ailing cinematographer Sven Nykvist, Bergman tells as much about the human condition in close-ups of human faces than all the combined dialogue or contrived metaphors of his and others' films combined.One of the few bonuses in this DVD is a \"Making of...\" documentary. It's intriguing to see how Bergman works with his actors and crew and we learn more about the film's conception in his discussions with them, especially in his recollection of a conversation he had with Erland Josphson that helped him cope with the loss of his wife. And it's interesting, too, to see how Bergman has adapted to the digital age--quite different from the earlier \"Making of...\" docs of his creation of Fanny & Alexander and earlier movies where film was the medium. And I was suprised to see that most of the outdoor scenes were created in the studio--convincingly so.Overall, not Bergman's best, but well worth the investment and a fitting capstone to an amazing career.",

    "review/summary": "As cold as ever; maybe that's the problem",
    "review/text": "At first, \"Saraband\" seems to be a sequel to \"Scenes From a Marriage.\" The main characters are named Johan and Marianne, played by Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann. They were once married for a long time, and had two children together. Then they got divorced, but are still drawn to each other, years later.However, there's a lot of new back-story. Johan now has another son from another marriage. That son has an alienated teenage daughter who has great musical talents, and needless to say, father, son and grand-daughter do not get along. At first, this feels like unnecessary weight hung onto the story of \"Scenes From A Marriage,\" which had enough back-story of its own. But ultimately, I agree with the reviewer who suggested that \"Saraband\" is actually not about the same people at all. The protagonists are a totally different divorced couple, but they happen to also be named Johan and Marianne. It's similar to how Bergman reused names like Vogler and Vergerus in hisearlierfilms.What happens next is pretty much what always happens in Bergman films. The characters engage in horrific emotional abuse. In my review of \"Persona,\" I said that all Bergman films are about people elaborately inflicting emotional suffering on each other. That rule certainly holds here. Johan despises his son, and crudely insults him in conversation. Liv Ullmann, as Marianne, smiles cutely, her dimples twinkling merrily, but her contempt for Johan is even deeper and more subtle. She knows his weaknesses more than anyone else; she humiliated him by moving on to have an extensive sex life after he divorced her, even while he was already beginning to wither away. Many times in this film, it feels like the only reason why she came to see Johan now is to feel her own power and superiority over him one more time. In a powerful scene involving Johan's night terrors, she finally takes pity on him, but even that is really another expression of her victory, since she doesn't intend to take him back.The other major conflict is between Karin and her father. The father is basically a softer, more vulnerable version of the well-meaning but stifling parent figure that Bergman explored in \"Autumn Sonata\" (and just like in that film, music is the nominal reason for the conflict). His extreme emotional neediness is made clear in the nightmarish kissing scene (if there's one scene in \"Saraband\" that stays in one's mind, it's that one), in which the daughter ambiguously seems to relish in the power she has over him.So if you're wondering whether Bergman might have lost his touch in the 20 years that passed between \"Fanny and Alexander\" and \"Saraband,\" you can put your mind at ease. He's in his prime here, as cold and brutal as ever. \"Saraband\" is just as intense as \"Scenes From A Marriage.\"But at the same time, the film's very strength is its weakness. It's another flawless, vicious emotional assault from the master...but that makes it feel exactly like one of his seventies films. It could have easily been made in 1975 with the exact same story and script. The only hint that it was actually made in 2003 can be seen in Karin's contemporary-looking tank top (which she wears with no bra underneath -- oh Ingmar, you've still got it). The tank top is seriously the only sign of the times to be found in the whole film; it stands out so much that it feels out of place. The film takes place in a remote rural region, so there are no traces of modern technology to get in the way of Bergman's trip back in time.The reason why Bergman's perfect seventies recreation is a weakness is because he had actually begun to venture outside this emotional range in \"Fanny And Alexander.\" The latter film was pretty much the only time when Bergman ever took a real interest in something other than senseless cruelty, and depicted other types of human interaction in a believable way. Possibly this was because the film dealt with childhood, which Bergman has felt nostalgic for ever since \"Wild Strawberries.\" In any case, it was a sign that maybe, he was taking steps to move beyond the worldview that he depicted in the seventies.But there are no such signs in \"Saraband.\" In that sense, the film is a step backward, because it really is identical in tone to \"Scenes From A Marriage,\" \"Cries And Whispers,\" \"Persona,\" and \"Autumn Sonata.\" I don't insist that an artist always has to do something different with each new work, but Bergman already showed all these conflicts earlier, and really, how many unrelentingly cruel films do you need to watch before you start to wish there was something more?",

It's certainly not his best film, or even one of his best five films, and I'm certain he didn't intend it as such. It's not an ambitious or original film. Rather it seems to be a 'last dance' with the brilliant actors and actresses whose performances made Bergman the greatest Director per se of cinema history. Whatever resistance you may have toward Bergman's torturous pessimism, whatever your discomfort with his pace of observation and/or his disingenuous detachment, you will have to be astonished at the performances of Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson in \"Saraband\". They 'inhabit' their characters as richly as a goldfinch inhabits its feathers. Ensemble acting, and the direction of actors who knew each other thoroughly as an ensemble, was the core of Bergman's creativity. But \"Saraband\" also features a young actress -- Julia Dufvenius in the role of Josephson's granddaughter -- whose performance is also utterly Bergmanesque. The old Director hadn't lost his touch with actresses!I don't mean to tell you what this film is about, or to critique its moral/psychological message. I merely want to suggest that any film-goer who has esteemed Bergman's greatest poignant works -- Wild Strawberries, Fanny and Alexander, and others -- would be foolish to miss his last saraband.",

    "review/text": "Bergman was a devoted admirer of Strindberg, and as a theatre director produced several of Strindberg's plays. One of the best from Strindberg was \"Dance of Death,\" a two-part drama that explores the tangled webs of hatred and dependency that close relationships can breed. I don't think it's too much to see \"Saraband,\" Bergman's final--and one of his best--film as a dance-of-death themed exploration. It's also the case, of course, that a \"sarabande\" is a dance. In the context of the film, the title also refers to a piece from Bach's 5th cello suite which one of the characters, Karin, plays.The four actors in \"Saraband\"--Johan (Erland Josephson), Marianne (Liv Ullmann), Henrik (Borje Ahlstedt), and Karin (Julia Dufvenius)--are caught in relationships which, although life-craving, are in fact life-destroying. Karin, the daughter of Henrik, is a budding musician to whom the widowed and grieving Henrik poisonously clings (with just a hint of incest thrown in). Henrik, a 60-year old failure, is the son of Johan, who treats him with an icy indifference that's absolutely chilling (at one point, Johan tells Henrik that so far as he's concerned, his son simply doesn't exist). Johan and Marianne, the old couple first encountered in \"Scenes from a Marriage,\" are both alone in their old age, but cling rather desperately to one another in one of the film's final scenes, as though they know that the night is closing in.If there's any hope from the dance of death that they and we must perform, it's represented by Karin's resolution to break from her father, even with the bitter knowledge that their separation will destroy him, and the moment of recognition that Marianne's adult but schizophrenic daughter displays in the film's closing scene. But these two moments of grace must be taken for what they are. The first brings tragedy, the second is fleeting.This film, beautiful to watch and hear, acted with skill and directed by the 87-year old Bergman with a master's touch, is without doubt one of Bergman's very best. It's also his swansong, which makes the message even more poignant.",

His selection of music is a case in point.The second movement of Bach's Fifth Cello Suite (Sarabande), whose excerpts we hear in this film, is intimate and very sorrowful (almost like a piece of funeral music), as if to signal the end of the road. The non-chordal nature of this movement (it consists of a single melodic line) was a great way to subtly remind us of the existential loneliness of the four main characters, as well as our own.Or, take for example Bruckner's Ninth Symphony, which Johan (one of the four main characters) was listening to very loudly in one scene. Bruckner spent the last nine years of his life composing this symphony (and actually never finishing it). Its Adagio is contended, at least by some Brucknerites, to be a farewell to life.This very last of Bergman's films feels like his own requiem. It can make us sad, that's for sure.

It's perhaps more accurate to say the characters Johan and Marianne from Scenes From a Marriage play a large part in this new drama. It wasn't what I expected, but it turned out to be a wise choice, I think. Rather than simply revisit two characters from 30 years ago and see where they are now (which would have been interesting enough), Bergman chose to include and focus on the story of Henrik (Johan's son) and Henrik's wife and daughter. The story is fascinating, disturbing, thought-provoking; classic Bergman.Though Saraband probably won't be remembered as Bergman's finest achievement, it is certainly Bergman at his finest, and, whether intentionally or not, the film definitely echoes other Bergman classics. The light coming in through the church windows in an empty church reminds of questions raised in Winter Light. The daughter wandering through the woods and into a stream reminds us of violations of The Virgin Spring. Likewise, inappropriate surrogate relationships (I'll put it that way for those who haven't seen the film) reminds us of issues raised in The Silence. And issues of love between parents (particularly fathers) and their children raised in Through a Glass Darkly and Wild Strawberries also appear here. Bergman does not provide us with answers any more than he did when he raised these questions some 40 years ago, but he can still make us think. So if Saraband is Bergman's last film, it's a very fitting exit.The documentary on the making of the film is, for me, no less emotionally moving than the film itself -- it touchs on Bergman's thoughts on making his last film, the death of his wife and his own mortality.",

That considered, I would venture that the very wise, and quietly disturbing Saraband, though admittedly not in the same league as Cries and Whispers, Persona, or The Passion of Anna, is a gift--to both the history of world cinema and those who love the monolithic artistry of Ingmar Bergman--that I would easily place alongside Autumn Sonata in stature.Visually, Saraband is gorgeous to look at, though I cannot deny missing Sven Nykvist's peerless cinematography. That the acting is superlative is no huge surprise of course. Ullman's performance is so subtle that it took a second viewing to begin to comprehend her intent. (And while I'm there: at least SIXTY cheers to a great and beautiful actress who has embraced with dignity the increasingly rare phenomena of aging naturally.) B&ouml;rje Ahlstedt is devastating, as he was in Fanny and Alexander. It's terrific Bergman gave him the opportunity to shine in a larger role here. Julia Dufvenius deserved a \"best supporting\" actress nomination and one can only hope that the multi-critic buzz that international stardom awaits her will become a reality. But I feel that it is Erland Josephson, overlooked in many of the reviews I've read, who shines the most brilliantly here. His Johan is a monster of Shakespearian proportion, oh-so-skillfully humanized without diluting the character's venom. Josephson's has always been a gargantuan talent, a voice that has not \"mellowed\" with age one iota.Saraband's unsettling and enigmatic resolution is but one of the many reasons that Bergman, reconsidered in this, his final film, remains the artistic genius he has always been--in this instance authenticated, once again, by his ability to capture, and then relate, the catharsis that life so often denies us.Oh, and concerning the special feature, The Making of Saraband.... An 80-something Bergman? Down on the floor? Placing his actors? You expected LESS, perchance?",

    "review/text": "\"Saraband\" is a deeply personal film by veteran director Ingmar Bergman, inspired by the loss of his wife Ingrid. Marianne (Liv Ullmann) is suddenly moved to visit her first ex-husband Johan (Erland Jossefsen), a retired academic whom she has not seen in at least 30 years. She finds Johan at his summer house in the country, where his estranged son Henrik (B&ouml;rje Ahlstedt) and 19-year-old granddaughter Karin (Julia Dufvenius) are staying in the nearby lake cottage. Henrik is distraught over the death of his beloved wife Anna 2 years before and has transferred his possessive affection to Karin, a talented young cellist, whom he tutors in music and fears will strike out on her own. There is no limit to the venom between Henrik and Johan, a needy man who as a boy sought his father's love and the father whose distaste for the boy eventually turned to hatred. Marianne becomes a sympathetic ear for Karin and is immersed in this family drama.\"Saraband\" is a series of conversations between these 4 people, isolated from the outside world by miles of countryside and by the strong emotions that bind them at the same time they corrode their relationships. Many of the conversations are essentially monologues, sometimes even spoken to the camera. The performances are expressed intensely, and I was particularly impressed with B&ouml;rje Ahlstedt's pathetic, cruel, mercurial characterization. But \"Saraband\" works better as a tortuous expression of Ingmar Bergman's grief than it does as a story, and the film is better understood on that level. Karin is too neurotic and melodramatic for a 19-year-old, until we remember that she embodies the psyche of the very old, very neurotic director. Johan's bizarre attachment to his deceased daughter-in-law, whom he barely knew, doesn't make sense unless we consider that Johan is Bergman, just as Henrik is Bergman. The quasi-incestuous relationship between Henrik and Karin seems out of place in the story, but it works as metaphor. The memory of Anna pervades the film to an extent that is creepy. But Anna is there because Ingrid is always in Ingmar Bergman's thoughts.One thing I found interesting in \"Saraband\" was the conflicting views of the characters: Marianne always thought Johan was \"nice\", while Henrik finds him nasty and beneath contempt. Most of the world thinks Henrik obnoxious, domineering, and slightly crazy, but his wife thought him full of love. There is a valid point there. And the fact that the characters can no more change how they feel about one another than they could bring back the dead is accepted as fact, which I suppose is kind of refreshing. But what we have is a bunch of people who don't get along. And so what? They don't need to. Bergman manages to give every emotion a great deal of weight. Too much weight. \"Saraband\" is an interesting bit of metaphor and may shed light on the nature of Berman's personal grief. But these characters just aren't credible in the real world. It doesn't work as a narrative. And I think it needs to, thus my 3-star rating.Note: Bergman should have been more careful with his numbers. Marianne is 63 and hasn't seen Johan in 30-32 years. They were married for 16 years, then saw each other again after Marianne divorced her 2nd husband. I'm sure that Bergman wanted to indicate that Marianne was a young woman when she married, but he probably didn't mean to say she was in junior high school. It's a careless error that Bergman would probably brush off as inconsequential, but numerically-minded members of the audience will pick up on it right away.The DVD (Sony Pictures 2006): The single bonus feature is a 44-minute film about \"The Making of Saraband\". It is primarily behind-the-scenes footage of Ingmar Bergman directing the actors, filming, and dealing with technical issues. It also includes some interview footage with Bergman, the cast, and the film's art director, costume designer, and prop master. Subtitles are available for the feature film in English, French (Canadian), and Portuguese (Brazilian).",

    "review/text": "We return to the couple from `Scenes From a Marriage' 30 years later. They haven't seeneach other in all that time. Marianne, still working as a lawyer, goes to visit Johan, nowliving off a rich inheritance in a house in the woods. The film examines the tremendousand sad complexity of Johan's life, and the further unsettling influence of Marianne'sreturn to the scene.While there is a surface pleasure in seeing the two together again, we realize how poisonousJohan has become, allowing his 61 year old son from an earlier marriage, and his granddaughterto live in a separate house on the estate, although he hates his son. The granddaughter is in turntrapped by a desperate, near incestuous relationship with her father. In a series of simple, honest,and very powerful scenes, we watch these characters bounce off of each other in various combinations.And while all of them are plagued by deep, perhaps unforgivable flaws, I always understood thatBergman felt for them, and wished the fragments of humanity buried inside could free them. I didn'tfeel the film was as dark as many people for this reason. Like a directing priest, Bergman hates the sin,but not the sinner, so these people, so easy to hate, or at least dismiss on paper, keep us interestedand emotionally involved, praying they will find their way out of the darkness. A strong and powerfulwan song from a great film-maker, making his last film at 85.",

    "review/text": "Ingmar Bergman returns to his origins with this superb story, of visible theatrical tinge. Sarabande resumes all an febrile existence, dedicated to explore and visit the most recondite corners of the human soul, fears, anguishes and frizzled emotions, amalgamated by the time, the far distances and the weight of the memory.The initial sequence in which we are in front of a table covered by pictures with Liv Ulman starring us reminds us the cinema is a collection of photographs in movement; a frozen lapse of time and preserved for the eyes of the future. In this sense it begins with similar approach respect \"Persona\" or Tarkovky' s \"The mirror.\"A collection of frozen images that nevertheless make to Marianne to undertake a journey of more than two hundred miles to visit to her husband Johan, after thirty years without exchange impressions of any sort.Since this visit we will aware about a serene gaze around their lives, past and present blend one each other; she is a lawyer and he is writing a book. They had two daughters; he knows nothing about them and she is aware about a distant and random contact with Sra who lives in Australia and Martha, who is serious sick, since has missed in the dark shadows of the forgetfulness and the diffused labyrinths of her memory.But their lives will turn around the talented niece of Johan, who plays the cello with her father as musical preceptor. Hindemith's Sonata for cello Op. 125 will become the entrance for her to open her heart in the verge of the desperation and the infinite loneliness she is immersed. And so, Marianne who always had kept so isolated from her daughters finds herself trapped in the web of her own memories. Johan and Marianne will make the last act of self redemption with this girl who lives sheltered by her father, an ambitious and resented human being incapable to stand up since her wife died of cancer.An intimate portrait admirably directed and magisterially narrated by this genius of the camera: Ingmar Bergman.",

    "review/text": "THE GIFT OF IGGY:His films are forever embedded into my heart and soul.Their beauty. Majesty. Depth. Vision. Courage. Humanity.Ingmar Bergman.My god, the mere act of typing his name gives my entire being goosebumps.So much has been written and said about this grand master of the cinema (by some of the world's greatest critics, and by the man himself) that my fingers tremble with apprehension and humility knowing that these very words I'm writing will now be added to that stock and stall.In my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd ever get the chance to actually review the latest Bergman film simply because, after 1985's FANNY & ALEXANDER, there was never again supposed to BE another \"latest Bergman film.\"Yet, here it is. This wonderful gift called SARABAND. It exists. It was made.And it is another Bergman masterpiece.I know...with an intro like this, the whole idea of journalistic objectivity gets thrown out the window. Well, let it fly! I simply cannot approach any critical discussion of Bergman with the slightest degree of personal removal. This man's films have literally changed the way I look at this thing we call \"life.\" If anyone were to ask me what are some of the reasons why I love being alive, I'd put the words \"The Films Of Ingmar Bergman\" at the almost tippy-top of that list.Suffice to say that that when it comes to Bergman and his oeuvre, those who know, know. Those who don't know, I just feel sorry for. So, dear reader, if you are in the former crowd...we are about to dance delightfully together. If you are of the latter, I ask that you watch the dance from the sidelines and hopefully feel the itch to participate in the near future.THE RETURN OF IGGY:For me, one of the true delights of SARABAND is the mere fact that it exists at all.I didn't know it was coming! I found out about it one day when I saw the poster while standing in the lobby of the Cinema Arts Centre, the local art movie house I often frequent in Huntington, Long Island. My goodness me...there they were...the great Erland Josephson and Liv Ullman...the quintessential Bergman performers...the stars of his SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE...standing next to each other, arm in arm, head to head, in a semi-mournful, yet also comforting embrace. Directly above their heads in large red letters...\"SARABAND\"...and below it...\"An Ingmar Bergman Film.\"WHAT??? HUH??? BE STILL MY HEART!!! HUMINA! HUMINA! HUMINA!A NEW Bergman film!!! Jesus, he's gotta be in his mid-eighties!!! Who'd a-thunk it? It was my understanding that ol' Iggy felt he'd said all he wanted to on celluloid and was devoting the rest of his remaining artistic life to the theater and books of self-reflection. (Oh...by the way...I cannot recommend highly enough Bergman's two books about his life and work, IMAGES (his films) and THE MAGIC LANTERN (his life)...they are remarkable.) I guess the ol'muse grabbed him by the gonads and called him to the cameras for one last fling.And why not? I remember with great delight the feeling of joy when, at the age of 75, Akira Kurosawa gave us the majesty that is RAN. Not to mention the fact that he made THREE more films after THAT! Does it not give us all hope when we see great works of art still being created by the masters, well into their 7th and 8th decades? It just doesn't get any more life affirming than that.After a bit of research, I learned that SARABAND was a sequel of sorts to SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, picking up the story thirty years after the divorce of the two main characters. How cool is that? My mind was all a flutter with the story possibilities such a scenario could create. Of course, what made it all the more exciting was the fact that after almost 20 years of cinematic silence, Bergman was about to let his voice be heard again...a voice that would be adding whatever he himself had learned in the 20 years he had cinematically been absent from our lives. What was Iggy bringing to the table now? What would he be teaching us about ourselves?THE STYLE OF IGGY:From the moment you hear the first Bach musical notes sublimely emanating from a Cello on the soundtrack, you know you're in Bergmanland. I couldn't believe how taken I was by this recognition...this instant sense of being in his cinematic world.It was emotionally devastating for me. \"My god, he's back. Thank you! Thank you!\"SARABAND is a story about regret, lost chances, selfishness and greed. It is told through four major characters. The film is essentially a ten-act play (no surprise from this greatest of theater directors) in which there is no more than two characters per act. Each act/vignette begins with a black screen, the sounds of a cello, and an epitaph designed to help set the emotional mood for what we are about to witness. The film essentially deals with the reunion between the characters of Marianne (Ullman) and Johan (Josephson), (who Bergman fans already know from SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, although knowledge of that film is not necessary to enjoy this one) and the relationship between Johan and his hated son Henrik (Borje Ahlstedt), as well as Henrik's obsessive relationship with his nineteen-year old daughter Karin (Julia Dufvenius). The way in which all four of these characters interlock with each other is pure Bergman. It is one of the films great delights to see these actors play off each other using what can only be described as that one of a kind, highly stylized and totally intense Bergmanesque cinema acting technique. Since the camera only has two characters to look at in each scene, we get to examine every facial tick, every pore, every breath of these superb actors as they battle with each other in a macabre dance of family dysfunction, grief and turmoil.IGGY PLOT POINTS:For reasons even she herself cannot explain, Marianne is compulsively drawn towards wanting to see her ex-husband again after thirty years. When she visits him, she not only becomes a part of Johan's life again, but the life of his granddaughter, a gifted cellist, who lives in a house on Johan's country estate with her father Henrik, Johan's son, who is both her musical teacher, mentor and tormentor. Father and son have a deep hatred for each other that is only tempered by their mutual love for Henrik's deceased wife...a woman of such beauty and love, that her absence has literally destroyed them all. It seems that she was the glue that held them all together, and since she's been gone these past two years, Henrik overcompensates for his loss by clinging to his daughter for companionship and love, while forcing her to study the cello and master it far beyond her own natural gifts. There is also more than just a hint of incest in this father/daughter relationship, and Karin is choking to death from her father's obsessive need for love, devotion and attention. He wants her to study to be a great solo cellist, while all she desires is to just be part of the orchestra, without all the pressure. Marianne can literally do nothing but listen, observe and try to offer advice and succor to all the principles involved. In the end, all these dynamics come crashing into one another, resolving themselves in a way only Ingmar Bergman could devise and pull of. It is devastating, fascinating and beyond beautiful. It hurts so good!WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT, IGGY?So, what was he finally trying to say? What drove him, after 20 years, to come back to us? Perhaps SARABAND is a message about appreciating what you have in life, and cherishing it. Maybe it's about how regret can be so soul crushing; we should do our best to avoid creating situations in life where regret may leer its ugly head. Maybe he was just trying to say that no matter how long we live, us human beings will never really have it all figured out, this thing called life...and perhaps we never will.Message or no message, what does it matter? SARABAND is our now. Ours to cherish, absorb, think about and enjoy for as long as we are deemed worthy to exist by whatever powers that be...if any. I think even Ingmar would appreciate that kind of positive thinking.",

    "review/text": "Ingmar Bergman's SARABAND could be considered a sequel to SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE. In the film Bergman returns to familiar territory. Marianne and Johan, the main characters of the earlier film, meet after thirty years. Marianne is the one who initiates the contact, through we never know why, we realize somewhat quickly that she still loves Johan deeply, or at least a part of her does. Johan is irascible as ever through most of the film. We meet Henrick, Johan's son from a previous marriage and witness a father/son relationship that is at best, hate filled and spiteful. We see the troubling relationship that Henrick has with his daughter Karin, a musically gifted young woman. We are also unsure of the tension between Henrick and Johan, assuming at first it is stemmed from abandonment issues on the part of Henrick and a failure of Henrick to live up to Johan's expectations, but as the film progresses we come to see it may be far more twisted. Marianne seems to get stuck in the middle of the arguments much to the resentment of Henrick and Johan, but she becomes indispensable for Karin.Needless to say, the film is complex, and Bergman handles the complexities by allowing them to puzzle and challenge the viewer which may be why the film is so engaging. It's also superbly acted by Bergman favorites Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson reprising their roles as Marianne and Johan from SCENES. Borge Alhstedt who plays Henrick has likewise has been cast in other Bergman films. As with so many Bergman films, meticulous attention is played to small details such as the vacation home, the country church, even the selection of music. In one scene we find Johan listening to Bruckner's Ninth in full volume, the bombast of the piece matching his personality. And of course, there's a \"Bergmanesque\" gut wrenching scream releasing more existential angst than imaginable, this time from Karin.The film is sophisticated as opposed to sentimental, and if this is Bergman's last film, it may not be as lavish as some of his other works, but it does encapsulate much of what is great about Bergman. It's certainly a film that can be seen more than once and lead to lively discussions.",

It was great to see them so changed and yet still the same--Marianne still too-good-to-be-true and Johann still a jerk. Very early in the film, however, we are faced with a large discrepancy between Scenes and this film. In Scenes, Marianne is 35 and Johann 42. In Saraband, there is now a 23 year difference in their ages. Even within Saraband, the timing just doesn't work, as other reviewers have pointed out here. At first I was just confused, but then I was angry at the director for not respecting the fans of his older work. It reminded me of when characters age inexplicably on soap operas, like when Victoria aged ten years overnight on the Young and the Restless. I guess we can put up with that from Bergman but it would have been a lot less distracting if he had just made Marianne 70 and Johann 77 or something like that. It need not have changed the story.",

    "review/text": "In 2003 Swedish film legend Ingmar Bergman made his last film ever- although he's said that before, some two decades after his prior farewell to film with Fanny And Alexander. He should have never come back after that valedictory, for his effort, Saraband, a supposed sequel to his 1973 Swedish television smash Scenes From A Marriage, is a bad film- the worst I've yet to see from Bergman, and a bad film by any measure. His other `bad' films, Cries And Whispers and The Serpent's Egg, at least had some redeeming features, as the former was overall, a good solid film, while the latter showed some potential near the end. Saraband, by contrast, is an utter void, and takes all of Bergman's worst tendencies, shoves them all together in one film, recycles the worst parts of a half dozen other of his films, and the concoction is godawful, starting with the abysmal writing. I believe Ingmar Bergman, as a screenwriter, had a strong claim to being the greatest published writer of the 20th Century. Period. But, this work is bad, really bad, not only as a screenplay and a film, but most especially as a sequel to the great Scenes From A Marriage. And it starts with the bad writing.First off, before I delve into that, however, all the major critics are wrong about this film- in their qualitative assessment as well as its ties to Scenes From A Marriage. This is in no way shape nor form a sequel to that film because the two older lead characters, Johan and Marianne (Erland Josephson and Liv Ullman), while sharing superficial qualities in common with the earlier film's qualities, are clearly not the same characters, just as one has to posit that the characters in the tv miniseries version and the shorter film version of Scenes From A Marriage are different characters because they do not go through the exact same things, and key plot elements in one are not in the other. Think of them as parallel universes with slight differences. That contemporary critics miss the obvious in their arts reviews no longer astounds me, it only saddens me. There are too many key differences, however, to be overlooked. If that is so, then the two main characters in this film are even farther removed from the Scenes From A Marriage universe. Yes, they have the same first names, are a divorced couple, and had two daughters together, split up over Johan's similarly named lover- Paula, and work in similar professions to their younger doppelgangers, but all other similarities end there.... What made Scenes From A Marriage a great film was its writing, alone, and that Bergman never condescended. He let his viewers fill in the blanks they knew of from their own lives to background the scenes he showed within. In this film Bergman does not trust his audience, and condescends relentlessly. This is the sort of film that any producer worth their salt should have nixed, for it is an embarrassment to both them and to a great artist who is manifestly past his prime. Real greatness is knowing both what art to create and how, and what art to just leave in the bad idea pile. Bergman manifestly has lost that ability to discern, and this film's greatest flaw is, indeed, that it was ever made. It showcases all of his prior worst tendencies without a dram of his former redeeming greatness. It is forced, overwrought, trite, poorly written and acted, and just plain dull. Bergman leaves no melodramatic angles unused, and all to poor effect- death, suicide, insanity, incest; even Henrik's supposed life or death weighing on his abused daughter. Bergman has, like a child, finally ripped the zit off his face that was annoying him so long, and, with the pimple off, exposed a good deal of the red pulpy flesh beneath, and it ain't pretty!As for the DVD features, there are only a few trailers, a long making of featurette that, unfortunately, is not well structured nor insightful, and the DVD is not dubbed. It only is subtitled, albeit in crisp gold lettering. Saraband is an unfortunate end to one of the greatest careers in human arts, but worst of all shows the utter bankruptcy of most contemporary arts criticism, in that the critics too often excuse what an art lacks as if it has it in full, merely because of the artist's prior works or reputation. By allowing great artists' bad work a pass it sets up a precedent, so that the critic is not singled out for having shamed themselves by `attacking' a master, that tells lesser artists that they do not have to strive either, and thus the downward cycle starts, and society ends up with reams of rotting garbage as bad art, and no one willing to pinpoint the stench. Welcome to the 21st Century world of art, and be thankful last century's Ingmar Bergman never had to deal with it, lest many of his greatest works would have never been made!",

    "review/text": "Bergman first introduced us to Johan and Marianne in his 1974 masterpiece Scenes from a Marriage, one of the cinema's most exacting dissections of our all-too-human failure to connect. Bergman and the splendid Scandanavian actors Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann took us through Johan and Marianne's marriage, divorce, and post-divorce reconciliation. In the end, they live apart, but still make room for the bond between them.Three decades later, Bergman, Josephson and Ullmann have given us Saraband, a late-life gift. Marianne decides that even though she hasn't seen Johan since the 1970s, it's time to make contact again. Johan has inherited money from an aunt, and lives in splendid isolation overlooking a lake. She literally wakes him with a kiss, but soon enough Marianne's fantasy of an idyllic reunion evaporates as she gets drawn deeper into the power struggles in Johan's family.Henrik, Johan's son, is staying in a nearby cottage with his daughter Karin. Both of them still mourn Anna, Henrik's wife and Karin's mother, who died two years before. Henrik, a music teacher, is preparing Karin, an accomplished cellist, for her conservatory entrance exams. The elderly Johan remains cold-hearted but charismatic (not unlike Bergman's own father) and one of the questions the movie explores is why people are so attracted to him. Henrik wants his father's affection and acceptance, even though Johan refuses to give it, ostensibly due to some slight by Henrik when he was 19 years old. In a painful scene, Henrik goes to Johan to ask for money to help Karin, and in his 61 year old face, we see the bewilderment of the boy who never came to grips with his self-absorbed father.For Karin, her grandfather is a counterweight to the suffocating embrace of her father. Karin struggles to figure out what she owes Henrik, what she owes to the memory of her mother, and what she owes to herself. She lets Marianne see some, but not all, of the turmoil she's going through. For Marianne, her attraction to Johan remains as difficult to pin down as it was when she was married to him. She's always wanted something from him, but since she can't define what it is, she'll probably never get it.The struggles between the characters get played out over ten riveting scenes bookended by Marianne's opening and closing monologues. Karin makes her choices. Henrik reacts. Marianne throws herself once more against Johan's emotional aloofness. As he's done throughout his brilliant career, Bergman brings it alive through artful dialog, perfect dramatic timing, and riveting cinematic composition. The characters are not always likable, but they are never less than engrossing.The Criterion's DVD includes a mini-documentary of Bergman making Saraband. We watch the 87 year old director slump to the floor to illustrate some blocking, kid around with the crew, poke and prod his actors into position. It's a treat to watch him work. One wonders if any other director will ever elicit such an emotionally powerful performance from Julia Dufvenius, the fine young actress who plays Karin. One also wonders why Bergman put himself through the grueling labor of making another film after he'd announced he was through.Bergman spent his entire career obsessed by the difficulties of human connection. Apparently he wants to say one last thing about it, which seems to be this: after all the tears and shouting, all the posturing and cruelty, all the reaching out and pulling back, this is what remains: marriages of true minds (the photo of Anna used in the film is a picture of Bergman's great love, his deceased wife Ingrid); the fraught ties of fathers and sons; memories of old loves; what you give and get from children; and the devolution of the flesh. None of it is easy, the master tells us, but all of it is necessary. In the end, it's all you have.What's truly sad is that Bergman, sixty years after embarking on his cinematic journey, claims that he's done. He did for film what Shakespeare did for theater, took it to new levels by expanding the language used to describe the glories and follies of human striving. He will certainly be missed and he can't be replaced.But don't see Saraband for nostalgic reasons. It's a moving, insightful film that deserves a place in the director's canon. Saraband stands on its own, but it's a deeper experience if you watch Scenes from a Marriage first.",

    "review/text": "\"Saraband\" is the name of a movement in a classical piece of music by Bach. It is also the name of a dance and just like a piece of music Ingmar Bergman weaves his story to a certain rhythm of emotions.\"Saraband\" touched me on a deeply personal level. It is the greatest movie going experience of my life. Now I know what many of you are thinking. How dare you! What about the \"Lord of the Ring\" movies, the \"Harry Potter\" series, the \"Star Wars\" movies and of course \"Titanic\". How on earth could I possible justify my reaction to dare say a much smaller film, a film that will go unseen by millions, yet alone, a Swedish film, is the greatest movie going experience of my life. Well you see I never really got caught up in the \"Lord of the Ring\" movies. I enjoyed them but I never read the books, nor have I ever read the \"Harry Potter\" books and I don't intend to ever read them, I simply don't have any interest. But what makes \"Saraband\", for me, the ultimate experience is the fact it was the first film I ever saw by Ingmar Bergman in a theatre. It was such an experience to be able to go out and watch a movie by my favorite director on the big screen. That is my explanation.Bergman originally released this film two years ago on Swedish television just as he did \"Fanny and Alexander\" back in 1983. \"Saraband\" though is quite a cinematic event for film lovers. It is the first film Bergman has directed since 1984's \"After the Rehearsal\" to be released in theatres. Is that not cause for a celebration or what?The film is a sequel to Bergman's 1974 masterpiece \"Scenes From A Marriage\". It is divided into 10 chapters and tells the story of Marianna (Liv Ullman) meeting Johan (Erland Josephson) 30 years after \"Marriage\". It is explained that Marianna simply had a sudden urge to visit him. Could it be as she grows older she wonders about what her life could have been like? Maybe. So the two meet as it turns out to be one of the most joyous moments in the film.At this point it should be pointed out one doesn't have to watch \"Scenes From A Marriage\" to appreciate or understand this movie. But I must admit it does help. If only because to watch these characters on-screen is like visiting old friends. When we first see them meet our minds flood with images. We recall the first film and the impression it left on us. If you haven't seen that movie \"Saraband\" may have a harder time putting you under its spell.As the film goes on we find out Johan's son, Henrik (Borje Ahlstedt) and his daughter Karin (Julia Dufvenius) are staying in his guest house. We also find out Johan and Henrik are not really on the best of terms. At most it is polite conversation whenever they are in the same room. Which is something they both try to avoid happening.Henrik plays cello and has been teaching his daughter, who has a great gift for the instrument we are told. But their relationship is a strange one. After Karin's mother died two years ago she feels she can not leave her father to go and study because it would shatter him. It is feared he might kill himself. But Henrik is not letting his daughter live her own life. The two get into an agrument which turns violent and suddenly I was thinking about the best friends and their marriage in \"Scenes\".\"Saraband\" begins to tell the story of love, the past, and reconciliation between former husband and wife, father and daughter and father and son.I wrote a review a long time ago for \"Scenes From A Marriage\" in it I said the movie has an intensity that few films have matched. Bergman just seems to throw these characters in our face as we watch them explode. I also felt it was the greatest film I had seen on the subject of love and marriage. \"Saraband\" is the only film that comes closet to matching that film's power.I should though mention, in order to be fair and balanced, that \"Saraband\" is not a better film than \"Marriage\" I seriously doubt many fans will think it is either. That is not to say \"Saraband\" is not a good film. Or a nice companion piece to \"Scenes\". Or a film without beautiful dialogue, strong performances, and powerful directing. It is a touching absorbing film but it just didn't seem to hit me as hard as \"Scenes\" did.Some of my favorite scenes in the film include a conversation between Henrik and Karin about an agrument Henrik and his wife had. Another powerful scene deals with Johan and Henrik. Here we can see what kind of relationship this father and son have. We can actually fill the hate and disgust between them. And finally a scene with Marianna and Karin, as Marianna describes Johan to Karin is quite moving. In fact all of the moments in this film are wonderfully expressed by this cast and Bergman's ear for dialogue.Are their faults with the film? Yes. The relationship between Henrik and Karin seems very strange and deserved an explanation but is given none. Also information about Karin's future is never given and we are left with that same murkiness with Johan's future. Though all in all \"Saraband\" is a masterpiece that is dominated by strong performances. It's emotions are real and we believe what we are seeing. I can not recommend this film strongly enough.Bottom-line: The greatest movie going experience of my life. Ingmar Bergman's sequel to \"Scenes From A Marriage\" may not be as powerful as that movie, but so few films are. \"Saraband\" though exceeds as its own film. It feels complete as is. It has powerful acting, strong directing, and some truly beautiful speeches all set to a wonderful score by Bach.",

    "review/text": "***1/2Legendary Swedish director Ingmar Bergman officially \"retired\" from filmmaking in 1982 following the release of his highly acclaimed autobiographical drama, \"Fanny and Alexander.\" That was supposed to have been his swan song, yet, since that time, he has made so many TV movies that have been released into theaters in the United States that, for Americans at least, it has pretty much been a \"retirement\" in name only.His latest such film to be released here, \"Saraband,\" is, technically, a sequel to his earlier masterwork, \"Scenes From a Marriage,\" which was also a made-for-TV work that received theatrical distribution in the United States in 1974. \"Saraband\" reunites us with the now-divorced couple, Marianne and Johan, whom we are told have not really spoken to each other for almost thirty years. For reasons that she is not even able to fully explain to herself, Marianne (Liv Ullman) feels compelled to visit her ex-husband (Erland Josephson) and find out how he's doing and, perhaps, figure out if there still might be something between them. However, despite the fact that this new film is billed as an extension of the original \"Marriage,\" Johan and Marianne wind up somewhat on the periphery of the real story which involves the incestuous relationship between Henrik (Borie Ahlstedt), Johan's son from a previous marriage, and his beautiful 19-year old daughter, Karin (Julia Dufvenius). Henrik is a classical musician whose beloved wife, Anna, has recently died. In some strange way, he clings to Karin almost as a replacement for Anna - even though there are hints that the incest began before Anna's death and that indeed Anna was aware of it - making it clear to his daughter that he would be utterly destitute if she were ever to leave.This is obviously heady stuff for the viewer, but Bergman is, as always, so in control of his material that we are drawn into the conflict even though, initially, we may be repelled by what is taking place. In addition to the struggle between father and daughter, there is also the intense hatred between Johan and Henrik - so intense, in fact, that Henrik even admits he would take great pleasure in seeing his father stricken with a horrible illness that would cause him a slow and agonizing death. Caught in the middle of all this, as both observer and confidante, is Marianne, who can proffer only so much help and advice before she, too, risks becoming infected by the emotional disease that holds these people in its grip. Yet, of all the characters, Marianne appears to be the most stable and hopeful in her dealings with life. For instance, she can see the ugliness of much of Johan's way of interacting with people, yet she can still find a core of something worth loving buried deep inside the man.Even for a Bergman chamber drama with just four people in its cast, \"Saraband\" is a remarkably stark piece of cinema and, as such, it may be off-putting to those unfamiliar with the director's work. The camera rarely moves outdoors, preferring instead to remain intensely focused on the characters who pour out at great length their darkest, deepest thoughts for us to muse over and examine. His is a complex tale of people quietly torn asunder by unhealthy obsessions, morbid self-interest and an inability to reach out in love and forgiveness even in the darkest moments of one's life. And as always with Bergman, the four performers transcend mere acting and literally become the characters on screen.The decades certainly haven't mellowed Bergman's mood when it comes to the contemplation of death or the meaninglessness of existence, so make sure you're in the right frame of mind before taking on this film. But those who are true devotees of Bergman's work will certainly not want to miss \"Saraband.\"",

    "review/text": "The most harrowing aspect of senility is perhaps loneliness and a sense of impotence, two sentiments that resonate throughout Ingmar Bergman's latest film \"Saraband\".While sorting out old photos and reminiscing about her life, Marianne (Liv Ullman) felt the sudden urge to reconnect with her ex-husband Johan (Erland Josephson) whom she hadn't spoken in thirty years. Soon after arriving at Johan's cottage in a remote countryside, Marianne found herself in the middle of a bitter struggle between Johan and his son, Henrik (B&ouml;rje Ahlstedt), a former conductor, over the future of Henrik's daughter, Karin (Julia Dufvenius), a budding cellist.Henrik has been devastated by the recent passing of his late wife, Anna, and his desperate attempt to keep the last remaining love of his life, Karin, on his side not only irritated Johan but also tormented Karin, who was well aware her father's true intention of giving her cello lessons. A surprise finding by Karin would eventually culminate in the climax of the film, a candid portrayal of how far people would go to try to hang on.In our own way, we all want to know that we matter and that our existence has amounted to something meaningful. This desire is often driven and intensified by the awareness of our mortality. Marianne and Johan were also forced to face up to theirs in the film where in one scene Johan awoke Marianne during the wee hour of the night and confided to her that he felt \"an anxiety that's greater than me\" and that he couldn't stand to bear it. It was the night where they first slept in the same bed ever since they were separated.Johan has never looked so at ease lying there besides Marianne.",

    "review/text": "\"Saraband\" is an intense movie. It should be watched sitting very still, so that everything makes itself known to you. To me, the film is essentially about parents and children--mostly about fathers and sons, but also about mothers and daughters, as the viewer will see briefly at the end of the film. It seems to say: there are two ways of having a relationship with your children: you can abandon them, spurn their love, and watch your soul wither in the process; or you might smother them with your own issues and grief and love--that too can lead to disaster and maybe violence. However, by implication there is a third way, though you won't find it in this film. That way would be somewhere between these two, a way that doesn't involve the nauseating narcissism that Johan and Marianne showed from time to time in \"Scenes from a Marriage\" when, for instance, an abortion is procured for no better reason than the pregnancy seems inconvenient at the time (this is in the longer version of that film). These people clearly need to learn to live beyond themselves, and that's why the figure of Anna, hovering over the film like the Holy Ghost, is so important. Clearly she knew the right way.The one flaw I see in this film is the way the men and women are set up, a way that seems to me stereotypical: the men are sullen, withdrawn, melancholic and prone to violence. The women are strong, prone to nurturing and caring. While these tendencies are clearly part of reality, they make the film, for me at least, less than it could be. Still, \"Saraband\" proves that some of Bergman's best work has been that of his \"retirement\". I hope I'm this productive and wise in my eighties.",

    "review/text": "\"Saraband\" reintroduces Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson as Marianne and Johan - the characters they played in Ingmar Bergman's classic 1973 release \"Scenes from a Marriage.\" If you've not seen that, no matter. Ullman's Marianne sets the scene for you at the opening of the film and tells you everything you need to know in a five-minute prologue. The movie then consists of 10 intense dialogues between each of the four main characters. [It's not as staged as it sounds.] Then, there's a headscratching, out-of-the-clear-blue epilogue that I'm sure has some great, deep meaning, but was lost on me.One thing that bothered me is that the math (or the translation?) in the movie doesn't work. Marianne and Johan work out that they've not seen each other in 32 years. Subsequently, Marianne tells Johan she is now 62, meaning they last saw each other when she was 30. Marianne later tells Johan's granddaughter (through a previous marriage) that she was married to Johan for 16 years, then they broke up, then got together again briefly before splitting for good. That puts Marianne at...under 14 when they married. Bergman seems to have lost the plot there a bit.I have to admit that how I felt about 'Saraband' was deeply influenced after my viewing when I read the following blurb on IMDB: \"The film is very autobiographical. The character of Anna (and the picture of her) is actually Ingrid Von Rosen, Ingmar Bergman's wife, who died of cancer, and was his greatest love.\"The camera lingers and lingers and...lingers at von Rosen's beguiling photo. It's almost hypnotic and - at the same time - a bit spooky, like you're staring at a ghost that inhabits the entire movie. Indeed, three of the four characters are obsessed with Anna and - two years on - can't come to grips with her passing. With this knowledge, you'll see the movie in a different light and understand the deeply personal nature of it.Also worth noting: Julia Dufvenius - who plays gifted yound cellist Karin - is going to be a huge star.

    "review/text": "For many years the films of Ingmar Bergman have haunted us, films that dare to enter territories untouched by others, peopled by actors of consummate skill, extended monologues both spoken and silent, and secret doors into the souls of some of the most fascinating characters created for the screen. SARABAND is no exception: this theme and variations is written and performed and directed to perfection. It leaves the viewer speechless.Marianne (Liv Ullmann) is a successful lawyer in her 60s who returns to her ex-husband's solitary retreat just for a visit. Her ex-husband Johan (Erland Josephson), since remarried and redivorced, has a son Henrik (B&ouml;rje Ahlstedt) by another wife who lives nearby on the lake: Henrik is a musician and writer and lives with his daughter Karin (Julia Dufvenius), teaching her cello in preparation for an audition at the music conservatory. What Marianne finds after thirty years absence is that Johan and Henrik are on bitter terms, that Karin is frustrated with her demanding teacher/father, and that the recurring 'saraband' movement of this story is the mutual adoration and mourning of Anna, Karin's mother and Henrik's deceased wife. Marianne and Johan muse over their past lives, discovering that despite circumstances they still love each other. Marianne is able to open the hearts of Karin, Johan, and Henrik and provide a tender voice that brings a degree of resolution to a family broken.As with all of Bergman's films it is not the story content as the method in telling that makes his films so indelibly and quietly passionate. Everything is understated: solo sequences are played with Bach's solo cello suites, and when two or more characters interact the music becomes Brahms and Bruckner. This is an elegant pastoral about looking into the mirror of our souls in old age and finding both the beauties and the missed opportunities of a life now passing toward the end. Each of the four actors is splendid, though watching Liv Ullmann in her native tongue is a renaissance of memory of all the fine work this extraordinary actress has done. Bergman gives us an elegy not a eulogy and one can only hope for more. Highly recommended on every level. In Swedish with English subtitles. Grady Harp, February 06",

    "review/text": "Saraband, Bergman's last film, is about a family destroyed with hostility, obsession, attempted suicide, pain, hatred and music. As a follow-up to the successful Scenes from A Marriage, 30 years ago. Marianne, a lawyer, visits her wealthy through an inheritance, ex-husband Johan, 86, who lives in the forest near the lake. During the marriage, he was unfaithful. Living nearby is Johan's 60ish son Henrik, who heads an orchestra and his 19-year old daughter, a celloist, Karin, who is taught by her father. Johan and Henrik despise each other.Henrik's wife died two years ago and he is miserable. He has an unhealthy obsession, in other words, an incestual relationship with his daughter. Bergman clearly leaves that impression as they sleep in the same bed. Karin is the recipient of his pain.Marianne encounters the sadness of Karin, they share talks openly, and Marianne learns the hostility of Henrik of his father. Through a letter Karin discovered, she learns about Anna, the wife who died.A memorable quote:Henrik speaking to Marianne of his father: \"I hate him in every dimension of the word. I hate him so much I'd happily watch him die of some horrible disease. I'd visit him daily and take note of his torment down to the last breath.\"The movie is set in chapters, uniquely played out. Most scenes call for two persons and no one else enters, it becomes a closed set without intrusions. The sets were manufactured with great detail. And Bergman favors the close-up shots. The film is lengthy, quiet, and absorbing.A special treat is to view the master at work in The Making of Saraband, and moreso, you will see readings by the actors. This treat offers great insight into Bergman's work. Enjoy! Rizzo",

When he asked why she came, she answered that she thought he had called for her. The story of Marianne and Johan in this film provides a background for another story which involved Johan's son from his first marriage, 61 year old musician Henric and his 19 year old daughter Karin whom Henric has been giving cello lessons and dreams of her becoming a famous performer. There is one more character present in the movie, even though she's been dead for two years - Anna, late Henric's wife and Karin's mother who has been deeply missed and mourned by everyone including Johan.This film is dedicated to Ingrid von Rosen, Bergman's last wife who died in 1995. It is her face we see at the photograph of Anna which Bergman shows over and over again. It seems to me that one of the reasons of making \"Saraband\" was for Bergman the chance to say to Ingrid, \"I love you and I miss you and even death can't take you from me\". In his last movie, Bergman sadly proves (once again) that even time can't heal the painful wounds caused by deeply-rooted hatred which is only one step away from love. How disturbing was the scene between 86 -year-old father and 61-year-old son. They looked the same age, old, grey-haired men who still cherish the hatred and contempt for each other that go way back and there is no victory in this power struggle. But there is hope in the movie for young Karin who breaks out of the world that she was forced to believe she belonged to but she did not and she found the strength to leave and to be free and to make her own decisions...As all Bergman's films, \"Saraband\" does not provide the easy answers to the difficult questions; it does not provide any answers at all but as old Johan in the most moving scene of the film bares his body, Bergman bares his very soul and lets us look inside of it and maybe learn something about ourselves.4.5/5",

I don't know if the men are necessarily ciphers in this film, but they certainly have issues. Saraband, of course, is the sequel to Scenes from a Marriage. I didn't like the character of Johann then, and I like him even less now; he is a selfish, sadistic man who uses everyone and feels endlessly sorry for himself. The other male character in the film is his elderly son, Henrik. Johan has always been a bad father to Henrik and now, as a result, Henrik has turned into a monster. The two of them live nearby so they can torture each other as Henrik grieves for his wife.Henrik lives in a cottage with his eighteen-year-old daughter, Karin. In fact, the two of them sleep in the same bed. They have a quasi-incestuous relationship - if not an actually incestuous one.The movie is composed of ten chapters, plus a prologue and an epilogue. We take up with Marianne (Liv Ullman) as she is going over a table of pictures. Speaking directly to the camera, she reflects on her life and her thoughts turn towards her ex-husband, whom she hasn't seen in thirty years. She decides to pay him a visit. As with many Bergman films, Saraband is a ghost story without a ghost. Marianne arrives to a haunted house - doors open and close by themselves. But it is not the house - it is the characters who are haunted.Bergman claims that this is his last work on film. Thank goodness he had another great film left in him. It is a shame however, that his mind seems made up. There is a \"making-of\" documentary on the disc in which the old master looks pretty spry.",

Trotsky's first wife was called Alexandra and was 10 years older than him. So when our teenager meets a 27-year-old woman called Alexandra, he pursues her with enormous energy. He infuriates his father so much that he's pulled out of his expensive private school and sent to a west Montreal high school, where he angers the strict new headmaster by insisting the students be allowed to create a union. The film cracks along and there is a regular supply of laughs -- forget those who say you need an understanding of the Russian Revolution to really appreciate what's happening. The climax of the film, where the young Trotsky learns whether his attempts to unionise the school, descends into something of a cliche. That said, the director recovers his touch and \"The Trotsky\" ends on a delightful tone. This is one of the best films I've seen this year.",

A deliciously dark comedy about a Canadian youth who imagines he's the reincarnation of Russian revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky, this film begins as a strong satire of idealism gone awry. The running joke, throughout, is that our hero has very little to rebel against--he's just in love with the idea that he is a relevant trailblazer. But, in fact, he's no trailblazer at all. He's just trying to mirror his life according to the facts of Trotsky's existence--right down to his love life. It's a sly and smart skewering of politics and teen rebellion. The fact that his activism has very little real world context is quite amusing as there is no obvious cause to be fought. But just as the picture had won me over--a subtle shift starts occurring and we're meant to take this arbitrary and absolutely meaningless struggle seriously. A completely implausible, and somewhat creepy, romantic entanglement doesn't help. Once I felt like the movie was asking me to embrace the student as a hero, my good will went south pretty quickly as the movie didn't seem to be in on its own joke anymore.Jay Baruchel capably plays our wannabe revolutionary. The film begins as he organizes a hysterically inept hunger strike at his father's factory. The early family scenes work equally well as Baruchel verbally spars with his father (a great Saul Rubinek). The twist of seeing this privileged youth fighting for the teeming masses elicits many laugh out loud moments as he is seemingly disconnected from the hypocrisy of his lifestyle. His father takes a page from the real Trotsky and forces his son to attend (gasp!) public school. However, this being Canada--the school is quite lovely. For no discernible reason (slight dress code infractions are the only real issues apparent), a campaign to start an actual union to represent students is initiated. Still quite funny, the film has our hero rallying the troops for the most spectacularly inane rebellion. Soon, however, the film starts to take things a bit far and the student's apathy may turn to support. Why? Because school isn't fun. That ends up being the unifying force. Deep, huh?Amidst the increasing nonsense, Baruchel stalks a 27 year old graduate student. Let's just say this really didn't add to my good will because you can imagine where this storyline is headed. And it's not a good place! Baruchel never comes to terms with the fact he's been an ungrateful tool to his father, but let's not dwell on the negative. Baruchel starts off as a awkwardly out-of-place antihero, but by the end--I found him insufferably self-involved AND we're meant to admire him for it! This satire started at a rollicking four stars for its first hour and ended at two stars for its shift of tone. A true disappointment. I guess I'll split the difference. It's a shame--I'd recommend the first hour to anyone, but I ended up hating it! KGHarris, 3/11.",

    "review/text": "This is one of my favourite films of the past decade. Good work by writer/director Jacob Tierney. I'd originally thought of rating it 4.5 stars, but am bumping it up on the strength of the DVD extras. It's brainy enough that a neo-marxist reading list wouldn't be out of place here (perhaps for the director's cut?), but there are also some funny bits of physical comedy -- and Baruchel succeeds in making the precocious teenaged activist Leon Bronstein likable and very human. You don't have to be a history buff or a Canadian to enjoy this ... though there are a few hilarious in-jokes (references to Levesque, Parizeau, and the city of London Ontario) that had even west coast audiences laughing out loud. There are some superb supporting performances here from longtime veterans like Bujold, Feore, Rubinek, and Murphy, as well as younger actors like Mabe, Horn, Pirie, and Camacho. Even Ben Mulroney makes an appearance.Alongside the comedy and romantic moments, the film raises some interesting questions about commitment to social change -- will Leon's idealism inspire his society, or will he become complacent or disillusioned like some of the older 60s generation he encounters? This film is really more about the soft-left perspective than about the darker side of political revolutions in the 20th century, which have already been examined by other artists like George Orwell. On the micro-scale of a high school student council, though, it works fine -- and it's also a thoughtful examination of what it actually does take to overcome apathy. A couple of years after this film's release, Montreal was filled with students in the \"Maple Spring\", one of the country's biggest protest movements. I have no idea whether the film played a role in this, but I'm certain that tens of thousands of young people went through the same struggles as Tony, Caroline, Sarah, and Skip, when they decided to pick up a banner and hit the streets -- and that's true whether they're in Cairo, Athens, or Washington DC.",

    "review/text": "This film documents a utopian vision of the future that was a beacon of hope to Depression weary America. You have to love something that reminds you constantly, \"This is the world of 1960!\" Orchard trees under individual glass domes, tremendous highway systems with cars going 100 miles per hour and spaced by radio control. This was a future that might have come true to some degree had a World War not turned things upside down. As much at fault as the war, however, was the unwillingness of a nation to level existing infrastructure to remap, rethink, redo entire cities from scratch. Also there were the two game changers of an emerging Soviet threat and the power of the atomic bomb. A form of highway system WAS built and it DID increase traffic flow. Indeed, it satisfied the prognostication that living in small towns one could still savor the advantages of the big cities. However they were not radio controlled and not contoured. They had to sadly do double duty as emergency air landing strips and had to be primitive fail-safe technology to keep strategic strikes from turning the highways into parking lots.For anyone who ever grew up looking with longing at the doughnut-shaped space stations of Chesley Bonestell's paintings or dreamed of flying cars for the masses, hoped to retire to the Lunar Colony Alpha or jet along in a transport tube, this is the future that came just before, a future driven not by the atom or the space race but rather the extension of electricity and safe, effective transportation to the masses. Before Disney reminded us \"It's a Small World After All\", we had \"To New Horizons\" telling us that geography no longer limited the ambitions of mankind. In some ways, perhaps, we are marching ever forward into those new horizons, and perhaps that's the way it should be.",

More so if you were a part of the NYC. club scene at this time or had aspired to been., 23 May 2006Author: suparok69 from United StatesThough the movie starts off at a some what slow-pace, it quickly snowballs into an in-dept look at the New York club scene and it's (behind the scenes) \"club wars\" & dramas. Knowing the films' two focal points (DJ Junior Vasquez & DJ Danny Tenaglia) personally, I can honestly say that this is no act. This is the kind of stuff that really transpires.. Small-level DJ's that start off as friends, say.., shopping for records together.. Notariety and fame comes into play for each (DJ) in question, and it equals nothing but competition and battles for the top-spot. Hence-forth.., some serious mud-slinging, fighting words. Would these two \"artists\" actually come to blows, meeting up face to face at the neighborhood bodega ?.. I doubt it. But it makes for good fodder for stationary drug-doing club-utants & die-hard fans of the pairs (or one) of the DJ's in question.. Point-blank.., it's entertaining, show business. Sort of like a Tupaq-Biggie thing, only more sub-cultured. The club patrons are colorful enough or as colorful as possible, in this type of venue; film. The jumping of one character/ storyline to another could be perceived as confusing if you don't pay close attention, or if you're really not interested in the New York club scene or its' inhabitants. Overall, I would say the film is mildly entertaining. Open minded movie-goers would definitely get more out of a film like \"Paris Is Burning\", which features people from the same scene.., about fifteen years earlier. My only complaint with this film, as writer/performer of the song (\"IF MADONNA CALLZ..\" by junior vasquez feat. FRANKLIN FUENTES) that this whole movie winds up being about and boils down to, is that I was never mentioned.. As a matter of fact, I think that it would be fare to say that I was erased out of this story all together. This in no way affects my feelings or review of this film. Oh well, it's like the song says, \"If Madonna Callz, I'm Not HERE..!\" I'm really.., NOT HERE !! PS. At the present time, I'm feverishly looking for a copy of this movie in any format. If anyone know's where (or how) I may acquire a copy of this movie, please contact me at suparok69@yahoo.com",

I'd like to see him do one about Camerone, in Mexico, 1863, which was one of the battles that &quot;made&quot; the French Foreign Legion.

Van Damme didn't overact and he actually suited the role. His supporting cast also did a nice job. The locations were quite inspiring. The script was very cliche in parts, but was acceptable.

    "review/text": "I grew up watching &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (which is a film which deserves to be on DVD)and all other films about the French Foreign Legion fall or rise to that film's greatness. That being so, &quot;Legionnaire&quot; stands as a solid drama of the men who join the legion to forget their past lives and to rebuild new ones--if they survive. The film is well-crafted and the wide-screen format is perfect in bringing the viewer the feel of the desert--its vastness, its heat, and its beauty. The film's action scenes are sensational and the final battles are both memorable and brutal. Jean-Claude Van Damme proves he is more than just a good body or fighting machine--he does some fine acting in this film. One wishes that it could be seen on the large screen--it deserves it.",

    "review/summary": "Different from Van Damme's other action movies",
    "review/text": "Legionnaire is a flashback to the old Foreign Legion films starring Gary Cooper like Beau Geste or Gunga Din. The movie tells the story of a boxer who betrays a French mob boss when he goes back on a deal. He is then forced to join the Foreign Legion when he has nowhere else to turn too. The film follows the training of the new company and then there battles against the Rif tribesmen. This film is very different from most of Jean-Claude Van Damme movies, but it is very good. He doesn't fight throughout the movie instead actually talking although there are plenty of action scenes.Surprisingly, Van Damme is very good as Alain DuChamps, the boxer forced into the Legion. He is very believable in the role. The supporting cast for this movie stands out as above average compared to other Van Damme action movies. Nicholas Farrell is excellent as Macentosh, the ex-soldier with a weakness for gambling. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Alain's friend, Luther, a man fed up with his past and how he's been treated. He is excellent in the supporting role to Van Damme and Farrell. Also starring are Steven Berkoff and Jim Carter. This is an excellent movie with grand landscapes in the African landscape, well put together action scenes, and believable characters. This movie deserved better than its straight to video release. The DVD offers widescreen presentation, a theatrical trailer and teaser, rare photographs of the Foreign Legion in action, and several behind the scenes documentaries and interviews with the cast and crew. There is plenty here for Van Damme fans and also action fans. Check this movie out!",

    "review/summary": "Actually, it's not that bad",
    "review/text": "I think the television listing description I read on this movie was misleading - actually no, it was wrong. According to what my TiVo said the story followed a 1920s playboy who returns from a stint in the Foreign Legion to reclaim his former lover (a mobster's girl). Obviously the person who wrote this has never seen this movie. For starters he wasn't so much a playboy as he was a boxer and for second he never returns to France to reclaim his former lover. In fact we learn through the progress of the film that the woman in question has emigrated to the United States.Okay, enough gripes about how inaccurate tv listings can be - what did I think about the movie in question. It's actually okay as far as Jean Claude VanDamme movies go, except he really doesn't do much in the way of martial arts as he has in previous films. Instead he relies more on a rifle to shoot charging North African tribesmen or fists to straighten out fellow Foreign Legionnaire's who get their kicks out of bullying their weaker colleagues.Jean Claude plays a boxer who, after reneging on a promise to throw a fight, escapes into the French Foreign Legion to flee the clutches of a murderous mobster. There he is flung headfirst into the North Africa war between the local nomadic tribesmen and the occupying French forces.What was really a treat was the presence of Steven Berkoff. It's been awhile since I have seen him in a movie. He was a very high profile in the early to mid 1980s in movies such as `Beverly Hills Cop,' `Octopussy' and `Rambo: First Blood Part II' but then seemed to disappear from view. Here he plays the Foreign Legion commander who must lick the raw recruits into shape - and he dominates every scene in which he appears.The action scenes are also well staged and you feel the danger in which the troops are thrust into, the movie makers also do a good job of conveying the confusion and chaos that comes from close quarters fighting.If you enjoyed other Jean Claude movies then chances are this one will also hit the spot. It's not quite as good as `Sudden Death' (my favorite Jean Claude picture) but it's an entertaining ride.",

    "review/text": "Definitely a good movie, Legionnaire, brings to the screen the story of a French boxer, who refuses to take part in a rigged match resulting in his joining the Foreign Legion.It is the 1920's. France's North African colonies are experiencing Arab national revolutions and the French Foreign Legion is looking for new recruits in Europe as they sense their hold is weakening.The movie is action packed, the special effects are great, the acting is excellent and the cast are wonderful.Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Berkoff, Nicholas Farrell, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Consequently, they have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.There is a wonderful feel of History; the clash between the French and Arabs is as fascinating as the interaction between the different nationalities found within the Legion, and both are presented very well in the film.History, Battles, Intrigue, Duty, and Honor are all about.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the costumes, and the music are all wonderful!The film combines romance, drama, action and adventure making it a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!",

But Legionnaire redeems his oeuvre by ignoring him throughout much of the film, giving the best lines and most of the drama to a group of relatively unknown but excellent character actors. The editing is flawless, and let's face it; no director ever went broke by ripping off Lawrence of Arabia. I love Van Damme films, and I'm telling everybody to rent it because it's not a true Van Damme picture.",

    "review/text": "The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)1. Who is he? A 1920s French boxer named Alain Lefevre, a womanizing champion boxer who refuses to take a dive, and has his eyes/history for a mobster's girlfriend2. Which family member/friend must be avenged? A long-time friend and boxing promoter gets 86'd after a crooked fight.3. Does he take his shirt off? And pants in an all male shower, in a rare bare-butt scene for JCVD4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? No, but there is that shower...5. Is there a tournament? No tournament at all, this is a different movie for Van Damme6. Is training needed for this tournament? Aaaarmy training sir!7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? No splits are necessary when you have a rifle8. Does he punch someone in the balls? Sadly, JCVD is breaking all of his movie rules in this one.9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? Unbelievably, he doesn't kick at all. I guess being a boxer makes kicking forbidden.10. Is his enemy unbeatable? A bunch of Berber warriors on horses are hardly worthy of JCVD's awe-inspiring will to win.11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? Throughout this movie there is more than one person who poses a roadblock for JCVD. The love of his life is lost to him early on. While in the French Foreign Legion he has to team up with a squirrelly Frenchman named Rosetti who can't march more than a day without falling out, a surly black American who breaks every rule, and a posh Brit with a drinking problem who was dishonorably discharged from the British military.12. Does he win? This might be the first movie since No Retreat No Surrender in which JCVD is not the unequivocal winner and hero of the movie.Straying quite a bit from his norm, Van Damme takes on a role and a script that strays from most of his standard practices. Very little fighting immediately makes it foreign territory for him, but the fact that this plays out like a Lawrence of Arabia (maybe even Beau Geste) than Lionheart - another movie in which he plays a character on the run who joins the French Foreign Legion and gets stationed in northern Africa.Production values and cinematography in this film truly reflect the 35 million dollar budget. Stunning desert landscapes and multiple juxtapositions of the sun create foreboding dimensions which visually explain Lefevre's hopeless and weathered outlook on life. Other aspects of the time period are perfect, with the music and costumes providing authenticity. Even the supporting cast is superb, most notably Steven Berkoff as hard-nosed Sgt. Steinkampf.Essentially this is about men running away from lives, seeking new future, finding camaraderie and danger in the French Foreign Legion, and fighting until the last breath for survival. This movie is extremely underrated, and I highly recommend it.",

I like this movie.All of the stock-characters and stereotypes are here, and the plot is as old as . . . well . . . as old as movies about the Legion!Van Damme is, of course, the recruit seeking escape in the Legion from enemies on civvy-street. It is that preliminary background that rather drags (&quot;Yes, yes, he's on the run . . . get on with it!&quot;). The training stage in Africa is not particularly well done, either. But once the &quot;bleus&quot; get marching to that far-away, isolated fort-- and the Rifs-- the action picks up.A number of reviewers do not like this film because it is not a martial arts film. That's their prerogative. But this was not billed as a &quot;Van Damme martial arts film,&quot; so I think their criticism unfair.Van Damme actually does some acting, here, and he is more at home in a besieged fort or boxing ring than in a night-club or romancing the &quot;female interest&quot; character. It's not high-art, but it's entertaining, so pass the wine ration and quit your grumbling!",

    "review/text": "I think this is direct to TV, I certainly never heard of it in the theaters.Jean Claude Van Damme stars as a boxer who is supposed to throw a fight. When he meets his old girlfriend who he stiffed at their wedding he decides to run away with her. This doesn't work out and he decides to run away to join the French Foreign Legion. He knows that it is going to be bad going in but has to do it. I wish they would have explained a little more of exactly why he joined but that is really the only major flaw in the movie. The interaction between the main charcters who Jean Claude meets is the shining point in the movie. Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje's(Oz, Lost) southern accent was odd to hear. It didn't fully work for me but it is always great to see him on screen. Everybody is great and they stick by each other no matter what and everybody just does a brilliant acting job overall. Jean Claude's facial expressions looked stiff for the most part but he was the worst of the bunch and still did pretty good for himself.While fighting battles with no of chance winning, some of Jean Claude's past catches up with him but the heart of the story is between the main characters and the story remains that way until the end which was a good choice.I was completely surprised this wasn't your standard B-action flick. It is actually a very good movie with great sets and superb battle scenes. The cinematography in the desert is one of the finer points of the movie. No stylized action and the movie is all the better for it. We don't need to see Jean Claude doing super kicks and taking out everybody who has a gun with his bare 2 hands. We have seen that way too many times. You could tell it was right at this point in his career that he wanted to start doing better movies and he has put out about 4 good movies since this. Things are definitely looking up for the man who's first starring role was in Ng See Yuen's 'No Retreat, No Surrender'(AKA Karate Tiger). The movie gets a 3.5 from me but I can only pick a 3 or a 4. I don't know if I would watch it again since I am a hardcore action junkie but it was damn good movie.This is a great DVD release from Sterling Entertainment. Picture is widecreened in a letterboxed format. Only 2-channel sound but still pretty good.Special features include a 7 minute behind the scenes. It has an interview with one of the producers where he talks about Jean Claude. It also has an interview with the director and you get a little bit of a look behind the scenes.There is a French Foreign Legion section and has a good interview with an historian. This is very good information wise and briefly tells how the Legion came to be and a bit about what happens after this movie. Best special feature on here. Also in this section is a very brief recent look at the FFL, text given on descriptions of weapons used, and a still gallery of filming the movie.There is also a commentary with the writer of the movie.The back of the DVD case also says that it has a commentary from a FFL expert and I was very disappointed not to find that on the disc.",

I mean yeah of course this isn't Lawrence of Arabia or Saving private ryan, but then again what else is?

A great film to watch if you are sick at home or just plain out of your mind bored.

    "review/text": "...and that's not saying much. Depsite his almost Chuck Norris acting and fighting abilities, this is one of his better films which offers a rather nostalgic and romantic setting in the Sahara with La Legion Etrangere.The plot is somewhat simple. Jean-Claude is a fighter who's on bad terms with a mob boss and has to leave his friends and his loved one behind to seek refuge in the barracks of the French Foreign Legion. He hopes to serve his term, make some dough, and hopefully join with his lover who left for America. The barracks are harsh and no one can be trusted. Despite his efforts to run, his past soon catches up with him and he needs to make his stand.This is certainly one of Van Damme's better films along with 'The Quest' with Roger Moore. A short film that starts out rather well but soon loses steam about half-way through: the plot becomes unusually rushed and the characters start losing their dimensions to become card-board cut outs. Probably a good film for the typical Van Damme crowd which are young prepubescent males. Enjoy!",

His crying fit after some guy he barely knew died were punctuated by \"HE WAS A LEGIONAIRE\" in his cheesy french accent.One of the villians in the pointless plot is apparently a cruel officer in this legion. Apparently, this guy likes to torture his men and leave them to die. He also likes to punish them for making the RIGHT decesions, while he makes horrible blunders left and right. What I don't understand is why this person dissapears into thin air soon after we learn about his character. I mean, this plot is just horrible. Lets go on to a better example.Another of Van Dammes buddies is sent out for some ungodly stupid mission, that we all know will fail no matter what. Van Damme and this character open up a stupid, overdramatic scene about how they love eachother or something, and this guy goes off on his way. Well not really, since he is shown being tortured by the rifs the next day, and for some reason Van Damme shoots him. Of course the movie wanted it to be clear that Van Damme puts him out of his misery, but it was just such a idiotic situation where Van Damme could have attempted to save him based on his superhuman marsmanship and physical strength as portrayed in this movie.One final thing, Can someone explain to me how a human being can shoot a gatling gun with great accuracy while standing up and holding it, not to mention this person has apparently just suffered a long march through the desert.I really can't continue, as I will have flashbacks of this movie and will be disgusted to the point of nausea.One look at the damn DVD cover and you can see what a cheesy, overdramatic, \"epic\" with a pointless plot this movie is.Van Damme should stick to what he does best, fake being a martial artist..",
